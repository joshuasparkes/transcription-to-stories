00:27:51.852 --> 00:27:55.179
<v Josh Sparkes>disrupt it.
All of that positive stuff is what we're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2832-2
00:27:55.179 --> 00:27:59.385
<v Josh Sparkes>asking them today as well. Thank you.
Disrupt it. Yeah, like that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2832-3
00:27:59.385 --> 00:28:03.465
<v Josh Sparkes>Creative disruption. Yeah,
this is just what we spoke about last</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2832-4
00:28:03.465 --> 00:28:05.537
<v Josh Sparkes>week, really. So we talked about.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2851-0
00:28:06.257 --> 00:28:11.133
<v Josh Sparkes>Grouping of teams and we decided we're
gonna have an e-billing UK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2851-1
00:28:11.133 --> 00:28:15.137
<v Josh Sparkes>an e-billing Australia and an e-billing
overall group.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2900-0
00:28:16.617 --> 00:28:19.107
<v Josh Sparkes>And we're going to use a skills matrix
method.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2900-1
00:28:19.107 --> 00:28:23.135
<v Josh Sparkes>So if we can see you guys skills matrix,
we can say when a case lands here,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2900-2
00:28:23.135 --> 00:28:26.527
<v Josh Sparkes>if it's about topic A,
it goes to someone that's specialised in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2900-3
00:28:26.527 --> 00:28:28.805
<v Josh Sparkes>that.
So it's kind of automated routing of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2900-4
00:28:28.805 --> 00:28:32.780
<v Josh Sparkes>cases, which hopefully that automat.
I think that's one of the pain points</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2900-5
00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.377
<v Josh Sparkes>that you guys mentioned that that'll be
helpful.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2927-0
00:28:35.857 --> 00:28:41.183
<v Josh Sparkes>We did an exercise. Sorry,
can we go back to the previous slide,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2927-1
00:28:41.183 --> 00:28:45.608
<v Josh Sparkes>Josh? Excuse me,
what's the purpose of the understand</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2927-2
00:28:45.608 --> 00:28:51.017
<v Josh Sparkes>skills matrix and where we're going with
the different groupings?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2979-0
00:28:51.297 --> 00:28:56.702
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that just a breakdown of our current
teams or is it what you're thinking about</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2979-1
00:28:56.702 --> 00:29:00.657
<v Josh Sparkes>going forward? Yeah,
that's the plan for for going forward.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2979-2
00:29:00.657 --> 00:29:03.557
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So within the the different localised</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2979-3
00:29:03.557 --> 00:29:08.435
<v Josh Sparkes>teams, there's those horizontals,
but there's different kind of roles and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/2979-4
00:29:08.435 --> 00:29:10.017
<v Josh Sparkes>rights within the teams.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3012-0
00:29:10.337 --> 00:29:13.145
<v Josh Sparkes>So there could be a a user in the e-mail
in UK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3012-1
00:29:13.145 --> 00:29:16.421
<v Josh Sparkes>could be a they're going to be a manager
there as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3012-2
00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:20.868
<v Josh Sparkes>And those I mean all the little user
faces that's just thrown in for to see</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3012-3
00:29:20.868 --> 00:29:24.788
<v Josh Sparkes>what what it is. But yeah,
different roles within different teams,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3012-4
00:29:24.788 --> 00:29:26.017
<v Josh Sparkes>horizontal, vertical.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3057-0
00:29:26.417 --> 00:29:31.480
<v Josh Sparkes>What's the is the query that just is that
what we do today versus what the plan is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3057-1
00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.835
<v Josh Sparkes>for the future? Yeah,
this is what we we took from our</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3057-2
00:29:34.835 --> 00:29:38.495
<v Josh Sparkes>discussion. But yeah,
please if listen from my perspective,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3057-3
00:29:38.495 --> 00:29:43.436
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not for anything in terms of change
and what does good look like and I think</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3057-4
00:29:43.436 --> 00:29:45.937
<v Josh Sparkes>this is an opportunity for us to explore.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3100-0
00:29:45.937 --> 00:29:50.571
<v Josh Sparkes>What does good look like?
Is e-bill in a team that we can do</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3100-1
00:29:50.571 --> 00:29:54.521
<v Josh Sparkes>globally?
Does it have to be questioned in my mind?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3100-2
00:29:54.521 --> 00:30:00.371
<v Josh Sparkes>Might scare the horses a little bit,
but does it have to be UK and Os split?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3100-3
00:30:00.371 --> 00:30:03.865
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
could it just be first cab off the rank</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3100-4
00:30:03.865 --> 00:30:04.777
<v Josh Sparkes>and goes to?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3142-0
00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:08.141
<v Josh Sparkes>And we might not be there yet,
but I'm just,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3142-1
00:30:08.141 --> 00:30:12.541
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just trying to get my head around
where you know the the direction of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3142-2
00:30:12.541 --> 00:30:16.882
<v Josh Sparkes>travel, the way we're split here,
I suppose direction travel would be what</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3142-3
00:30:16.882 --> 00:30:20.413
<v Josh Sparkes>a workflow. So yeah,
you've got an invoice that's coming in,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3142-4
00:30:20.413 --> 00:30:22.497
<v Josh Sparkes>you have to process it in the story.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3185-0
00:30:22.537 --> 00:30:25.344
<v Josh Sparkes>Can be globalised,
but how it starts its journey,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3185-1
00:30:25.344 --> 00:30:28.321
<v Josh Sparkes>those trigger points is what we're
discussing today.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3185-2
00:30:28.321 --> 00:30:32.701
<v Josh Sparkes>Who raised it in which country? Yeah,
the heavy lifting from ServiceNow could</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3185-3
00:30:32.701 --> 00:30:35.845
<v Josh Sparkes>say, well, it goes to this group.
If it's over a value,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3185-4
00:30:35.845 --> 00:30:39.158
<v Josh Sparkes>you can assign it further.
Maybe it needs more authorised,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3185-5
00:30:39.158 --> 00:30:40.057
<v Josh Sparkes>but the overall.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3198-0
00:30:40.057 --> 00:30:42.935
<v Josh Sparkes>Global story is probably similar,
you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3198-1
00:30:42.935 --> 00:30:47.057
<v Josh Sparkes>so that's what we're that probably the
overview of that, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3193-0
00:30:44.457 --> 00:30:45.177
<v Mark Sedgey>See it it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3234-0
00:30:46.817 --> 00:30:50.988
<v Mark Sedgey>If it help, if it helps.
So the underlying thing we're trying to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3234-1
00:30:50.988 --> 00:30:55.865
<v Mark Sedgey>do is get organizational efficiency.
So what can we get the right ticket to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3234-2
00:30:55.865 --> 00:30:59.522
<v Mark Sedgey>the right person who can solve it more
most effectively?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3234-3
00:30:59.522 --> 00:31:01.897
<v Mark Sedgey>So you know how you're structured is.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3288-0
00:31:01.977 --> 00:31:06.505
<v Mark Sedgey>Is or should be orchestrated to enable
that to happen really efficiently.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3288-1
00:31:06.505 --> 00:31:10.788
<v Mark Sedgey>So it doesn't necessarily need to be a
geographic geographical split,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3288-2
00:31:10.788 --> 00:31:15.623
<v Mark Sedgey>but what it does need to be is if your
groupings in such a way that, as I say,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3288-3
00:31:15.623 --> 00:31:20.457
<v Mark Sedgey>the right ticket gets to the right person
who can resolve it most efficiently.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3328-0
00:31:20.217 --> 00:31:24.117
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.
I was just trying to just where we were</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3292-0
00:31:20.537 --> 00:31:22.457
<v Mark Sedgey>Does that help that sort of thinking?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3328-1
00:31:24.117 --> 00:31:27.792
<v Josh Sparkes>land.
We what the we were going to land on this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3328-2
00:31:27.792 --> 00:31:33.342
<v Josh Sparkes>I know that when you've gone through this
is a setting a global standard,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3328-3
00:31:33.342 --> 00:31:37.017
<v Josh Sparkes>but having as Mark said the right support
model.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3396-0
00:31:37.337 --> 00:31:40.290
<v Josh Sparkes>But you know partners,
lawyers are going to get that bidding</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3396-1
00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:44.114
<v Josh Sparkes>through etcetera in the right time and
get response as they need as quickly as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3396-2
00:31:44.114 --> 00:31:46.874
<v Josh Sparkes>possible as well.
So I think it's about having the right</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3396-3
00:31:46.874 --> 00:31:49.149
<v Josh Sparkes>mix,
but also aligning to that global standard</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3396-4
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:53.119
<v Josh Sparkes>as well and we'll see when we go through
all the processes later why why they are</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3396-5
00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:55.394
<v Josh Sparkes>split as such because you'll be able to
align.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3396-6
00:31:55.394 --> 00:31:57.137
<v Josh Sparkes>This is a Australia focused process.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3442-0
00:31:57.257 --> 00:32:00.746
<v Josh Sparkes>Access it aligns with that team.
So we're seeing more granular detail and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3442-1
00:32:00.746 --> 00:32:04.282
<v Josh Sparkes>that's going to be the same as we go
through. So if we go through and yes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3442-2
00:32:04.282 --> 00:32:08.148
<v Josh Sparkes>I was going to say and it's part of the
first phase is trying to get it there and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3442-3
00:32:08.148 --> 00:32:11.589
<v Josh Sparkes>ready in the platform so you can enable
some of that standardization and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3442-4
00:32:11.589 --> 00:32:12.297
<v Josh Sparkes>simplification.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3484-0
00:32:12.377 --> 00:32:16.366
<v Josh Sparkes>In the future that you might find
actually we can still further consolidate,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3484-1
00:32:16.366 --> 00:32:20.769
<v Josh Sparkes>we can further globalize how we do things.
So this is very much a first phase with a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3484-2
00:32:20.769 --> 00:32:24.809
<v Josh Sparkes>view to how do we push forward in the
future as well and I think E billing is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3484-3
00:32:24.809 --> 00:32:28.177
<v Josh Sparkes>probably one of the processes that we
have the best opportunity.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3528-0
00:32:28.537 --> 00:32:32.655
<v Josh Sparkes>To globalise more than any other process
that we deliver,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3528-1
00:32:32.655 --> 00:32:38.549
<v Josh Sparkes>we do the work globally for every single
country and it's probably and some of our</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3528-2
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:42.313
<v Josh Sparkes>clients are global.
So whether the bill is raised in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3528-3
00:32:42.313 --> 00:32:47.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia or in Hong Kong or in the US,
if it's for Goldman Sachs, it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3564-0
00:32:47.577 --> 00:32:52.437
<v Josh Sparkes>Goldman Sachs e-billing system.
So I just want to make sure that we don't</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3564-1
00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:57.889
<v Josh Sparkes>go down too much of A regionalized view.
So one of the things that I'm going to be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3564-2
00:32:57.889 --> 00:33:00.977
<v Josh Sparkes>pushing these guys on over the next day
or so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3599-0
00:33:03.177 --> 00:33:09.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Is around why have we got an OS process
if we have compared to UK process on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3599-1
00:33:09.101 --> 00:33:15.487
<v Josh Sparkes>e-billing because that doesn't make sense
to me apart from maybe people sitting in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3599-2
00:33:15.487 --> 00:33:19.257
<v Josh Sparkes>different locations,
this process more than any.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3637-0
00:33:19.337 --> 00:33:24.475
<v Josh Sparkes>Could, you know, should be globalized.
How we cheer the work is a different</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3637-1
00:33:24.475 --> 00:33:27.855
<v Josh Sparkes>thing,
but the process could be globalized. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3637-2
00:33:27.855 --> 00:33:33.128
<v Josh Sparkes>just to overlay into Mark's sentiments is
about that efficiency in your admin</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3637-3
00:33:33.128 --> 00:33:35.697
<v Josh Sparkes>process, how much retrospective admin.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3679-0
00:33:36.137 --> 00:33:39.904
<v Josh Sparkes>Or rejection or E billing portal admin
can you do upfront,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3679-1
00:33:39.904 --> 00:33:45.076
<v Josh Sparkes>you know could actually promote those,
you know reduce those error rates or that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3679-2
00:33:45.076 --> 00:33:48.716
<v Josh Sparkes>rejection rate.
So that's also that we consider get that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3679-3
00:33:48.716 --> 00:33:52.355
<v Josh Sparkes>validation upfront,
we could do service now do the heavy</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3679-4
00:33:52.355 --> 00:33:53.377
<v Josh Sparkes>lifting of that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3737-0
00:33:53.577 --> 00:33:57.553
<v Josh Sparkes>Can we come back to this as well after
we've gone through the process and then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3737-1
00:33:57.553 --> 00:34:01.730
<v Josh Sparkes>understand actually could there just be
one global building differentiate between,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3737-2
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:03.944
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
this person's available because of time</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3737-3
00:34:03.944 --> 00:34:07.015
<v Josh Sparkes>zone and schedules.
So now this can be scheduled in terms of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3737-4
00:34:07.015 --> 00:34:10.789
<v Josh Sparkes>the case can also be forwarded,
but we can come back to this as well. Yep,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3737-5
00:34:10.789 --> 00:34:13.457
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll see the scene spreading,
but absolutely agree.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3780-0
00:34:13.537 --> 00:34:18.122
<v Josh Sparkes>Heading to global 100%. OK, yes,
we did a really good exercise last week.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3780-1
00:34:18.122 --> 00:34:22.707
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you for those pain points.
That's one of the best intakes I've seen</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3780-2
00:34:22.707 --> 00:34:25.929
<v Josh Sparkes>in my time.
This is kind of a high level summary of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3780-3
00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:29.337
<v Josh Sparkes>some of the things.
We can fit them all on the screen.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3817-0
00:34:29.897 --> 00:34:34.694
<v Josh Sparkes>And we're going to make sure that we we
keep these in mind as as we go through</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3817-1
00:34:34.694 --> 00:34:39.066
<v Josh Sparkes>and we'll bear these with us in design
looking into the the bulk of it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3817-2
00:34:39.066 --> 00:34:43.802
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's a little explained what it is
then we'll get into it nearly done with</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3817-3
00:34:43.802 --> 00:34:45.017
<v Josh Sparkes>the with the set up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3820-0
00:34:45.137 --> 00:34:48.137
<v Josh Sparkes>Debra, do you want to say key questions?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3866-0
00:34:49.017 --> 00:34:51.123
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, again,
I think as we go through them,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3866-1
00:34:51.123 --> 00:34:55.144
<v Josh Sparkes>we might combine some of them so we don't
have to repeat, you know, upload invoice.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3866-2
00:34:55.144 --> 00:34:59.021
<v Josh Sparkes>I think there was there's quite a few
that we can go through them and say, well,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3866-3
00:34:59.021 --> 00:35:02.181
<v Josh Sparkes>actually we've got different values,
they've got different teams,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3866-4
00:35:02.181 --> 00:35:03.617
<v Josh Sparkes>they've got different clients.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3913-0
00:35:05.617 --> 00:35:09.870
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll be discussing going from each
other and it wouldn't actually fall out.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3913-1
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:14.229
<v Josh Sparkes>You can say well she last week I had this
situation where it was an over value of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3913-2
00:35:14.229 --> 00:35:16.940
<v Josh Sparkes>100,000,
it gets processed in a different way that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3913-3
00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.077
<v Josh Sparkes>is authorisation,
but we it is those key considerations or</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3913-4
00:35:20.077 --> 00:35:22.257
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe we can consolidate it with this or.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3962-0
00:35:22.697 --> 00:35:27.216
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, as part of the upload invoice,
maybe the client has already got to be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3962-1
00:35:27.216 --> 00:35:30.379
<v Josh Sparkes>onboarded before.
So I only want invoices for an active</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3962-2
00:35:30.379 --> 00:35:34.276
<v Josh Sparkes>client rather than an in that,
you know that that look up that could</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3962-3
00:35:34.276 --> 00:35:37.101
<v Josh Sparkes>happen.
So we're going to go through it hopefully</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3962-4
00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:39.417
<v Josh Sparkes>in an order that we thought was sensible.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3998-0
00:35:39.737 --> 00:35:43.910
<v Josh Sparkes>And then start going through them.
There are two complex ones, Tim,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3998-1
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:48.083
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that you had identified that we
need further clarification,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3998-2
00:35:48.083 --> 00:35:52.502
<v Josh Sparkes>but we'll probably do those last because
actually having reviewed them,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/3998-3
00:35:52.502 --> 00:35:56.737
<v Josh Sparkes>they will probably be easier to sign off
when we discuss the others.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4001-0
00:35:57.417 --> 00:35:59.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4064-0
00:36:01.337 --> 00:36:04.026
<v Josh Sparkes>Again, I don't,
I don't want it to be a checklist.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4064-1
00:36:04.026 --> 00:36:07.980
<v Josh Sparkes>If you look at it and go, Oh my gosh,
we're going to be here and not we're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4064-2
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.881
<v Josh Sparkes>going to be here later than time.
But then the things in my mind as we're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4064-3
00:36:11.881 --> 00:36:15.888
<v Josh Sparkes>talking just prompt us for me, you know,
like do I have to do this quickly?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4064-4
00:36:15.888 --> 00:36:18.208
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
is this for a VIP or is it got an</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4064-5
00:36:18.208 --> 00:36:20.897
<v Josh Sparkes>exception or is there a scenario that's
different?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4103-0
00:36:21.177 --> 00:36:25.406
<v Josh Sparkes>That's some of the things that we're
thinking about in the back of our minds</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4103-1
00:36:25.406 --> 00:36:29.306
<v Josh Sparkes>when we're doing the ServiceNow
transformation that makes the form and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4103-2
00:36:29.306 --> 00:36:31.888
<v Josh Sparkes>that experience for what we call the
customer,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4103-3
00:36:31.888 --> 00:36:35.349
<v Josh Sparkes>but the customer could be the requester,
it could be yourself.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4103-4
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:36.777
<v Josh Sparkes>So as it changes its date.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4115-0
00:36:37.177 --> 00:36:41.685
<v Josh Sparkes>It is that experience for everybody to
make it more efficient each second away.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4115-1
00:36:41.685 --> 00:36:44.277
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So we'll we'll bear all these things in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4115-2
00:36:44.277 --> 00:36:44.897
<v Josh Sparkes>mind, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4171-0
00:36:45.977 --> 00:36:48.909
<v Josh Sparkes>Consolidation then.
So you'll see when we get to the the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4171-1
00:36:48.909 --> 00:36:52.716
<v Josh Sparkes>workbook that we've grouped a lot of the
processes into single things and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4171-2
00:36:52.716 --> 00:36:56.369
<v Josh Sparkes>Deborah's touched on it there.
What things can be grouped in a logical</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4171-3
00:36:56.369 --> 00:37:00.124
<v Josh Sparkes>way that makes it a lot simpler for you
guys and also for the employees,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4171-4
00:37:00.124 --> 00:37:03.777
<v Josh Sparkes>which therefore makes them use the system
more, which therefore makes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4220-0
00:37:03.977 --> 00:37:07.897
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a it's a positive cycle.
So we just have some kind of general</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4220-1
00:37:07.897 --> 00:37:11.993
<v Josh Sparkes>rules as to when we consolidate,
but have to be challenged on consult</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4220-2
00:37:11.993 --> 00:37:16.264
<v Josh Sparkes>consolidation as we go through. Generally,
if you look at the top right,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4220-3
00:37:16.264 --> 00:37:18.897
<v Josh Sparkes>fewer catalog items,
better user experience.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4258-0
00:37:19.377 --> 00:37:23.053
<v Josh Sparkes>Kind of makes sense everyone.
It's the the like if there's 150 things</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4258-1
00:37:23.053 --> 00:37:26.519
<v Josh Sparkes>for e-billing in there,
people are going to think what's you know</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4258-2
00:37:26.519 --> 00:37:29.407
<v Josh Sparkes>what to pick.
But if there's only a few and that makes</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4258-3
00:37:29.407 --> 00:37:33.714
<v Josh Sparkes>sense, then it's it's better experience.
You might have some asked frequent asked</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4258-4
00:37:33.714 --> 00:37:34.817
<v Josh Sparkes>questions about that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4292-0
00:37:34.937 --> 00:37:39.775
<v Josh Sparkes>That clears it up. It is clearer.
We can kind of handle all the different</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4292-1
00:37:39.775 --> 00:37:44.547
<v Josh Sparkes>intricacies generally of of these
different requests within one item and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4292-2
00:37:44.547 --> 00:37:47.816
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll see that when we get into the the
workbook,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4292-3
00:37:47.816 --> 00:37:50.497
<v Josh Sparkes>but that is a process as to where we are.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4325-0
00:37:52.057 --> 00:37:58.697
<v Josh Sparkes>And here's just a kind of example view.
Deborah, if you want to speak to this one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4325-1
00:37:58.697 --> 00:38:02.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, again,
it's just having gone through your</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4325-2
00:38:02.537 --> 00:38:07.497
<v Josh Sparkes>processes, I've seen the onboarding,
e-billing, admin, admin.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4369-0
00:38:07.737 --> 00:38:11.771
<v Josh Sparkes>Managing invoices where you've got
uploading, amending,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4369-1
00:38:11.771 --> 00:38:16.237
<v Josh Sparkes>rejection rates seemed quite high given
my it seems like 18%.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4369-2
00:38:16.237 --> 00:38:21.135
<v Josh Sparkes>It was quite a high percentage.
So I thought if we could maybe take</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4369-3
00:38:21.135 --> 00:38:24.737
<v Josh Sparkes>managed invoice as a service as a
recommendation.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4418-0
00:38:25.177 --> 00:38:29.374
<v Josh Sparkes>A lot of that rejection rate and admin
and all the stuff that you have to do</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4418-1
00:38:29.374 --> 00:38:33.298
<v Josh Sparkes>retrospectively we could address.
So that's why I've consolidated it in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4418-2
00:38:33.298 --> 00:38:37.168
<v Josh Sparkes>this way. Challenge it of course,
but I've done it in sort of an order</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4418-3
00:38:37.168 --> 00:38:41.637
<v Josh Sparkes>where you've got that onboarding time and
keeper rates and then managing invoices</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4418-4
00:38:41.637 --> 00:38:44.417
<v Josh Sparkes>and with any admin on the half of that.
Yes, Ruth.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4457-0
00:38:44.697 --> 00:38:51.179
<v Josh Sparkes>18 OK, no, 80%, I think 18 percent, yes,
1/8, correct. So I can solve it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4457-1
00:38:51.179 --> 00:38:56.960
<v Josh Sparkes>I've grouped them as our recommendation
for the ServiceNow again,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4457-2
00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:02.215
<v Josh Sparkes>but challenge that.
But we can work through that as as your</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4457-3
00:39:02.215 --> 00:39:03.617
<v Josh Sparkes>processes, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4496-0
00:39:04.377 --> 00:39:09.067
<v Josh Sparkes>And this is we're going to be looking at
a spreadsheet in the back that looks a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4496-1
00:39:09.067 --> 00:39:13.464
<v Josh Sparkes>bit like that in the background.
Here I'm trying to just explain what each</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4496-2
00:39:13.464 --> 00:39:16.278
<v Josh Sparkes>section is.
So you'll see this red initial view</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4496-3
00:39:16.278 --> 00:39:18.975
<v Josh Sparkes>column.
It essentially means this is the work</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4496-4
00:39:18.975 --> 00:39:20.617
<v Josh Sparkes>that's been done already on.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4558-0
00:39:20.617 --> 00:39:24.532
<v Josh Sparkes>What so that's what Tim's done and what
we think it could be, for example,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4558-1
00:39:24.532 --> 00:39:27.091
<v Josh Sparkes>what we think the group should be for a
process.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4558-2
00:39:27.091 --> 00:39:31.059
<v Josh Sparkes>If you guys have responded in there,
we've included that response and we've</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4558-3
00:39:31.059 --> 00:39:35.027
<v Josh Sparkes>also included our recommendation for all
of these as well. But as Deb said,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4558-4
00:39:35.027 --> 00:39:38.577
<v Josh Sparkes>this is a great for you guys to challenge
us. If this doesn't work,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4558-5
00:39:38.577 --> 00:39:40.457
<v Josh Sparkes>please let us know and we will just.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4599-0
00:39:40.537 --> 00:39:43.560
<v Josh Sparkes>To that as needed if there's regulatory
needs or etcetera.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4599-1
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.710
<v Josh Sparkes>But we have tried to consider everything
and we'll try to come to a decision for</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4599-2
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:51.092
<v Josh Sparkes>everything in this column here.
It's kind of a workshop decision.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4599-3
00:39:51.092 --> 00:39:54.729
<v Josh Sparkes>I've filled any of that now,
but we want to get through that if we can</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4599-4
00:39:54.729 --> 00:39:55.857
<v Josh Sparkes>get all of those done.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4638-0
00:39:56.137 --> 00:40:00.392
<v Josh Sparkes>We can go ahead and start moving on with
the with the system.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4638-1
00:40:00.392 --> 00:40:04.785
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think we're we're going to start
getting into it. Deborah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4638-2
00:40:04.785 --> 00:40:08.560
<v Josh Sparkes>if I drive the laptop,
if you want to talk through it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4638-3
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:13.708
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean you might hopefully when you see
you sort of say actually we've got</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4638-4
00:40:13.708 --> 00:40:14.257
<v Josh Sparkes>another.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4691-0
00:40:14.697 --> 00:40:17.350
<v Josh Sparkes>So the processes or we might have a
etcetera,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4691-1
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:22.137
<v Josh Sparkes>but I have consolidated them maybe in an
order which was logical to me of a client</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4691-2
00:40:22.137 --> 00:40:25.078
<v Josh Sparkes>onboarding.
Now I've seen your process that you've</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4691-3
00:40:25.078 --> 00:40:29.519
<v Josh Sparkes>got client onboarding and onboarding.
I was thinking is there other you know</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4691-4
00:40:29.519 --> 00:40:33.960
<v Josh Sparkes>just give you the names differentiates
from people onboarding which they did</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4691-5
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:34.537
<v Josh Sparkes>last week.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4723-0
00:40:34.577 --> 00:40:37.812
<v Josh Sparkes>So once you avoid calling on just
onboarding,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4723-1
00:40:37.812 --> 00:40:43.649
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be client and vendor onboarding.
Is that it's moving forward calling it a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4723-2
00:40:43.649 --> 00:40:48.290
<v Josh Sparkes>recommendation client or boarding
sufficient or does that capture</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4723-3
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:49.697
<v Josh Sparkes>everything that you?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4781-0
00:40:49.697 --> 00:40:53.904
<v Josh Sparkes>I just asked Deborah since even we're
looking at this from a client on board</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4781-1
00:40:53.904 --> 00:40:56.746
<v Josh Sparkes>and thank you for the rates, maintenance,
etcetera.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4781-2
00:40:56.746 --> 00:41:00.516
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that what the forms will be on the
portal for people to ask? Yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4781-3
00:41:00.516 --> 00:41:03.576
<v Josh Sparkes>So it will be, yes,
it will be from the requester side.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4781-4
00:41:03.576 --> 00:41:08.057
<v Josh Sparkes>It will be client onboarding or a another
name client and vendor onboarding, yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4825-0
00:41:08.577 --> 00:41:11.951
<v Josh Sparkes>I think what we need to just think about
is Lauren Megan,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4825-1
00:41:11.951 --> 00:41:16.371
<v Josh Sparkes>the language that your requesters would
be aware of and what they would do.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4825-2
00:41:16.371 --> 00:41:21.316
<v Josh Sparkes>And I'd probably ask like Lauren Simon as
well from a service catalogue perspective,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4825-3
00:41:21.316 --> 00:41:25.853
<v Josh Sparkes>if we can look at what e-billings under
just now and see if we can align that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4825-4
00:41:25.853 --> 00:41:26.377
<v Josh Sparkes>language.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4826-0
00:41:26.537 --> 00:41:26.697
<v Josh Sparkes>But.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4864-0
00:41:29.937 --> 00:41:33.209
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I mean,
I mean the question would be I want to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4864-1
00:41:33.209 --> 00:41:38.334
<v Josh Sparkes>onboard a new client or I want, you know,
the the dialogue would be the following.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4864-2
00:41:38.334 --> 00:41:40.866
<v Josh Sparkes>No,
that would be some culture for those</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4864-3
00:41:40.866 --> 00:41:44.571
<v Josh Sparkes>three processes.
I don't know why there is 3 belongs to me,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4864-4
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:45.497
<v Josh Sparkes>why there is 3.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4908-0
00:41:45.697 --> 00:41:48.974
<v Josh Sparkes>All these processes were captured before
manager,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4908-1
00:41:48.974 --> 00:41:53.692
<v Josh Sparkes>so a lot of the stuff is duplicated and
lots of stuff could be wiped up</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4908-2
00:41:53.692 --> 00:41:57.952
<v Josh Sparkes>completely. OK, I mean,
that's reassuring to hear because having</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4908-3
00:41:57.952 --> 00:42:02.737
<v Josh Sparkes>read a lot of them, you've got on,
you know, new onboarding, onboarding.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4958-0
00:42:03.297 --> 00:42:06.653
<v Josh Sparkes>Like new client and then onboarding like
new new new clients.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4958-1
00:42:06.653 --> 00:42:10.118
<v Josh Sparkes>Are they are they one of the same? Yeah,
it'll all be the same.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4958-2
00:42:10.118 --> 00:42:14.287
<v Josh Sparkes>It'll be a new client that we haven't
emailed before and they've asked us to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4958-3
00:42:14.287 --> 00:42:18.185
<v Josh Sparkes>upload the invoice to a portal.
So it'll be else taking away contacting</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/4958-4
00:42:18.185 --> 00:42:21.217
<v Josh Sparkes>the client, contacting the portal,
getting them set up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5002-0
00:42:21.337 --> 00:42:27.179
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can enable our invoice to go into
the system. Great. OK. And that client,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5002-1
00:42:27.179 --> 00:42:32.583
<v Josh Sparkes>just asking you some questions,
it could have been a previous client that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5002-2
00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:36.454
<v Josh Sparkes>are now inactive and then you might
reactivate them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5002-3
00:42:36.454 --> 00:42:38.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Could they be a child of a parent?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5048-0
00:42:39.937 --> 00:42:43.343
<v Josh Sparkes>Clients. No,
it'll be the ultimate client is the one</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5048-1
00:42:43.343 --> 00:42:48.163
<v Josh Sparkes>that we, right? It's one to one, yes.
So if there's multiple subsidiaries,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5048-2
00:42:48.163 --> 00:42:51.312
<v Josh Sparkes>it always goes into the main profile,
right? OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5048-3
00:42:51.312 --> 00:42:54.589
<v Josh Sparkes>so this is the main parent onboarding
essentially.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5048-4
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:59.217
<v Josh Sparkes>And how do you handle subsidiaries?
They just considered child of that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5083-0
00:42:59.297 --> 00:43:04.480
<v Josh Sparkes>Onboarded client. OK,
so you could have two subsidiaries in two</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5083-1
00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:08.611
<v Josh Sparkes>locations,
but you're still dealing with it in the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5083-2
00:43:08.611 --> 00:43:13.308
<v Josh Sparkes>one in the one. OK,
can I just check onboarding a client?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5083-3
00:43:13.308 --> 00:43:15.657
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you ever onboard a matter?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5096-0
00:43:16.457 --> 00:43:20.331
<v Josh Sparkes>Or is it all done from the client
perspective? It's all.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5096-1
00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:24.137
<v Josh Sparkes>It's down to the client himself. Yes.
Yeah. OK. Thanks.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5144-0
00:43:25.937 --> 00:43:28.317
<v Josh Sparkes>I just check,
is this in the theme of kind of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5144-1
00:43:28.317 --> 00:43:30.956
<v Josh Sparkes>globalisations,
is this a a process that as you're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5144-2
00:43:30.956 --> 00:43:33.491
<v Josh Sparkes>onboarding these new clients and these
entities,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5144-3
00:43:33.491 --> 00:43:37.164
<v Josh Sparkes>particularly the parent entities,
that's a global approach and process</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5144-4
00:43:37.164 --> 00:43:40.269
<v Josh Sparkes>pretty much, yeah.
But sometimes the client will onboard us</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5144-5
00:43:40.269 --> 00:43:42.804
<v Josh Sparkes>globally,
sometimes it will be specific offices.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5144-6
00:43:42.804 --> 00:43:45.857
<v Josh Sparkes>So then we have to repeat the process for
every office we.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5151-0
00:43:45.937 --> 00:43:50.377
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's still done centrally. It's yeah,
OK, I won't.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5191-0
00:43:51.617 --> 00:43:55.302
<v Josh Sparkes>And then from that,
sorry to not to go out too many answer</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5191-1
00:43:55.302 --> 00:43:58.175
<v Josh Sparkes>then,
but for specific offices you would then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5191-2
00:43:58.175 --> 00:44:03.234
<v Josh Sparkes>have different regulatory and compliance
issues for them or the right to work in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5191-3
00:44:03.234 --> 00:44:06.857
<v Josh Sparkes>that country, you know,
do you have free checks for that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5207-0
00:44:07.217 --> 00:44:10.587
<v Josh Sparkes>That we would do,
you might back and buy legal would do,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5207-1
00:44:10.587 --> 00:44:14.490
<v Josh Sparkes>they would do that. Yeah.
So this is your effectively the request</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5207-2
00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:15.377
<v Josh Sparkes>is to on board.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5244-0
00:44:18.857 --> 00:44:24.987
<v Josh Sparkes>So it sounds like this makes sense
consolidating those because they're all</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5244-1
00:44:24.987 --> 00:44:31.771
<v Josh Sparkes>somewhat the same and sounds like client
onboarding is also makes sense as a name,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5244-2
00:44:31.771 --> 00:44:32.017
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5286-0
00:44:32.897 --> 00:44:36.058
<v Josh Sparkes>Quick question.
So who would make that request to you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5286-1
00:44:36.058 --> 00:44:40.507
<v Josh Sparkes>guys? Where would that come from?
Either it will come from if we're talking</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5286-2
00:44:40.507 --> 00:44:44.429
<v Josh Sparkes>about Europe or Middle East,
it will come from the finance office.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5286-3
00:44:44.429 --> 00:44:48.937
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's Australia, it will be PAS,
London will be PAS or it could come from.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5323-0
00:44:49.377 --> 00:44:52.220
<v Josh Sparkes>I think this is it could come from a
partner,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5323-1
00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Josh Sparkes>it could come from a credit control team,
for example,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5323-2
00:44:55.620 --> 00:45:00.442
<v Josh Sparkes>through the portal to raise it rather
than say that an e-mail to you guys and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5323-3
00:45:00.442 --> 00:45:05.388
<v Josh Sparkes>they came through the portal and they
were faced with a option to see client on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5323-4
00:45:05.388 --> 00:45:08.417
<v Josh Sparkes>board and would they know what that means?
Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5357-0
00:45:08.617 --> 00:45:12.604
<v Josh Sparkes>It's paying for them.
We don't need anything like e-billing in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5357-1
00:45:12.604 --> 00:45:16.275
<v Josh Sparkes>there or anything.
Like I don't know what's there. Maybe.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5357-2
00:45:16.275 --> 00:45:18.933
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
it's like before that you've got in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5357-3
00:45:18.933 --> 00:45:23.427
<v Josh Sparkes>client on boarding to make it.
So one we got a change to the NBI form,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5357-4
00:45:23.427 --> 00:45:24.377
<v Josh Sparkes>didn't we? Yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5403-0
00:45:24.417 --> 00:45:28.750
<v Josh Sparkes>To see this is an e-billing client,
this is, this is really,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5403-1
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:34.221
<v Josh Sparkes>this is probably one of our key end to
end processes across the whole of the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5403-2
00:45:34.221 --> 00:45:37.489
<v Josh Sparkes>firm,
which I think probably the questions we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5403-3
00:45:37.489 --> 00:45:43.101
<v Josh Sparkes>are doing is trying to land where are we
jumping in to the middle of a process</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5403-4
00:45:43.101 --> 00:45:43.457
<v Josh Sparkes>here.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5409-0
00:45:43.977 --> 00:45:48.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Because it will start before it gets to
the e-billing team.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5448-0
00:45:50.097 --> 00:45:54.397
<v Josh Sparkes>That'd be fair to see.
So that's why you're going to get it from</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5448-1
00:45:54.397 --> 00:45:59.095
<v Josh Sparkes>one of many different sources.
And I think the fact is on your person,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5448-2
00:45:59.095 --> 00:46:03.264
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got partners, PE, credit control,
relationship manners,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5448-3
00:46:03.264 --> 00:46:07.697
<v Josh Sparkes>other people that probably have that
visibility or can trigger it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5507-0
00:46:08.497 --> 00:46:13.058
<v Mark Sedgey>That that was going to be a question I
was going to ask is the the trigger point</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5507-1
00:46:13.058 --> 00:46:15.817
<v Mark Sedgey>is when you confirm the commercials,
doesn't it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5507-2
00:46:15.817 --> 00:46:20.322
<v Mark Sedgey>So you know well before you get to hear
if you're going through your commercial</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5507-3
00:46:20.322 --> 00:46:24.939
<v Mark Sedgey>negotiations and then you confirm you're
going to do some work doesn't that isn't</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5507-4
00:46:24.939 --> 00:46:27.417
<v Mark Sedgey>you know that is the point of trigger
when.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5501-0
00:46:27.577 --> 00:46:28.457
<v Josh Sparkes>It should.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5511-0
00:46:28.017 --> 00:46:29.897
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, someone signed something.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5567-0
00:46:30.097 --> 00:46:33.110
<v Josh Sparkes>It should,
but most of the time we're not very good</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5567-1
00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:37.224
<v Josh Sparkes>at communicating information.
So we most of the time we don't get told</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5567-2
00:46:37.224 --> 00:46:41.976
<v Josh Sparkes>until that in Westlands and every box to
upload. So we've got yes what's upwards.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5567-3
00:46:41.976 --> 00:46:45.337
<v Josh Sparkes>So with the MBI,
I'm just talking about getting ticked as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5567-4
00:46:45.337 --> 00:46:49.857
<v Josh Sparkes>we're doing checks regulate to see if
there are any new clients so we can be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5604-0
00:46:50.177 --> 00:46:54.358
<v Josh Sparkes>Being proactive rather than being
reactive. So Mark,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5604-1
00:46:54.358 --> 00:46:59.960
<v Josh Sparkes>you're you're absolutely right.
Theoretically you what you see is 100%</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5578-0
00:46:56.297 --> 00:46:56.697
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5604-2
00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.589
<v Josh Sparkes>accurate.
The reality is the terms may not be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5604-3
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:07.297
<v Josh Sparkes>agreed and the first time we're trying to
get.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5648-0
00:47:07.777 --> 00:47:13.740
<v Josh Sparkes>It is when we get the bill out and it's
when a partner is going, oh damn it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5648-1
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:19.703
<v Josh Sparkes>I need to get a bill out and I've not
created and kicked off the process and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5628-0
00:47:19.177 --> 00:47:19.417
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5648-2
00:47:19.703 --> 00:47:24.737
<v Josh Sparkes>it's everybody's running fast to get the
bill out for month end.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5704-0
00:47:25.417 --> 00:47:30.438
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the checks that we then do could
sometimes be short circuited.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5704-1
00:47:30.438 --> 00:47:35.738
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's a minimum amount of checks
that we have to deliver before we can</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5704-2
00:47:35.738 --> 00:47:40.969
<v Josh Sparkes>raise a bill and it kind of goes back and
forth between a couple of teams,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5704-3
00:47:40.969 --> 00:47:44.177
<v Josh Sparkes>not in our place, but we're party of it,
the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5686-0
00:47:42.057 --> 00:47:42.217
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5733-0
00:47:44.817 --> 00:47:51.184
<v Josh Sparkes>It might be worthwhile if I share with
you guys and I don't know if you've seen</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5733-1
00:47:51.184 --> 00:47:54.606
<v Josh Sparkes>it,
but the whole end to end client matter</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5733-2
00:47:54.606 --> 00:48:00.177
<v Josh Sparkes>life cycle process where you'll see
there's about 22 people involved.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5770-0
00:48:00.257 --> 00:48:07.036
<v Josh Sparkes>I can organise that to get sent through.
I've got it in a visual.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5742-0
00:48:05.537 --> 00:48:05.817
<v Mark Sedgey>What?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5770-1
00:48:07.036 --> 00:48:12.377
<v Josh Sparkes>An artist come in and draw it. Oh wow,
interesting.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5827-0
00:48:09.697 --> 00:48:14.458
<v Mark Sedgey>So, so one of the things I I think,
I think that's possibly something that I</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5827-1
00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:19.095
<v Mark Sedgey>think there's an opportunity there
potentially to see how we can get early</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5827-2
00:48:19.095 --> 00:48:22.434
<v Mark Sedgey>visibility.
It's not necessarily going to affect what</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5827-3
00:48:22.434 --> 00:48:25.649
<v Mark Sedgey>we do now,
but it might just give you early insight</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5827-4
00:48:25.649 --> 00:48:29.297
<v Mark Sedgey>to kick this process off in a cleaner
fashion. So I think.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5839-0
00:48:29.377 --> 00:48:33.181
<v Mark Sedgey>It's something it'll be worthwhile us
looking at and understanding,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5839-1
00:48:33.181 --> 00:48:37.377
<v Mark Sedgey>but not necessarily for right now,
if that makes sense given where we are.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5878-0
00:48:38.737 --> 00:48:41.580
<v Josh Sparkes>I check in terms like conflict check as
well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5878-1
00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:46.711
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that part of your onboarding process
as well, which is separate to this, right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5878-2
00:48:46.711 --> 00:48:50.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Or is it embedded into this process?
It's embedded into it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5878-3
00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.337
<v Josh Sparkes>so it'll be complaints to them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5870-0
00:48:51.537 --> 00:48:52.377
<v Mark Sedgey>Just.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5918-0
00:48:53.857 --> 00:48:56.634
<v Mark Sedgey>Sorry,
can I ask another question in terms of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5918-1
00:48:56.634 --> 00:48:59.352
<v Mark Sedgey>the any commercial agreements that you
have,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5918-2
00:48:59.352 --> 00:49:04.122
<v Mark Sedgey>are they stored on a contract management
system or something like to where you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5918-3
00:49:04.122 --> 00:49:07.927
<v Mark Sedgey>where your partners enter into an
agreement and what have you,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5918-4
00:49:07.927 --> 00:49:09.497
<v Mark Sedgey>what do they do with that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5953-0
00:49:09.737 --> 00:49:14.632
<v Mark Sedgey>You know that documentation because if
they put if that's in a repository that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5953-1
00:49:14.632 --> 00:49:19.156
<v Mark Sedgey>as soon as something lands in there,
that could be a trigger to get some</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5953-2
00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:22.937
<v Mark Sedgey>output from that to maybe be put us on
the front foot a bit.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5999-0
00:49:23.617 --> 00:49:28.828
<v Josh Sparkes>I agree theoretically.
We have a terms module that sits on one</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5999-1
00:49:28.828 --> 00:49:33.542
<v Josh Sparkes>of their systems.
Can't remember the name of the system.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5999-2
00:49:33.542 --> 00:49:38.588
<v Josh Sparkes>It'll come back to me.
Not all the terms actually sit there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/5999-3
00:49:38.588 --> 00:49:43.137
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a small proportion of our terms
that actually.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6029-0
00:49:44.577 --> 00:49:51.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Are held in a central repository.
That's one of the challenges that we've</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6029-1
00:49:51.897 --> 00:49:59.217
<v Josh Sparkes>got. I don't know if John Glen's online,
right? John has been working on.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6065-0
00:49:59.577 --> 00:50:04.890
<v Josh Sparkes>Identifying some of our terms for a
different team that we'll work on this</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6065-1
00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:09.211
<v Josh Sparkes>week, which is rates,
and he probably would be able to share</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6065-2
00:50:09.211 --> 00:50:14.737
<v Josh Sparkes>some of the complexity and the visibility
of the terms is distinctly lacking.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6067-0
00:50:15.817 --> 00:50:17.537
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's great. Yep.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6064-0
00:50:15.897 --> 00:50:16.297
<v Mark Sedgey>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6136-0
00:50:22.257 --> 00:50:24.922
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry, just so I'm clear,
what are for the e-billing?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6136-1
00:50:24.922 --> 00:50:27.934
<v Josh Sparkes>It just seems like some of the processes
to me aren't clear.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6136-2
00:50:27.934 --> 00:50:30.451
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe it's because I'm comparing to other
clients,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6136-3
00:50:30.451 --> 00:50:34.005
<v Josh Sparkes>but isn't that you onboard your client
like you do your conflict check,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6136-4
00:50:34.005 --> 00:50:36.473
<v Josh Sparkes>you check them,
it's OK to do business with them,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6136-5
00:50:36.473 --> 00:50:39.583
<v Josh Sparkes>there's no PR damage to you guys and then
it triggers that OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6136-6
00:50:39.583 --> 00:50:41.657
<v Josh Sparkes>they're onboard as a client and therefore.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6174-0
00:50:41.697 --> 00:50:47.555
<v Josh Sparkes>And therefore you can build is that it
seems like it's not a separate team that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6174-1
00:50:47.555 --> 00:50:51.803
<v Josh Sparkes>does that or was that actually merged
with your team? No,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6174-2
00:50:51.803 --> 00:50:56.417
<v Josh Sparkes>the conflicts checks are done by risk and
compliance and then.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6196-0
00:50:57.217 --> 00:51:00.404
<v Josh Sparkes>It will be down to the client going.
If we want to be paid,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6196-1
00:51:00.404 --> 00:51:02.900
<v Josh Sparkes>this invoice needs to be uploaded to a
portal,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6196-2
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:06.937
<v Josh Sparkes>so we then need to do that separately.
So that would happen and then we're.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6198-0
00:51:08.017 --> 00:51:09.617
<v Josh Sparkes>on the back end.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6216-0
00:51:12.817 --> 00:51:18.465
<v Josh Sparkes>Do we need to include data onboarding?
Yeah, just yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6216-1
00:51:18.465 --> 00:51:22.097
<v Josh Sparkes>be even in kind of what it would be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6225-0
00:51:23.697 --> 00:51:29.897
<v Josh Sparkes>My first one checks is an e-mail in
client and we don't get any client.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6262-0
00:51:31.377 --> 00:51:34.962
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So you just want to differentiate that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6262-1
00:51:34.962 --> 00:51:38.946
<v Josh Sparkes>it's so you don't get all sorts. Yes.
Yeah. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6262-2
00:51:38.946 --> 00:51:43.647
<v Josh Sparkes>The reason why maybe other processes from
other financial,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6262-3
00:51:43.647 --> 00:51:49.941
<v Josh Sparkes>but but if you had a form one form,
for example, a service and recommendation,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6262-4
00:51:49.941 --> 00:51:50.977
<v Josh Sparkes>you could be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6312-0
00:51:51.177 --> 00:51:56.018
<v Josh Sparkes>Checkbox whether it's the e-billing or
what you're saying maybe the requester</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6312-1
00:51:56.018 --> 00:51:59.245
<v Josh Sparkes>just says just onboard,
they're just sending stuff.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6312-2
00:51:59.245 --> 00:52:03.776
<v Josh Sparkes>So you want to differentiate this
particularly for yourself and we might</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6312-3
00:52:03.776 --> 00:52:08.555
<v Josh Sparkes>come back to that only if there is
various onboarding processes for clients,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6312-4
00:52:08.555 --> 00:52:10.417
<v Josh Sparkes>e-billing, maybe it's another.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6361-0
00:52:10.697 --> 00:52:15.802
<v Josh Sparkes>For other things that it's one form that
is separated by work stream that might be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6361-1
00:52:15.802 --> 00:52:20.046
<v Josh Sparkes>something else we could look at,
but certainly at the moment we can.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6361-2
00:52:20.046 --> 00:52:24.721
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the final part on it will still
be decided based on how the overall</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6361-3
00:52:24.721 --> 00:52:28.903
<v Josh Sparkes>portal looks and how many steps we're
going through that obviously,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6361-4
00:52:28.903 --> 00:52:30.257
<v Josh Sparkes>but if we have client.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6405-0
00:52:30.257 --> 00:52:34.506
<v Josh Sparkes>Onboarding, we have it in ask people,
we'll have other things that set under</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6405-1
00:52:34.506 --> 00:52:37.872
<v Josh Sparkes>client onboarding.
So we need to make sure it's really clear</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6405-2
00:52:37.872 --> 00:52:40.796
<v Josh Sparkes>that it's e-billing. Yes,
people know where they go.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6405-3
00:52:40.796 --> 00:52:44.438
<v Josh Sparkes>So we just capture it.
It may not look like that when it's built,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6405-4
00:52:44.438 --> 00:52:49.018
<v Josh Sparkes>but it just depends what comes before it
and it's certainly separated as a very as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6405-5
00:52:49.018 --> 00:52:50.177
<v Josh Sparkes>a particular process.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6407-0
00:52:52.057 --> 00:52:52.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Have to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6482-0
00:52:53.617 --> 00:52:57.878
<v Josh Sparkes>When I receive an invoice for upload,
the PE might know that that client is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6482-1
00:52:57.878 --> 00:53:00.794
<v Josh Sparkes>already onboarded,
the client is already onboarded,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6482-2
00:53:00.794 --> 00:53:04.775
<v Josh Sparkes>but that specific office that the invoice
is supposed to go to is not.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6482-3
00:53:04.775 --> 00:53:09.540
<v Josh Sparkes>So I get that ticket as an upload because
she she knows that the client's onboarded,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6482-4
00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:13.017
<v Josh Sparkes>but that opposite that must go to
something that whole thing.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6519-0
00:53:13.217 --> 00:53:17.392
<v Josh Sparkes>He's going to change back to client.
So we can also have to be able to trigger</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6519-1
00:53:17.392 --> 00:53:21.092
<v Josh Sparkes>that back to client on board because of
those in the different route.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6519-2
00:53:21.092 --> 00:53:25.109
<v Josh Sparkes>Certainly if you're saying, yeah,
you there's an assumption in May the fact</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6519-3
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:29.337
<v Josh Sparkes>that they're going to be on board or on
board if they can send you the invoice.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6548-0
00:53:29.537 --> 00:53:33.619
<v Josh Sparkes>But you might then have to
retrospectively be saying then have to do</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6548-1
00:53:33.619 --> 00:53:37.820
<v Josh Sparkes>the client on e-billing on boarding,
is that correct? Is that correct?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6548-2
00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.837
<v Josh Sparkes>The client office would have to be on
board. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6548-3
00:53:40.837 --> 00:53:45.097
<v Josh Sparkes>and I think probably as Mark has alluded
to, is those balancing checks.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6591-0
00:53:45.737 --> 00:53:50.276
<v Josh Sparkes>Of upload invoice,
you know have they been on boarded is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6591-1
00:53:50.276 --> 00:53:54.258
<v Josh Sparkes>active.
You know some of that conditions that may</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6591-2
00:53:54.258 --> 00:53:58.718
<v Josh Sparkes>need to be met,
but we'll probably come to that whether</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6591-3
00:53:58.718 --> 00:54:03.337
<v Josh Sparkes>you can receive an invoice for on on
board on on boarded.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6583-0
00:53:59.617 --> 00:54:00.057
Yeah.

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6607-0
00:54:04.017 --> 00:54:07.083
<v Josh Sparkes>Clients,
whether that's an exception that you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6607-1
00:54:07.083 --> 00:54:11.217
<v Josh Sparkes>would accept it and then retrospectively
do that on boarding.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6656-0
00:54:12.657 --> 00:54:15.919
<v Josh Sparkes>Dementia as well.
I know we talked briefly about</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6656-1
00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:19.447
<v Josh Sparkes>potentially using a third party or a term
like that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6656-2
00:54:19.447 --> 00:54:24.107
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's really just for information that
the the employee life cycle,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6656-3
00:54:24.107 --> 00:54:29.433
<v Josh Sparkes>we're splitting that into three groups.
So we've got we're going to have a life</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6656-4
00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:31.297
<v Josh Sparkes>cycle for payroll employees.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6702-0
00:54:31.377 --> 00:54:35.587
<v Josh Sparkes>Life cycle specifically for partners.
And then there's a third category.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6702-1
00:54:35.587 --> 00:54:40.260
<v Josh Sparkes>We're still working with stakeholders to
to find what that's going to be called,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6702-2
00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:43.605
<v Josh Sparkes>but that's going to be essentially people
who invoice us,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6702-3
00:54:43.605 --> 00:54:47.297
<v Josh Sparkes>entities who invoice us need to be on
boarded onto our systems.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6736-0
00:54:47.857 --> 00:54:53.746
<v Josh Sparkes>And third party is is one of the tales
that kind of gets kicked around there as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6736-1
00:54:53.746 --> 00:54:56.838
<v Josh Sparkes>well.
So just all the context of the firm</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6736-2
00:54:56.838 --> 00:55:02.580
<v Josh Sparkes>awareness that third party can also refer
to third parties that that invoices</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6736-3
00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.537
<v Josh Sparkes>they're just.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6773-0
00:55:03.777 --> 00:55:07.821
<v Josh Sparkes>We send bills to, yeah,
just there's no confusing for the user.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6773-1
00:55:07.821 --> 00:55:11.929
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I think. I mean,
I didn't want to just realise or simplify</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6773-2
00:55:11.929 --> 00:55:15.720
<v Josh Sparkes>money in money out,
but you're right to have third party in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6759-0
00:55:14.577 --> 00:55:14.857
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6773-3
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.817
<v Josh Sparkes>additional invoices.
Thank you also within that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6829-0
00:55:19.057 --> 00:55:22.460
<v Josh Sparkes>At only come lower level,
we're standardizing the terms vendor and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6829-1
00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:26.270
<v Josh Sparkes>contracting and things like that.
So I think it'd be good to once we get a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6829-2
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:29.216
<v Josh Sparkes>standardization on that if we get some
alignment on that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6829-3
00:55:29.216 --> 00:55:33.026
<v Josh Sparkes>So we want everybody's using them to mean
the same things because they use</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6829-4
00:55:33.026 --> 00:55:36.785
<v Josh Sparkes>interchangeably across the fund.
I think that's one of our challenging at</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6829-5
00:55:36.785 --> 00:55:38.817
<v Josh Sparkes>the beginning because I think Judge and.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6834-0
00:55:38.897 --> 00:55:42.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Onboarding or do we have a client's new
building on boarding? But thank you, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6857-0
00:55:45.937 --> 00:55:49.403
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
Let me see if we've got anything to close</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6857-1
00:55:49.403 --> 00:55:54.377
<v Josh Sparkes>out. So schedule requests,
we know that's a no, then we all have.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6918-0
00:55:56.577 --> 00:56:00.126
<v Josh Sparkes>I colluded that there might be some
conversations that go on,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6918-1
00:56:00.126 --> 00:56:04.877
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe you're not party to that like that
you know that you might be able to access</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6918-2
00:56:04.877 --> 00:56:08.999
<v Josh Sparkes>that you could schedule them.
You know that in this in this database or</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6883-0
00:56:07.337 --> 00:56:07.617
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6918-3
00:56:08.999 --> 00:56:12.319
<v Josh Sparkes>this repository,
we know loads of conversations have been</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6918-4
00:56:12.319 --> 00:56:16.097
<v Josh Sparkes>happening and you hear them maybe after
the event, but something.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6929-0
00:56:16.217 --> 00:56:19.598
<v Josh Sparkes>You go to the moment we capture that it
isn't a scheduled request,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6929-1
00:56:19.598 --> 00:56:23.232
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not a monthly activity.
You just get them ad hoc. Is that correct?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6929-2
00:56:23.232 --> 00:56:23.737
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6961-0
00:56:28.857 --> 00:56:33.193
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
Visibility on portal to be aligned on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6961-1
00:56:33.193 --> 00:56:39.491
<v Josh Sparkes>these groups here.
Do we miss anyone make the request? Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6961-2
00:56:39.491 --> 00:56:44.137
<v Josh Sparkes>that shows everybody happy with those,
yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6964-0
00:56:43.457 --> 00:56:46.817
<v Mark Sedgey>Josh, just be mindful if you can't see it.
Parex raised his hand.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6958-0
00:56:44.857 --> 00:56:45.057
<v Parik Narain>It.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/6966-0
00:56:47.017 --> 00:56:48.857
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh yeah, we can't see that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7021-0
00:56:49.457 --> 00:56:52.159
<v Parik Narain>Hey, hey, Josh. Sorry,
I was following the conversation.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7021-1
00:56:52.159 --> 00:56:54.908
<v Parik Narain>Just a question,
maybe maybe it's been covered 10 minutes</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7021-2
00:56:54.908 --> 00:56:58.084
<v Parik Narain>back, maybe I missed it.
But my point is when you are saying you'd</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7021-3
00:56:58.084 --> 00:57:01.687
<v Parik Narain>be on board a client for a billing,
I'm sure the client has already been on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7021-4
00:57:01.687 --> 00:57:04.057
<v Parik Narain>board because you have provided services
to them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7007-0
00:57:03.097 --> 00:57:03.257
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7021-5
00:57:04.057 --> 00:57:06.617
<v Parik Narain>So your lawyers have been providing
services to them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7059-0
00:57:06.817 --> 00:57:11.669
<v Parik Narain>Is there a list available in a CRM or
some other place which could be which</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7059-1
00:57:11.669 --> 00:57:16.905
<v Parik Narain>which you generally used to onboard the
same client on the e-billing system or is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7059-2
00:57:16.905 --> 00:57:21.056
<v Parik Narain>it the full process executed end to end
on the e-billing system?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7059-3
00:57:21.056 --> 00:57:24.057
<v Parik Narain>Because I'm I'm I'm just trying to figure
out.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7068-0
00:57:24.817 --> 00:57:30.177
<v Parik Narain>Where the client client information
exists in Ashurst as a separate platform.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7070-0
00:57:33.617 --> 00:57:34.977
<v Josh Sparkes>No worries.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7092-0
00:57:37.297 --> 00:57:42.513
<v Mark Sedgey>Yes, a parrot has. Sorry mate,
the bit that you possibly missed. Go on,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7076-0
00:57:37.337 --> 00:57:37.657
<v Josh Sparkes>So.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7089-0
00:57:38.897 --> 00:57:41.857
<v Josh Sparkes>I I only got. I only got.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7092-1
00:57:42.513 --> 00:57:43.817
<v Mark Sedgey>go on in the room.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7101-0
00:57:45.057 --> 00:57:51.017
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll defer to your knowledge, Mark.
You're far more better than me. Go for it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7152-0
00:57:52.617 --> 00:57:58.067
<v Mark Sedgey>So, so Perry, what what they were talking,
what the guys have were talking about is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7152-1
00:57:58.067 --> 00:58:02.090
<v Mark Sedgey>they've got a term system.
So where they're they initiate the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7152-2
00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:06.633
<v Mark Sedgey>agreements and what have you,
there is a system there but but the key</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7142-0
00:58:03.457 --> 00:58:04.617
<v Parik Narain>Got it. Got it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7152-3
00:58:06.633 --> 00:58:07.217
<v Mark Sedgey>point is.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7209-0
00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:12.407
<v Mark Sedgey>This about consistency of use,
effectiveness of use and things like that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7209-1
00:58:12.407 --> 00:58:17.327
<v Mark Sedgey>So for me there's there's, you know,
just my observations and listening and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7209-2
00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:20.370
<v Mark Sedgey>you're possibly coming to similar
conclusions.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7209-3
00:58:20.370 --> 00:58:25.678
<v Mark Sedgey>I suspect is that these guys are doing a
lot of activity because there isn't sort</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7189-0
00:58:21.817 --> 00:58:22.297
<v Parik Narain>Mm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7209-4
00:58:25.678 --> 00:58:27.297
<v Mark Sedgey>of the appropriate maybe.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7261-0
00:58:27.297 --> 00:58:30.095
<v Mark Sedgey>Controls upstream to ensure early
visibility.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7261-1
00:58:30.095 --> 00:58:32.954
<v Mark Sedgey>The right things are raised at the right
time,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7261-2
00:58:32.954 --> 00:58:37.091
<v Mark Sedgey>the right invoicing addresses are on a
system that can be utilized,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7238-0
00:58:35.697 --> 00:58:37.537
<v Parik Narain>Got it, got it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7261-3
00:58:37.091 --> 00:58:40.924
<v Mark Sedgey>therefore they haven't got to change.
Do you know what I mean?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7254-0
00:58:40.817 --> 00:58:42.137
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7261-4
00:58:40.924 --> 00:58:43.297
<v Mark Sedgey>So we want to as we're looking at this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7308-0
00:58:43.377 --> 00:58:48.548
<v Mark Sedgey>The I think as a collective we should be
thinking rather than us just responding</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7308-1
00:58:48.548 --> 00:58:52.252
<v Mark Sedgey>to, if you like,
the failure demand or the bits that need</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7308-2
00:58:52.252 --> 00:58:56.274
<v Mark Sedgey>to happen downstream.
What we need to be thinking in our minds</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7308-3
00:58:56.274 --> 00:58:59.658
<v Mark Sedgey>is what can we do?
It may not change what we deliver</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7308-4
00:58:59.658 --> 00:59:00.297
<v Mark Sedgey>initially.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7360-0
00:59:00.417 --> 00:59:05.337
<v Mark Sedgey>But what can we do and what can we think
about and what can we prepare for to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7360-1
00:59:05.337 --> 00:59:10.572
<v Mark Sedgey>enable us to put some controls in place.
So the failure demand of having to change</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7360-2
00:59:10.572 --> 00:59:13.600
<v Mark Sedgey>stuff or people requesting different,
you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7360-3
00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:18.772
<v Mark Sedgey>situations that we're responding to get
resolved and protected upfront and that's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7338-0
00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:14.577
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7360-4
00:59:18.772 --> 00:59:20.097
<v Mark Sedgey>kind of what I think.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7384-0
00:59:20.097 --> 00:59:23.646
<v Mark Sedgey>We're we're the the and the problem is
there's inconsistency.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7384-1
00:59:23.646 --> 00:59:27.539
<v Mark Sedgey>Is that fair in the room?
It's just inconsistence or or or just not</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7384-2
00:59:27.539 --> 00:59:29.657
<v Mark Sedgey>available for you guys to grab, Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7426-0
00:59:29.777 --> 00:59:35.311
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's probably timing in order.
Eventually everything goes into 3E</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7426-1
00:59:35.311 --> 00:59:40.846
<v Josh Sparkes>because you know, 3E will hold the client,
you know, the client contacts,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7426-2
00:59:40.846 --> 00:59:45.857
<v Josh Sparkes>the all the data that we need in order to
raise a bill. It's just.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7466-0
00:59:46.097 --> 00:59:52.738
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes elements of that process will
be slow and sometimes it will get fast</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7466-1
00:59:52.738 --> 00:59:58.455
<v Josh Sparkes>tracked in order to raise a bill.
We have a CRM system interaction,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7466-2
00:59:58.455 --> 01:00:00.137
<v Josh Sparkes>however interaction.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7470-0
00:59:59.297 --> 01:00:01.611
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, that's what I was after. The CRM,
correct.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7470-1
01:00:01.611 --> 01:00:03.737
<v Parik Narain>I was reasoning there would be a CRM
system.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7469-0
01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:03.097
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7517-0
01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:10.592
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, but we have two CRM systems,
one in Australia or two iterations,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7482-0
01:00:09.497 --> 01:00:09.577
<v Parik Narain>Oh.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7517-1
01:00:10.592 --> 01:00:18.001
<v Josh Sparkes>one in Australia and one rest of world.
One of the teams, data management team,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7492-0
01:00:14.617 --> 01:00:14.857
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7517-2
01:00:18.001 --> 01:00:22.817
<v Josh Sparkes>they keep the data In Sync between the
two systems.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7509-0
01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:22.697
<v Parik Narain>But.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7564-0
01:00:23.377 --> 01:00:29.276
<v Josh Sparkes>We are looking at that going forward,
but right now the quality of the data</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7564-1
01:00:29.276 --> 01:00:34.478
<v Josh Sparkes>that sits in our CRM system is
questionable because of we have two</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7564-2
01:00:34.478 --> 01:00:38.902
<v Josh Sparkes>versions etcetera.
So it's not the place where everybody</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7564-3
01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:43.017
<v Josh Sparkes>goes to parrot to say, oh,
what's happening on that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7558-0
01:00:42.217 --> 01:00:42.457
<v Parik Narain>Done.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7593-0
01:00:56.857 --> 01:00:57.097
<v Parik Narain>Right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7638-0
01:00:57.137 --> 01:01:01.141
<v Josh Sparkes>Do the conflicts,
checks and everything because every</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7595-0
01:00:57.737 --> 01:00:57.977
<v Parik Narain>Right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7638-1
01:01:01.141 --> 01:01:05.812
<v Josh Sparkes>client has to have a conflict check
before we can do business.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7620-0
01:01:04.257 --> 01:01:06.777
<v Parik Narain>Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7638-2
01:01:05.812 --> 01:01:10.706
<v Josh Sparkes>Can't remember what the name of the
system is. It's Intap, Intap.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7638-3
01:01:10.706 --> 01:01:12.857
<v Josh Sparkes>So everything goes via Intap.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7631-0
01:01:11.057 --> 01:01:11.337
<v Parik Narain>Yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7654-0
01:01:14.097 --> 01:01:16.458
<v Parik Narain>Got it. Got it.
So dermatool systems in play.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7654-1
01:01:16.458 --> 01:01:20.257
<v Parik Narain>We'll find out in the background what
works best. That's fine. Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7649-0
01:01:16.497 --> 01:01:18.217
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, you test to me. I don't know.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7714-0
01:01:19.537 --> 01:01:22.331
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
I suppose that that concludes that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7714-1
01:01:22.331 --> 01:01:27.777
<v Josh Sparkes>somebody knew something before you
essentially that's what we're landing is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7714-2
01:01:27.777 --> 01:01:33.294
<v Josh Sparkes>that if only they had told us what they
knew two weeks ago, three weeks ago,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7714-3
01:01:33.294 --> 01:01:39.457
<v Josh Sparkes>four weeks ago, rather than I need it now.
So I think that's probably concluded that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7730-0
01:01:39.457 --> 01:01:46.287
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's getting that what they knew to
you quickly so you can be ahead of that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7730-1
01:01:46.287 --> 01:01:48.337
<v Josh Sparkes>curve on your processes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7769-0
01:01:49.537 --> 01:01:53.771
<v Josh Sparkes>On the the exchange piece,
I think one thing we need to be doing as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7769-1
01:01:53.771 --> 01:01:58.816
<v Josh Sparkes>part of this is to understand where the
best source is and do we have one that's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7769-2
01:01:58.816 --> 01:02:03.736
<v Josh Sparkes>of a suitable quality to pull it in and
obviously from an integration point of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7769-3
01:02:03.736 --> 01:02:04.857
<v Josh Sparkes>view we'll target.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7810-0
01:02:05.057 --> 01:02:07.606
<v Josh Sparkes>Those that's got a good data sources
first.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7810-1
01:02:07.606 --> 01:02:11.950
<v Josh Sparkes>We have got an EDP project which was
running and that will be pulling data</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7810-2
01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:16.585
<v Josh Sparkes>from such as E3 and whatever else and
there might be other platforms that would</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7810-3
01:02:16.585 --> 01:02:20.177
<v Josh Sparkes>be sensible to consider pulling in
subsets of data into that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7838-0
01:02:21.177 --> 01:02:24.754
<v Josh Sparkes>However, that whole, you know,
data structure piece,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7838-1
01:02:24.754 --> 01:02:29.748
<v Josh Sparkes>I know we touched on it last week,
Julian as well. For every integration,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7838-2
01:02:29.748 --> 01:02:34.337
<v Josh Sparkes>we need to make sure that we're taking a
a solid source. Yeah, but.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7878-0
01:02:35.297 --> 01:02:39.822
<v Josh Sparkes>I think part of that long checklist that
we had at the beginning,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7878-1
01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:42.908
<v Josh Sparkes>it was that entry dependency entry
triggers.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7878-2
01:02:42.908 --> 01:02:46.474
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you've captured that very well.
Yeah, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7878-3
01:02:46.474 --> 01:02:51.000
<v Josh Sparkes>some things there to take away.
So you can actually capture those</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7878-4
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.017
<v Josh Sparkes>different. Yeah,
anybody might if you come.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7928-0
01:02:54.417 --> 01:02:57.101
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, cool.
Just while we're on the visibility on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7928-1
01:02:57.101 --> 01:03:00.904
<v Josh Sparkes>portal and who can raise,
is it a fair assumption that we could say</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7928-2
01:03:00.904 --> 01:03:05.490
<v Josh Sparkes>that everybody in the e-billing team can
raise all e-billing requests on the back</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7928-3
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:08.511
<v Josh Sparkes>end? Yeah, well,
I think the back end is interesting.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7928-4
01:03:08.511 --> 01:03:13.097
<v Josh Sparkes>We also thought modelling good behaviour.
Maybe you'll go through the front door.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7973-0
01:03:14.417 --> 01:03:18.061
<v Josh Sparkes>Of things as well,
but you know you have access to be at the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7973-1
01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:21.526
<v Josh Sparkes>back end as well,
but just that modelling so you know the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7973-2
01:03:21.526 --> 01:03:26.067
<v Josh Sparkes>experience for your requester as well.
Obviously you'll be in the back end,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7973-3
01:03:26.067 --> 01:03:30.249
<v Josh Sparkes>but maybe good behaviours that you
equally go through the front door,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7973-4
01:03:30.249 --> 01:03:33.057
<v Josh Sparkes>but there's an e-bidding team you can do
that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/7980-0
01:03:33.297 --> 01:03:38.017
<v Josh Sparkes>As a requester and a double hat as an
agent.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8018-0
01:03:39.457 --> 01:03:44.251
<v Josh Sparkes>What do we want to capture that as a
requirement that we want to be able to do</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8018-1
01:03:44.251 --> 01:03:46.921
<v Josh Sparkes>that?
I don't think I've included different</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8018-2
01:03:46.921 --> 01:03:51.047
<v Josh Sparkes>visibility on the portal.
I haven't done that back end piece. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8018-3
01:03:51.047 --> 01:03:55.417
<v Josh Sparkes>I would be equally the requester and the
agent, you know, so you might.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8061-0
01:03:56.657 --> 01:03:59.403
<v Josh Sparkes>To be doing it,
even though it hasn't come in as a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8061-1
01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:01.934
<v Josh Sparkes>request,
you know that you're having to do it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8061-2
01:04:01.934 --> 01:04:05.488
<v Josh Sparkes>So you're both the requester and the
fulfiller essentially. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8061-3
01:04:05.488 --> 01:04:09.419
<v Josh Sparkes>I was wondering whether we just assumed
that the team could on everyone,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8061-4
01:04:09.419 --> 01:04:13.297
<v Josh Sparkes>but but but we can't call it out because
there might be an opportunity.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8105-0
01:04:13.457 --> 01:04:17.380
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, you probably,
there was some probably financial</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8105-1
01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:22.757
<v Josh Sparkes>processes where you don't want to be
marking your own homework, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8105-2
01:04:22.757 --> 01:04:26.099
<v Josh Sparkes>for and then the segregation of duty of
that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8105-3
01:04:26.099 --> 01:04:32.057
<v Josh Sparkes>But before requesting that a client is on
boarded, you're capturing that because.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8119-0
01:04:32.417 --> 01:04:36.194
<v Josh Sparkes>To add to the count of the activity or
the reporting of it. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8119-1
01:04:36.194 --> 01:04:39.617
<v Josh Sparkes>but I'll make a note of that. Thanks Tim.
Thank you, Tim.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8133-0
01:04:40.857 --> 01:04:45.030
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, Deborah,
I know we've got some suggestions here on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8133-1
01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:46.017
<v Josh Sparkes>data capture.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8138-0
01:04:47.577 --> 01:04:50.537
<v Josh Sparkes>For to to kick this off.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8170-0
01:04:51.617 --> 01:04:57.888
<v Josh Sparkes>You may want to include that you capture
or I think there was a conversation on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8170-1
01:04:57.888 --> 01:05:03.924
<v Josh Sparkes>the probably on that scenario was it
needs to be paid. Could you just do it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8170-2
01:05:03.924 --> 01:05:07.217
<v Josh Sparkes>Could you just onboard and could you just?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8226-0
01:05:07.297 --> 01:05:12.623
<v Josh Sparkes>But the good behaviour it's capturing,
even though there might be this sort of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8226-1
01:05:12.623 --> 01:05:16.600
<v Josh Sparkes>subset of fields,
they're still adding value to reporting,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8226-2
01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.971
<v Josh Sparkes>etcetera.
So I'd capture some here parent company</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8226-3
01:05:19.971 --> 01:05:24.083
<v Josh Sparkes>known by any other names,
maybe they are known by, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8226-4
01:05:24.083 --> 01:05:25.297
<v Josh Sparkes>you refer to them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8266-0
01:05:26.497 --> 01:05:31.108
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, maybe it's a really long name,
but actually internally you just refer to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8266-1
01:05:31.108 --> 01:05:33.774
<v Josh Sparkes>younger sex,
but equally they might be known as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8266-2
01:05:33.774 --> 01:05:37.608
<v Josh Sparkes>another name externally as well.
So I put some recommendations here,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8266-3
01:05:37.608 --> 01:05:40.052
<v Josh Sparkes>right to work in this country or
sanctions.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8266-4
01:05:40.052 --> 01:05:43.497
<v Josh Sparkes>I know in the last couple of years
sanctions have come a lot.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8295-0
01:05:43.777 --> 01:05:48.654
<v Josh Sparkes>Come up a lot for different legal
entities in different countries,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8295-1
01:05:48.654 --> 01:05:53.386
<v Josh Sparkes>but I feel free. I mean,
there may be ones that you also say are</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8295-2
01:05:53.386 --> 01:05:55.497
<v Josh Sparkes>very paramount that you need.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8318-0
01:05:56.257 --> 01:05:58.755
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Do those trigger any?
And they're not,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8318-1
01:05:58.755 --> 01:06:01.531
<v Josh Sparkes>but they're conversational pieces that
you today.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8318-2
01:06:01.531 --> 01:06:05.417
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you were to go on to do it,
there's some recommendations there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8354-0
01:06:09.337 --> 01:06:11.811
<v Josh Sparkes>Hello.
Is the trigger just for like you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8354-1
01:06:11.811 --> 01:06:15.523
<v Josh Sparkes>mentioned sanctions,
but what about like regulation change?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8354-2
01:06:15.523 --> 01:06:18.369
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
all of so it automatically triggers and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8354-3
01:06:18.369 --> 01:06:23.257
<v Josh Sparkes>then it can tell you your billing is
changing or does somebody have to go and?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8396-0
01:06:23.537 --> 01:06:27.419
<v Josh Sparkes>From the e-billing,
if I've got the fields on the form,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8396-1
01:06:27.419 --> 01:06:32.203
<v Josh Sparkes>you're saying that there's a regular
regulatory change like IFRS 18,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8396-2
01:06:32.203 --> 01:06:37.819
<v Josh Sparkes>for instance, yes. So it could capture,
you know, that sort of request to check.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8396-3
01:06:37.819 --> 01:06:40.177
<v Josh Sparkes>So client onboarding could be new.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8425-0
01:06:40.257 --> 01:06:44.433
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean probably we're probably discussing
new here at this point,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8425-1
01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:49.242
<v Josh Sparkes>but there is that sort of when it comes
to admin, there are those requests,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8425-2
01:06:49.242 --> 01:06:54.177
<v Josh Sparkes>you know additional changes to that.
So there are talking into functions that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8425-3
01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:54.937
<v Josh Sparkes>can be done.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8464-0
01:06:55.297 --> 01:06:58.272
<v Josh Sparkes>By the compliance,
risk and compliance statement matter</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8464-1
01:06:58.272 --> 01:07:00.503
<v Josh Sparkes>creation,
then we wouldn't be involved in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8464-2
01:07:00.503 --> 01:07:03.319
<v Josh Sparkes>everything regulatory,
compliantory sanctions. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8464-3
01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:07.515
<v Josh Sparkes>that would all be done in NBIS and new
business intake. That wouldn't be done.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8464-4
01:07:07.515 --> 01:07:10.544
<v Josh Sparkes>That's cleared.
We would assume everything's cleared and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8464-5
01:07:10.544 --> 01:07:12.297
<v Josh Sparkes>we can proceed with our boarding.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8505-0
01:07:12.577 --> 01:07:16.189
<v Josh Sparkes>Right.
So the so the name only that you get is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8505-1
01:07:16.189 --> 01:07:20.724
<v Josh Sparkes>company name, legal company,
all that's been done as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8505-2
01:07:20.724 --> 01:07:25.489
<v Josh Sparkes>And what other information then do you
need to like the yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8505-3
01:07:25.489 --> 01:07:31.177
<v Josh Sparkes>the portal that they're going to. Yeah,
portal name, yeah, name and date.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8537-0
01:07:31.857 --> 01:07:37.723
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it from effective from when they send
it over, not backdated? No, we don't.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8537-1
01:07:37.723 --> 01:07:41.881
<v Josh Sparkes>Doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Lauren,
can I check?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8537-2
01:07:41.881 --> 01:07:46.857
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you have a forum once you know a
client and you bill and claim?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8547-0
01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:53.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you have a forum that you ask the PES
or somebody to complete?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8590-0
01:07:54.497 --> 01:07:58.419
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah,
I think that's what you're alluding to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8590-1
01:07:58.419 --> 01:08:05.121
<v Josh Sparkes>now here to to remove that because as you
said you're assuming that 1-2 and three</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8590-2
01:08:05.121 --> 01:08:11.577
<v Josh Sparkes>have done that's inferred approval and
actually if we could capture that it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8621-0
01:08:11.617 --> 01:08:16.900
<v Josh Sparkes>As your checklist, as you say,
that becomes an official check for an</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8621-1
01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:22.796
<v Josh Sparkes>audit trail for if you have to go back
and and it's supporting evidence that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8621-2
01:08:22.796 --> 01:08:27.697
<v Josh Sparkes>those checks have been done.
So anything that you have on that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8643-0
01:08:28.737 --> 01:08:35.882
<v Josh Sparkes>A contact that we can reach out to and
that's name, phone and yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8643-1
01:08:35.882 --> 01:08:41.137
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail provided. So you know,
contact the client.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8669-0
01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:48.657
<v Josh Sparkes>Be if we have an OCG outside council
guidelines or building requirements.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8669-1
01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:55.066
<v Josh Sparkes>So we need that to know how we can
deliver and to know what rates have been</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8669-2
01:08:55.066 --> 01:08:55.657
<v Josh Sparkes>agreed.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8717-0
01:08:57.177 --> 01:09:01.547
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that the details of the rates or the
fact that rates have been agreed?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8717-1
01:09:01.547 --> 01:09:05.918
<v Josh Sparkes>Are we doing, is it a panel agreement?
Is it are we doing the things that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8717-2
01:09:05.918 --> 01:09:09.048
<v Josh Sparkes>standards,
whatever has been applied because we need</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8717-3
01:09:09.048 --> 01:09:12.297
<v Josh Sparkes>to put those into the portal,
so we need to know what?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8746-0
01:09:12.577 --> 01:09:16.603
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
And so is that likes to work on drop down</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8746-1
01:09:16.603 --> 01:09:23.649
<v Josh Sparkes>list rather than free text so that if you
put 15% or you have a specific group that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8746-2
01:09:23.649 --> 01:09:26.417
<v Josh Sparkes>you have on those free dates, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8748-0
01:09:29.097 --> 01:09:31.817
<v Josh Sparkes>I was there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8786-0
01:09:33.217 --> 01:09:37.043
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that is everything.
Have you got a copy of the form, Lauren?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8786-1
01:09:37.043 --> 01:09:41.480
<v Josh Sparkes>You can just here follow up with us? Yes.
OK, yeah, that's easy. Just for that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8786-2
01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:44.086
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I have a couple of questions.
I correct.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8786-3
01:09:44.086 --> 01:09:47.802
<v Josh Sparkes>I have a payment this is that we
constantly don't get information,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8786-4
01:09:47.802 --> 01:09:49.577
<v Josh Sparkes>so we have to go back and forth.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8831-0
01:09:49.937 --> 01:09:54.025
<v Josh Sparkes>Try and pull into the exact information
out so if we get it, we get it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8831-1
01:09:54.025 --> 01:09:56.580
<v Josh Sparkes>So that will say this client is on
boarding,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8831-2
01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:59.079
<v Josh Sparkes>needs to be on boarded and that will be
it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8831-3
01:09:59.079 --> 01:10:01.577
<v Josh Sparkes>They won't give us any of this
information,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8831-4
01:10:01.577 --> 01:10:06.063
<v Josh Sparkes>so we need to go back and then you have
to go and fill out the form correctly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8831-5
01:10:06.063 --> 01:10:09.697
<v Josh Sparkes>They don't give us everything,
so we have to go back again and.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8878-0
01:10:09.777 --> 01:10:14.286
<v Josh Sparkes>You're like, here's an ambush, it's like,
hang on, we need to onboard this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8878-1
01:10:14.286 --> 01:10:18.855
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's a lot of back and forth.
So this was dead and that's totally what</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8878-2
01:10:18.855 --> 01:10:23.542
<v Josh Sparkes>we're trying to do here in the whole part
of the enterprise service management</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8878-3
01:10:23.542 --> 01:10:28.408
<v Josh Sparkes>program is that the focus from a change
management perspective will be to use the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8878-4
01:10:28.408 --> 01:10:29.417
<v Josh Sparkes>forms on service.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8923-0
01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:34.464
<v Josh Sparkes>Now, rather than emailing, you know,
that's not going to be a straightforward</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8923-1
01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:38.625
<v Josh Sparkes>change for certain groups of people,
but that is the approach that we're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8923-2
01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:41.476
<v Josh Sparkes>taking.
So this is somewhere we should put effort</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8923-3
01:10:41.476 --> 01:10:44.897
<v Josh Sparkes>in to capture what we yeah,
I've said that we could be for.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8961-0
01:10:45.137 --> 01:10:50.205
<v Josh Sparkes>Lots of quotes are that their seniority
or their is modelling good behaviour</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8961-1
01:10:50.205 --> 01:10:55.405
<v Josh Sparkes>throughout the whole of that ashes from
the top down and these fields would be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8961-2
01:10:55.405 --> 01:11:00.737
<v Josh Sparkes>you know when you send an e-mail you're
just typing and you're getting and then.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8993-0
01:11:01.537 --> 01:11:05.561
<v Josh Sparkes>Just pressing send,
but these forms are guided so that you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8993-1
01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:10.472
<v Josh Sparkes>get as much information for you upfront
from the persons requesting it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8993-2
01:11:10.472 --> 01:11:15.996
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there anything that causes you that
prevents you retrospectively having to go</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/8993-3
01:11:15.996 --> 01:11:17.497
<v Josh Sparkes>back, check, get this?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9027-0
01:11:17.577 --> 01:11:21.783
<v Josh Sparkes>Or means more portal admin or whatever is
downstream.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9027-1
01:11:21.783 --> 01:11:27.935
<v Josh Sparkes>This form is a great entry point to
capture that. OK, that's good stuff. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9027-2
01:11:27.935 --> 01:11:33.387
<v Josh Sparkes>looking at team it lands with.
So back to the the point earlier about</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9027-3
01:11:33.387 --> 01:11:35.257
<v Josh Sparkes>can we can we globalize?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9081-0
01:11:37.297 --> 01:11:42.233
<v Josh Sparkes>So I mean is it, it could be that that.
So that form that you're talking about</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9081-1
01:11:42.233 --> 01:11:46.295
<v Josh Sparkes>those checks because legal and compliance
have done the legwork,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9081-2
01:11:46.295 --> 01:11:51.107
<v Josh Sparkes>is it something that can be globalised?
I mean the fact that maybe it's been</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9081-3
01:11:51.107 --> 01:11:54.857
<v Josh Sparkes>requested in one country,
there is that logic that says OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9117-0
01:11:54.937 --> 01:11:58.138
<v Josh Sparkes>That request is in this group,
in this domain,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9117-1
01:11:58.138 --> 01:12:02.497
<v Josh Sparkes>therefore it goes to the UK or Australia
or an e-billing group.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9117-2
01:12:02.497 --> 01:12:07.946
<v Josh Sparkes>But is there something that you would
prefer that it is just a assignment group</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9117-3
01:12:07.946 --> 01:12:09.377
<v Josh Sparkes>that's e-billing all?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9145-0
01:12:09.977 --> 01:12:13.525
<v Josh Sparkes>Particularly,
I think was it Lynn yourself that said</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9145-1
01:12:13.525 --> 01:12:17.476
<v Josh Sparkes>globalised clients,
you know there's those that need to be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9145-2
01:12:17.476 --> 01:12:20.891
<v Josh Sparkes>processed.
I think this could be globalised at the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9145-3
01:12:20.891 --> 01:12:22.297
<v Josh Sparkes>moment we're working.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9178-0
01:12:23.657 --> 01:12:26.591
<v Josh Sparkes>Well, I follow the sun,
so anything in Asia,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9178-1
01:12:26.591 --> 01:12:30.048
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not sure you have a handle on the
Brisbane team,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9178-2
01:12:30.048 --> 01:12:34.026
<v Josh Sparkes>at least the US is handed by Glasgow.
Yeah, that's this way.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9178-3
01:12:34.026 --> 01:12:38.657
<v Josh Sparkes>But there is a lot of crossovers with it.
Onboarding is onboarding it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9213-0
01:12:39.457 --> 01:12:43.268
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the same,
but it it depends more about the client,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9213-1
01:12:43.268 --> 01:12:47.079
<v Josh Sparkes>about the portal.
It can follow different paths through</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9213-2
01:12:47.079 --> 01:12:50.209
<v Josh Sparkes>that,
but how it comes in to us is a request.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9213-3
01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:54.088
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's good.
And on your dashboards it could be that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9213-4
01:12:54.088 --> 01:12:55.177
<v Josh Sparkes>the on the form.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9265-0
01:12:55.657 --> 01:13:00.622
<v Josh Sparkes>The location is picked up or confused or
however and on your dashboards you can</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9265-1
01:13:00.622 --> 01:13:03.725
<v Josh Sparkes>say OK,
it's been segregated for this side of the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9265-2
01:13:03.725 --> 01:13:06.642
<v Josh Sparkes>earth or this side behind northern
hemisphere,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9265-3
01:13:06.642 --> 01:13:11.297
<v Josh Sparkes>southern hemisphere and you can get that
detail so that you can go in and.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9287-0
01:13:11.737 --> 01:13:14.346
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
maybe in the UK you're handling these</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9287-1
01:13:14.346 --> 01:13:16.575
<v Josh Sparkes>ones,
but certainly it could be a global</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9287-2
01:13:16.575 --> 01:13:19.457
<v Josh Sparkes>process, but um,
split on the national eye activity.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9334-0
01:13:17.097 --> 01:13:22.017
<v Mark Sedgey>If if it helps, if it helps,
it might be worth thinking from you know</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9334-1
01:13:22.017 --> 01:13:27.640
<v Mark Sedgey>if you think about a form coming in and
having like a level 1 triage type team,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9334-2
01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:32.770
<v Mark Sedgey>you make sure the data is there,
you know they recognise where it is and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9334-3
01:13:32.770 --> 01:13:36.777
<v Mark Sedgey>what have you and then have the the
ability to route to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9390-0
01:13:37.097 --> 01:13:41.126
<v Mark Sedgey>The appropriate resolver team or you
could do it from certain fields,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9390-1
01:13:41.126 --> 01:13:45.788
<v Mark Sedgey>certain rules and then they route to the
resolver team and then if it isn't that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9390-2
01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:50.220
<v Mark Sedgey>resolver team or they can't operate,
then at least the other teams will have</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9390-3
01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:54.594
<v Mark Sedgey>visibility of it and can pick it up.
So this is one about how you structure</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9390-4
01:13:54.594 --> 01:13:56.897
<v Mark Sedgey>your organization to enable you want to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9443-0
01:13:57.097 --> 01:14:01.877
<v Mark Sedgey>Make sure what you're getting in the form
is correct and concise and all the fields</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9443-1
01:14:01.877 --> 01:14:04.552
<v Mark Sedgey>appropriately order data provided for
example.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9443-2
01:14:04.552 --> 01:14:08.365
<v Mark Sedgey>And then how do you route that to the
best person to then resolve.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9443-3
01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:12.918
<v Mark Sedgey>So that might be just something as we go
through this is to keep in the back of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9443-4
01:14:12.918 --> 01:14:16.617
<v Mark Sedgey>your mind what what could you do
organizationally to enable you?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9464-0
01:14:16.617 --> 01:14:21.184
<v Mark Sedgey>To operate a really, you know,
a sort of greater control of, if you like,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9464-1
01:14:21.184 --> 01:14:25.997
<v Mark Sedgey>what comes in the door and then the
greater control in terms of where it gets</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9464-2
01:14:25.997 --> 01:14:27.417
<v Mark Sedgey>routed. Does that help?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9467-0
01:14:26.537 --> 01:14:30.417
<v Josh Sparkes>And can can how many people are in the UK?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9479-0
01:14:31.817 --> 01:14:39.817
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've got a team of 10 globally, Mark.
Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9477-0
01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:36.337
<v Mark Sedgey>Right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9509-0
01:14:40.697 --> 01:14:46.474
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So it's not massive amounts.
So yeah, in terms,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9512-0
01:14:44.777 --> 01:14:50.278
<v Mark Sedgey>OK. So, so, so the,
so the initial triage team is go on,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9509-1
01:14:46.474 --> 01:14:49.577
<v Josh Sparkes>but we could still delineate.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9512-1
01:14:50.278 --> 01:14:50.857
<v Mark Sedgey>sorry.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9555-0
01:14:51.017 --> 01:14:56.936
<v Josh Sparkes>We can still delineate responsibilities,
but I think it's going to be, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9555-1
01:14:56.936 --> 01:15:01.979
<v Josh Sparkes>individuals more than, yeah,
it's slightly different from networking</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9530-0
01:14:58.137 --> 01:15:00.017
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, gotcha.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9555-2
01:15:01.979 --> 01:15:05.779
<v Josh Sparkes>or network issues on that.
Robbie Mark of triaging,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9555-3
01:15:05.779 --> 01:15:08.337
<v Josh Sparkes>it sounds more like that requester.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9601-0
01:15:08.617 --> 01:15:12.108
<v Josh Sparkes>Does a lot of the input upfront,
which is your validation,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9601-1
01:15:12.108 --> 01:15:14.889
<v Josh Sparkes>you know that they're not,
it's not free text.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9601-2
01:15:14.889 --> 01:15:19.149
<v Josh Sparkes>You're going to use drop downs.
You're getting that once we have a look</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9601-3
01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:23.587
<v Josh Sparkes>at that form that will fall out.
So then when it's landed with yourselves,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9601-4
01:15:23.587 --> 01:15:24.297
<v Josh Sparkes>it's on 90%.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9621-0
01:15:24.377 --> 01:15:27.065
<v Josh Sparkes>Checked anyway, and Mark,
to add to your point,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9621-1
01:15:27.065 --> 01:15:31.657
<v Josh Sparkes>that sort of segregation can come on the
intelligence of the input from the form.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9665-0
01:15:31.097 --> 01:15:34.756
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, exactly. Yes. So, so, yeah,
totally get that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9665-1
01:15:34.756 --> 01:15:39.472
<v Mark Sedgey>So level one's irrelevant,
but the smart gathering of data to root</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9634-0
01:15:36.297 --> 01:15:36.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9665-2
01:15:39.472 --> 01:15:43.976
<v Mark Sedgey>is the key. You know,
it would be the objective that we aim for</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9665-3
01:15:43.976 --> 01:15:46.017
<v Mark Sedgey>to get it to the right teams.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9701-0
01:15:46.057 --> 01:15:49.636
<v Josh Sparkes>That would help a lot about I misspent
triage and tickets.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9701-1
01:15:49.636 --> 01:15:53.882
<v Josh Sparkes>So with the onboarding we have two people
that manage the bulk of it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9701-2
01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:58.554
<v Josh Sparkes>So one person in Glasgow and one person
in Brisbane would be ideal where the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9701-3
01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:02.254
<v Josh Sparkes>requestor comes in.
It then goes to those individual queues,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9701-4
01:16:02.254 --> 01:16:02.497
<v Josh Sparkes>yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9742-0
01:16:03.137 --> 01:16:08.274
<v Josh Sparkes>And that could be also assigned. Yeah.
And if they're unavailable, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9742-1
01:16:08.274 --> 01:16:13.678
<v Josh Sparkes>equally it could be reassigned too as
well. So that that that identity is there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9742-2
01:16:13.678 --> 01:16:18.215
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. So that's good group wise,
just so I capture it, right. I mean,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9742-3
01:16:18.215 --> 01:16:20.017
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll say it's conditional.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9754-0
01:16:20.297 --> 01:16:24.481
<v Josh Sparkes>Then we will write the workflow obviously
in the the back end,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9754-1
01:16:24.481 --> 01:16:27.537
<v Josh Sparkes>but once we record team wise we're going
for.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9792-0
01:16:30.057 --> 01:16:35.805
<v Josh Sparkes>Conditional routing, if you've got it,
but essentially you've got that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9792-1
01:16:35.805 --> 01:16:42.271
<v Josh Sparkes>I suppose the only question was that the
global clients that could just be we'll</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9792-2
01:16:42.271 --> 01:16:49.057
<v Josh Sparkes>talk about how they know maybe that's all
the skill metrics that global clients get.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9795-0
01:16:50.337 --> 01:16:54.217
<v Josh Sparkes>Rooted. Is that a relief?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9833-0
01:16:55.097 --> 01:16:58.521
<v Josh Sparkes>Right. OK.
So that's a that's a you know condition</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9833-1
01:16:58.521 --> 01:17:03.691
<v Josh Sparkes>that we can have in the form that if
global handled by Glasgow and it can be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9833-2
01:17:03.691 --> 01:17:08.794
<v Josh Sparkes>reassigned if that's if you need to,
but I but I am hearing we still need a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9833-3
01:17:08.794 --> 01:17:10.137
<v Josh Sparkes>delineation between.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9837-0
01:17:11.097 --> 01:17:13.017
<v Josh Sparkes>Let's go. Yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9843-0
01:17:13.897 --> 01:17:15.577
<v Josh Sparkes>But one form that we've had, yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9849-0
01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:21.977
<v Josh Sparkes>It'd be cool if it was the Oz.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9852-0
01:17:23.857 --> 01:17:25.457
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, I think it is, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9874-0
01:17:26.537 --> 01:17:30.067
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, all clear. That's good conversation.
Country specificity,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9874-1
01:17:30.067 --> 01:17:34.452
<v Josh Sparkes>that's kind of what we just mentioned
there. One form country specific data,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9874-2
01:17:34.452 --> 01:17:34.737
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9930-0
01:17:38.937 --> 01:17:42.632
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Next in the flow, try to do this.
So it's the process that you do.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9930-1
01:17:42.632 --> 01:17:45.964
<v Josh Sparkes>So you see the form in the portal here,
the fields you fill in,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9930-2
01:17:45.964 --> 01:17:49.139
<v Josh Sparkes>who's who it goes to.
That's the that's what we're trying to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9930-3
01:17:49.139 --> 01:17:52.679
<v Josh Sparkes>copy here. Other information. Yeah,
you've got some here different.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9930-4
01:17:52.679 --> 01:17:54.657
<v Josh Sparkes>We answered it well in the sense that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9970-0
01:17:55.417 --> 01:18:00.234
<v Josh Sparkes>The legal matters, the regulatory,
the compliance is all done for you,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9970-1
01:18:00.234 --> 01:18:05.729
<v Josh Sparkes>but once you I believe probably feel that
I put here are probably not applicable</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9970-2
01:18:05.729 --> 01:18:09.935
<v Josh Sparkes>now having done that,
but it's certainly I hear that actually</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/9970-3
01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:14.617
<v Josh Sparkes>after the requester has done it,
you then enter information such as.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10018-0
01:18:15.337 --> 01:18:19.979
<v Josh Sparkes>E portal name. Is it names?
Is it it just goes on one?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10018-1
01:18:19.979 --> 01:18:24.284
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there one to one?
So each client has their own.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10018-2
01:18:24.284 --> 01:18:28.926
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that correct?
Can I see that there were 59 portals?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10018-3
01:18:28.926 --> 01:18:33.062
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that correct? Yeah,
but within those portals,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10018-4
01:18:33.062 --> 01:18:35.257
<v Josh Sparkes>there's 80 clients listed.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10074-0
01:18:35.337 --> 01:18:39.350
<v Josh Sparkes>What's that called? Sorry, Legal Tracker.
Legal Tracker has 18 in there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10074-1
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:42.263
<v Josh Sparkes>There's another portion that's got 15,
some of them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10074-2
01:18:42.263 --> 01:18:46.386
<v Josh Sparkes>There's another portal to counsel link
that has I think about 12 on there,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10074-3
01:18:46.386 --> 01:18:50.619
<v Josh Sparkes>but then there's one client in Bank of
America have their own version of it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10074-4
01:18:50.619 --> 01:18:53.313
<v Josh Sparkes>which is in a separate link.
So it's one-to-one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10074-5
01:18:53.313 --> 01:18:55.017
<v Josh Sparkes>So you enter one client or one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10110-0
01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:59.712
<v Josh Sparkes>Portal. No, no.
There's multiple clients within portals.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10110-1
01:18:59.712 --> 01:19:06.514
<v Josh Sparkes>It depends on the client if they're paid
for their own specific one. OK, right. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10110-2
01:19:06.514 --> 01:19:11.777
<v Josh Sparkes>so if they want their own exclusivity,
can you put them on once?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10157-0
01:19:12.377 --> 01:19:15.773
<v Josh Sparkes>Already existing logins.
So most of the time if we're on boarding,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10157-1
01:19:15.773 --> 01:19:18.966
<v Josh Sparkes>say for leading tracker,
a new client that will just go on our</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10157-2
01:19:18.966 --> 01:19:23.123
<v Josh Sparkes>existing login that we've already got and
it's already got all of our information</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10157-3
01:19:23.123 --> 01:19:25.556
<v Josh Sparkes>in there.
So they literally just press that and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10157-4
01:19:25.556 --> 01:19:27.888
<v Josh Sparkes>look at us up.
We don't all in these portals.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10157-5
01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:30.017
<v Josh Sparkes>These are third party portals. Yeah, that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10198-0
01:19:30.577 --> 01:19:35.936
<v Josh Sparkes>Some other software vendor is selling to
the clients to help them and let's be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10198-1
01:19:35.936 --> 01:19:40.685
<v Josh Sparkes>honest, reduce their legal fees.
That's the purpose of these portals.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10198-2
01:19:40.685 --> 01:19:43.941
<v Josh Sparkes>So they will track and they will reject
things.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10198-3
01:19:43.941 --> 01:19:49.097
<v Josh Sparkes>Just to give you a bit of perspective if
for instance I do not pay any any.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10239-0
01:19:49.977 --> 01:19:56.149
<v Josh Sparkes>Any time for research so the the portal
will scour anything that says research</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10239-1
01:19:56.149 --> 01:20:02.478
<v Josh Sparkes>and automatically reject the bill or I
don't accept anything with a comma or any</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10239-2
01:20:02.478 --> 01:20:05.057
<v Josh Sparkes>grammatic in it bill rejected so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10293-0
01:20:06.297 --> 01:20:11.521
<v Josh Sparkes>We're not in control of the portals they
use and we just have to use that as a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10293-1
01:20:11.521 --> 01:20:17.142
<v Josh Sparkes>vehicle by which we upload the bill. Yeah,
but you want to capture where that client</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10293-2
01:20:17.142 --> 01:20:21.969
<v Josh Sparkes>has been on boarded to essentially.
So that that's probably a good bill.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10293-3
01:20:21.969 --> 01:20:25.937
<v Josh Sparkes>So I can take out those little things
that you're entering.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10334-0
01:20:26.137 --> 01:20:30.324
<v Josh Sparkes>And post requests could be portals that
it's been on boarding to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10334-1
01:20:30.324 --> 01:20:33.115
<v Josh Sparkes>You might do accounts associated with
that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10334-2
01:20:33.115 --> 01:20:35.970
<v Josh Sparkes>but you can see they've been added on
three.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10334-3
01:20:35.970 --> 01:20:40.982
<v Josh Sparkes>So presumably if you needed to or we will
get to it when you have your invoice</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10334-4
01:20:40.982 --> 01:20:41.617
<v Josh Sparkes>rejection.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10376-0
01:20:42.137 --> 01:20:44.806
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
I don't want to jump ahead particularly,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10376-1
01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:48.781
<v Josh Sparkes>but does the invoice go on?
It only goes on one though in the future,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10376-2
01:20:48.781 --> 01:20:51.621
<v Josh Sparkes>does it?
You would only upload an invoice to that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10376-3
01:20:51.621 --> 01:20:56.107
<v Josh Sparkes>point, but if the client's on multiple,
you add multiple or you just add it to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10376-4
01:20:56.107 --> 01:21:00.196
<v Josh Sparkes>one, just to one, just to one.
The client will only go into one or two,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10376-5
01:21:00.196 --> 01:21:00.537
<v Josh Sparkes>right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10414-0
01:21:00.617 --> 01:21:04.655
<v Josh Sparkes>Some clients have two portals like first
stage,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10414-1
01:21:04.655 --> 01:21:09.955
<v Josh Sparkes>second stage where they're going to be
difficult as I say, OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10414-2
01:21:09.955 --> 01:21:14.583
<v Josh Sparkes>but it will just be in once it's in that
instance. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10414-3
01:21:14.583 --> 01:21:18.537
<v Josh Sparkes>so the field that will read portal name
dates.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10450-0
01:21:18.697 --> 01:21:22.782
<v Josh Sparkes>Dates uploaded effective form.
So if you've uploaded it today,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10450-1
01:21:22.782 --> 01:21:27.969
<v Josh Sparkes>but actually because the invoice might
have been dated yesterday, is your date?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10450-2
01:21:27.969 --> 01:21:33.285
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there no validation that you just you
didn't know this is a very live date and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10450-3
01:21:33.285 --> 01:21:34.777
<v Josh Sparkes>we can submit invoices.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10494-0
01:21:35.217 --> 01:21:38.977
<v Josh Sparkes>Historic ones,
but sometimes we go on board and they</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10494-1
01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:44.867
<v Josh Sparkes>were like right with the last six months
of invoices now in the system even though</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10494-2
01:21:44.867 --> 01:21:50.047
<v Josh Sparkes>they've already paid them. OK,
so go live date plus effective date added</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10494-3
01:21:50.047 --> 01:21:53.737
<v Josh Sparkes>to portal.
I mean with that for reporting purposes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10501-0
01:21:54.177 --> 01:22:00.137
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it useful to have also activity with
them retrospectively?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10519-0
01:22:03.457 --> 01:22:08.723
<v Josh Sparkes>It's less information that we need and
service now and you would like to report</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10519-1
01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:11.817
<v Josh Sparkes>on that in the future to get some
insights of.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10562-0
01:22:13.297 --> 01:22:17.452
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't currently just say do we? No,
we don't now.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10562-1
01:22:17.452 --> 01:22:23.725
<v Josh Sparkes>Every year I collectively look at what
we've on boarded to assess our growth as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10562-2
01:22:23.725 --> 01:22:28.978
<v Josh Sparkes>well as the account and the amount of
invoicing we have to upload.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10562-3
01:22:28.978 --> 01:22:32.977
<v Josh Sparkes>But would I be able to do that from
putting cases?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10566-0
01:22:33.057 --> 01:22:35.177
<v Josh Sparkes>See that rather than having to have me
effectively.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10614-0
01:22:37.777 --> 01:22:40.218
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I mean because that's what I'm doing at</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10614-1
01:22:40.218 --> 01:22:43.031
<v Josh Sparkes>the moment.
It will be on boarded all the on boarded</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10614-2
01:22:43.031 --> 01:22:45.632
<v Josh Sparkes>categories.
I'll put it and share well with that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10614-3
01:22:45.632 --> 01:22:49.931
<v Josh Sparkes>financial year that was looking and then
just counting many on boarding requests</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10614-4
01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:53.275
<v Josh Sparkes>we received, right. OK. Yeah,
I mean they're just recommended,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10614-5
01:22:53.275 --> 01:22:56.937
<v Josh Sparkes>you know when I was hearing that some of
your work is retrospective.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10646-0
01:22:57.697 --> 01:23:02.777
<v Josh Sparkes>So if anything that we add these dates
that will help your reporting or anything</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10646-1
01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:06.164
<v Josh Sparkes>you've pulled,
it can be on the dashboard or standard</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10646-2
01:23:06.164 --> 01:23:10.869
<v Josh Sparkes>report that you don't actually have to
pull, just go in and view on there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10646-3
01:23:10.869 --> 01:23:13.817
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's really supporting what would help
you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10706-0
01:23:13.937 --> 01:23:19.046
<v Josh Sparkes>I just wonder as well if that's maybe
something once we've gone through this</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10706-1
01:23:19.046 --> 01:23:21.633
<v Josh Sparkes>stage,
we can revisit from a reporting</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10706-2
01:23:21.633 --> 01:23:25.084
<v Josh Sparkes>perspective.
So if we maybe understand what reports</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10706-3
01:23:25.084 --> 01:23:29.131
<v Josh Sparkes>the guy's currently doing,
we can maybe work it back for me.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10706-4
01:23:29.131 --> 01:23:32.780
<v Josh Sparkes>Would that be OK? Yeah,
I suppose it's reporting is an</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10706-5
01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:33.577
<v Josh Sparkes>interesting.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10754-0
01:23:33.617 --> 01:23:37.893
<v Josh Sparkes>In term and I know that there's a
directive on reporting that really think</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10754-1
01:23:37.893 --> 01:23:42.225
<v Josh Sparkes>about these fields of what questions do I
not have answers to today or what</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10754-2
01:23:42.225 --> 01:23:45.532
<v Josh Sparkes>questions would I like answered and that
goes throughout.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10754-3
01:23:45.532 --> 01:23:48.839
<v Josh Sparkes>You know if only if I could answer this
question quickly,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10754-4
01:23:48.839 --> 01:23:53.058
<v Josh Sparkes>how many clients did we on board last
week from you know those simple and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10754-5
01:23:53.058 --> 01:23:53.457
<v Josh Sparkes>that's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10814-0
01:23:53.617 --> 01:23:56.561
<v Josh Sparkes>For example,
but if you wanted to grow that and plus</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10814-1
01:23:56.561 --> 01:24:00.949
<v Josh Sparkes>the number of invoices that we uploaded,
you know ServiceNow could consolidate</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10814-2
01:24:00.949 --> 01:24:04.782
<v Josh Sparkes>that information to apply on the simple
fields that we add up funds.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10814-3
01:24:04.782 --> 01:24:09.115
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just something to bear in mind.
I mean what you say today isn't parts in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10814-4
01:24:09.115 --> 01:24:12.337
<v Josh Sparkes>stone, it's not something that's rigid,
you know you can.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10828-0
01:24:14.217 --> 01:24:17.461
<v Josh Sparkes>Have a thought later and say actually
I've thought about this or this is what</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10828-1
01:24:17.461 --> 01:24:20.497
<v Josh Sparkes>we do and it could be handy. Yep.
Good one for the parking lot, OK, Yep.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10834-0
01:24:21.857 --> 01:24:23.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Uh, we've already.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10854-0
01:24:25.017 --> 01:24:30.315
<v Josh Sparkes>Talk through that a bit. I workflow.
I think we've captured it essentially is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10854-1
01:24:30.315 --> 01:24:35.817
<v Josh Sparkes>I want to all these clients and then it's
captured and you upload to the report.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10893-0
01:24:37.137 --> 01:24:41.753
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you can come from.
I think that actually that's one question.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10893-1
01:24:41.753 --> 01:24:47.226
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it was your own question that was
raised against some of the pros that can</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10893-2
01:24:47.226 --> 01:24:51.380
<v Josh Sparkes>also come from client or client portal.
Is that correct? Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10893-3
01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:52.897
<v Josh Sparkes>the client can say now.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10916-0
01:24:53.297 --> 01:24:58.052
<v Josh Sparkes>If they've got our details,
they can just request it from us to step</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10916-1
01:24:58.052 --> 01:25:01.085
<v Josh Sparkes>in.
The portal could say that we've already</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10916-2
01:25:01.085 --> 01:25:04.807
<v Josh Sparkes>got a profile and then just connect us
straight away.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10916-3
01:25:04.807 --> 01:25:06.737
<v Josh Sparkes>So we're getting the portal.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10952-0
01:25:09.377 --> 01:25:13.816
<v Josh Sparkes>So to perhaps like for instance,
if client from legal tracker decides</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10952-1
01:25:13.816 --> 01:25:18.382
<v Josh Sparkes>they're not using legal tracker anymore
and they're moving to hospital,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/10952-2
01:25:18.382 --> 01:25:22.377
<v Josh Sparkes>that would be another client on boarding
because they will be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11008-0
01:25:23.617 --> 01:25:26.967
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm sorry.
So the incentive client is on one portal</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11008-1
01:25:26.967 --> 01:25:30.768
<v Josh Sparkes>at the moment and then decides to move to
a different one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11008-2
01:25:30.768 --> 01:25:35.793
<v Josh Sparkes>They would obviously also let us know
that we need to onboard them on the new</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11008-3
01:25:35.793 --> 01:25:40.689
<v Josh Sparkes>ports on that and deactivate on the other
one or yeah, we don't deactivate,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11008-4
01:25:40.689 --> 01:25:43.137
<v Josh Sparkes>just shut down on the uninfected date.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11049-0
01:25:43.417 --> 01:25:46.939
<v Josh Sparkes>And I'm going as of this day,
we're going dark on this platform, right,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11049-1
01:25:46.939 --> 01:25:50.656
<v Josh Sparkes>because we're going live on this day on
V1 and that do you get that through</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11049-2
01:25:50.656 --> 01:25:53.640
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail at the moment? Yeah,
it'll be an external e-mail, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11049-3
01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:57.065
<v Josh Sparkes>And then for tracking purposes of
everything you onboarded as Tim was</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11049-4
01:25:57.065 --> 01:25:58.777
<v Josh Sparkes>saying is that you would go in and.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11067-0
01:25:59.217 --> 01:26:05.332
<v Josh Sparkes>Effectively write a record that says
client on boarding or client off loaded</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11067-1
01:26:05.332 --> 01:26:10.257
<v Josh Sparkes>on from one and on boarding on to the
other. OK, that's good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11097-0
01:26:12.657 --> 01:26:16.612
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Approvals,
looks like we're all aligned on that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11097-1
01:26:16.612 --> 01:26:22.136
<v Josh Sparkes>Debbie had a, you had a point there.
I think that a lot of the approvals,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11097-2
01:26:22.136 --> 01:26:26.017
<v Josh Sparkes>parent name, legal,
regulatory is all pre approved.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11111-0
01:26:27.777 --> 01:26:37.617
<v Josh Sparkes>And there's nothing. There's no.
Do we have any light checks on this? No.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11143-0
01:26:40.817 --> 01:26:45.996
<v Josh Sparkes>Those are no peer reviews. No. OK,
just going back to that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11143-1
01:26:45.996 --> 01:26:52.556
<v Josh Sparkes>there are no special exceptions that
anybody that Bank of America might be,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11143-2
01:26:52.556 --> 01:26:57.217
<v Josh Sparkes>but literally no approvals or no nothing
exceptional.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11173-0
01:26:57.977 --> 01:27:01.397
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
SLAS and we are going to have a follow up</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11173-1
01:27:01.397 --> 01:27:05.635
<v Josh Sparkes>session on SLAS finance in general in a
couple of weeks.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11173-2
01:27:05.635 --> 01:27:11.434
<v Josh Sparkes>So I mean I don't know if we want to
really decide anything for definite here</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11173-3
01:27:11.434 --> 01:27:11.657
<v Josh Sparkes>or.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11197-0
01:27:12.817 --> 01:27:17.575
<v Josh Sparkes>Kind of depends on that conversation
because it'd be determined by the comment</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11197-1
01:27:17.575 --> 01:27:20.888
<v Josh Sparkes>because they'll be like if we go in line
the next day,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11197-2
01:27:20.888 --> 01:27:24.020
<v Josh Sparkes>we have to make sure everything's done by
that day.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11197-3
01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:28.417
<v Josh Sparkes>It might not be for a couple of months
tonight. We're talking 10 months.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11251-0
01:27:29.057 --> 01:27:34.159
<v Mark Sedgey>These will be reactive, right? Sorry,
did I hear that? Was that what I didn't?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11214-0
01:27:32.897 --> 01:27:35.817
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11251-1
01:27:34.159 --> 01:27:37.065
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah,
because the the thing that you want on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11251-2
01:27:37.065 --> 01:27:40.359
<v Mark Sedgey>these ones would be if there's a task or
activity,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11251-3
01:27:40.359 --> 01:27:45.074
<v Mark Sedgey>you'd want a target day and then you'd
want some sort of measure to say,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11251-4
01:27:45.074 --> 01:27:48.497
<v Mark Sedgey>you know,
90 odd percent hit within expected target.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11282-0
01:27:48.697 --> 01:27:52.530
<v Mark Sedgey>Midday or something.
So it wouldn't necessarily be a day's set</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11282-1
01:27:52.530 --> 01:27:56.181
<v Mark Sedgey>service expectation.
It would be one about hitting the date</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11282-2
01:27:56.181 --> 01:27:59.892
<v Mark Sedgey>that you needed to do it to get your bill
in or or you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11272-0
01:27:58.297 --> 01:27:58.457
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11320-0
01:27:59.697 --> 01:28:04.947
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, definitely. And as well,
we've got boarding. We can do it in a day.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11282-3
01:27:59.892 --> 01:28:01.657
<v Mark Sedgey>just see what I'm getting at.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11320-1
01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:09.476
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes it can take months.
I had one awarding this year that took</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11320-2
01:28:09.476 --> 01:28:13.217
<v Josh Sparkes>six months and that was down to the point.
Oh, well, so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11376-0
01:28:10.457 --> 01:28:13.102
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, yeah.
Because I'm assuming that there'll be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11376-1
01:28:13.102 --> 01:28:17.280
<v Mark Sedgey>that you could potentially come into
roadblocks where if data is not available</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11376-2
01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:21.565
<v Mark Sedgey>to onboard that client or they're slow to
provide the data that you need to then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11376-3
01:28:21.565 --> 01:28:23.998
<v Mark Sedgey>onboard, you know,
so you've got a number of,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11376-4
01:28:23.998 --> 01:28:26.696
<v Mark Sedgey>how should we say a number of variables
that some,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11376-5
01:28:26.696 --> 01:28:29.817
<v Mark Sedgey>some of them out of your control,
but then what we can do.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11417-0
01:28:30.257 --> 01:28:33.872
<v Mark Sedgey>Is we can look to say if you've got a
state on that record,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11417-1
01:28:33.872 --> 01:28:37.427
<v Mark Sedgey>we could put it on hold if you're waiting
for information.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11417-2
01:28:37.427 --> 01:28:41.704
<v Mark Sedgey>So it's thus that it enables you to
measure your activity and workload</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11417-3
01:28:41.704 --> 01:28:45.802
<v Mark Sedgey>separate from perhaps what you know
what's outside of your control.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11417-4
01:28:45.802 --> 01:28:49.417
<v Mark Sedgey>But that could be considered when you
look at your service.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11418-0
01:28:49.857 --> 01:28:50.937
<v Mark Sedgey>Expectations.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11447-0
01:28:52.657 --> 01:28:55.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.
And you know Mark touched on it like that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11447-1
01:28:55.417 --> 01:28:59.998
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow that you get so far, you know,
because you believe that the workflow</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11447-2
01:28:59.998 --> 01:29:04.697
<v Josh Sparkes>from what we're seeing is a happy path
would be new requests, work in progress.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11496-0
01:29:05.937 --> 01:29:09.964
<v Josh Sparkes>Uploaded to, you know,
information uploaded, closed completely,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11496-1
01:29:09.964 --> 01:29:13.929
<v Josh Sparkes>not very simple or you know new work in
progress, closed down.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11496-2
01:29:13.929 --> 01:29:18.460
<v Josh Sparkes>But it sounds like you're in that
scenario that you keep mentioning the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11496-3
01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:23.117
<v Josh Sparkes>painful six month on boarding clients.
What were the pain points that you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11496-4
01:29:23.117 --> 01:29:25.257
<v Josh Sparkes>encountered that you had to await?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11499-0
01:29:25.697 --> 01:29:28.897
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a complete we needed to have.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11507-0
01:29:30.257 --> 01:29:32.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Uh,
public liability insurance documents we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11507-1
01:29:32.897 --> 01:29:33.857
<v Josh Sparkes>needing to have.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11547-0
01:29:34.897 --> 01:29:37.322
<v Josh Sparkes>So there was another document we had to
get.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11547-1
01:29:37.322 --> 01:29:41.633
<v Josh Sparkes>We had to put our banking certificates.
So I had to pull these information from</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11547-2
01:29:41.633 --> 01:29:44.813
<v Josh Sparkes>all these other teams.
We then submitted it to the client.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11547-3
01:29:44.813 --> 01:29:49.016
<v Josh Sparkes>It then took them weeks to look at it
because it goes to live and love in the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11547-4
01:29:49.016 --> 01:29:51.657
<v Josh Sparkes>team.
They then came back with another question.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11588-0
01:29:52.417 --> 01:29:57.013
<v Josh Sparkes>Answered it a couple of weeks.
Another question, right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11588-1
01:29:57.013 --> 01:30:03.578
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's there on boarding process, right.
OK. And then another couple of weeks,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11588-2
01:30:03.578 --> 01:30:07.189
<v Josh Sparkes>another question,
another form to fill out.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11588-3
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:11.457
<v Josh Sparkes>And is that rare in like one or two a
year is that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11623-0
01:30:11.697 --> 01:30:18.417
<v Josh Sparkes>No, that's not what you're talking about.
Normally we can wrap it up in a couple of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11623-1
01:30:18.417 --> 01:30:22.577
<v Josh Sparkes>weeks. OK.
So is that something you want to capture</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11623-2
01:30:22.577 --> 01:30:28.817
<v Josh Sparkes>on the board that on these requests that
you've completed or we've completed,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11623-3
01:30:28.817 --> 01:30:31.457
<v Josh Sparkes>we get that right, we're waiting.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11656-0
01:30:31.537 --> 01:30:35.432
<v Josh Sparkes>Our part, we're waiting. Yeah,
you'll find that would be a common theme</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11656-1
01:30:35.432 --> 01:30:38.245
<v Josh Sparkes>for our process.
We do our part a lot of that is is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11656-2
01:30:38.245 --> 01:30:40.842
<v Josh Sparkes>waiting.
So that's something the fields that we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11656-3
01:30:40.842 --> 01:30:44.845
<v Josh Sparkes>want to capture on there as well.
Then we can go back to fields is beyond</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11656-4
01:30:44.845 --> 01:30:46.577
<v Josh Sparkes>the standard state fields, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11669-0
01:30:46.577 --> 01:30:49.546
<v Josh Sparkes>Um,
so our onboarding processes have been</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11669-1
01:30:49.546 --> 01:30:53.577
<v Josh Sparkes>completed with that essentially all
waiting information.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11671-0
01:30:54.977 --> 01:30:55.817
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good. Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11725-0
01:31:00.817 --> 01:31:05.258
<v Josh Sparkes>I think just going back on the SLAP piece,
I think the approach that we will take</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11725-1
01:31:05.258 --> 01:31:08.724
<v Josh Sparkes>that Mark obviously touched on as well as
looking at OLA level.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11725-2
01:31:08.724 --> 01:31:13.111
<v Josh Sparkes>So your task level and what you're doing
in there that will then roll up to what</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11725-3
01:31:13.111 --> 01:31:16.577
<v Josh Sparkes>the SLA potentially is and that's what
we'll then discuss with.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11744-0
01:31:17.057 --> 01:31:20.788
<v Josh Sparkes>Your stakeholders and things.
So we'll approach that in the same way</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11744-1
01:31:20.788 --> 01:31:23.546
<v Josh Sparkes>across ask and and kind of build it from
that way.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11744-2
01:31:23.546 --> 01:31:25.817
<v Josh Sparkes>So probably something we can come back on.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11786-0
01:31:29.857 --> 01:31:33.147
<v Josh Sparkes>Notifications. Yeah, those patients,
you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11786-1
01:31:33.147 --> 01:31:37.907
<v Josh Sparkes>great service now can handle the
different state changes, etcetera.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11786-2
01:31:37.907 --> 01:31:43.157
<v Josh Sparkes>But it would sound that probably you
don't want to keep getting emails for</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11786-3
01:31:43.157 --> 01:31:46.097
<v Josh Sparkes>everything that changes, so you would use.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11829-0
01:31:46.097 --> 01:31:50.127
<v Josh Sparkes>ServiceNow proactively the dashboards,
you see the statuses,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11829-1
01:31:50.127 --> 01:31:54.817
<v Josh Sparkes>everything that comes in is new.
So whilst you can have notifications,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11829-2
01:31:54.817 --> 01:31:59.706
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not correctly if I'm wrong,
particularly for high volume or this type</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11829-3
01:31:59.706 --> 01:32:02.217
<v Josh Sparkes>of activity which isn't triage per se.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11867-0
01:32:02.657 --> 01:32:08.188
<v Josh Sparkes>Then using dashboards for activity to go
to, you can drill down in them might be,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11867-1
01:32:08.188 --> 01:32:11.494
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
something I've known in the past where</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11867-2
01:32:11.494 --> 01:32:16.755
<v Josh Sparkes>people just turn off their notifications
because they just go to service now.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11853-0
01:32:14.777 --> 01:32:15.017
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11867-3
01:32:16.755 --> 01:32:18.577
<v Josh Sparkes>So recommendations is that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11911-0
01:32:18.977 --> 01:32:22.895
<v Josh Sparkes>If you've got low numbers and it would
improve your SLA,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11911-1
01:32:22.895 --> 01:32:27.707
<v Josh Sparkes>obviously it can be very powerful,
but for high numbers and your this</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11911-2
01:32:27.707 --> 01:32:32.176
<v Josh Sparkes>activity admin particularly,
it's probably recommendation to use</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11959-0
01:32:31.457 --> 01:32:35.347
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, the thing, no,
all I was going to say is the thing about</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11911-3
01:32:32.176 --> 01:32:34.857
<v Josh Sparkes>dashboards. Oh sorry Mark, when you go.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11959-1
01:32:35.347 --> 01:32:40.163
<v Mark Sedgey>the dashboards is there is real to nil
near to real time as you can get them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11959-2
01:32:40.163 --> 01:32:45.103
<v Mark Sedgey>Whereas if you're relying upon sort of
notification and you don't see it or you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11959-3
01:32:45.103 --> 01:32:49.611
<v Mark Sedgey>rely upon reports or whatever,
the thing about the dashboards is it will</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11959-4
01:32:49.611 --> 01:32:51.217
<v Mark Sedgey>flag up. So if you've got.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11987-0
01:32:51.217 --> 01:32:55.216
<v Mark Sedgey>If you've got something that's gone over
time or something that needs needs just a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11987-1
01:32:55.216 --> 01:32:57.529
<v Mark Sedgey>nudge,
you should be able to see it because you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11987-2
01:32:57.529 --> 01:33:01.287
<v Mark Sedgey>can set rules to you know how that's
flagged and how that's presented in your</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/11987-3
01:33:01.287 --> 01:33:01.817
<v Mark Sedgey>dashboards.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12033-0
01:33:03.777 --> 01:33:06.321
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I was just going to clarify when we talk</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12033-1
01:33:06.321 --> 01:33:09.460
<v Josh Sparkes>about notifications, Lauren and Megan,
there's two sides.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12033-2
01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:12.870
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's obviously internal
notifications for you as a team,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12033-3
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:17.038
<v Josh Sparkes>which Deborah's talking about there.
We would use dashboards very similar to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12033-4
01:33:17.038 --> 01:33:19.257
<v Josh Sparkes>what we use at the moment and share well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12090-0
01:33:19.377 --> 01:33:23.174
<v Josh Sparkes>It'll be they're better,
but it's the similar kind of approach.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12090-1
01:33:23.174 --> 01:33:26.200
<v Josh Sparkes>But you also have obviously if there's
requesters,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12090-2
01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:30.769
<v Josh Sparkes>more notifications we send on that side
and actually they've got an employee</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12090-3
01:33:30.769 --> 01:33:35.279
<v Josh Sparkes>workspace that they would use like a
dashboard where notifications will get</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12090-4
01:33:35.279 --> 01:33:39.017
<v Josh Sparkes>sent rather than having to send e-mail
notifications etcetera.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12130-0
01:33:39.217 --> 01:33:41.393
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll explore what that looks like as
well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12130-1
01:33:41.393 --> 01:33:44.912
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll probably be a recommendation from
an ask perspective how we set that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12130-2
01:33:44.912 --> 01:33:48.663
<v Josh Sparkes>but there might be exceptions depending
on different groups of stakeholders that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12130-3
01:33:48.663 --> 01:33:51.024
<v Josh Sparkes>we have.
So a partner might be different to what a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12130-4
01:33:51.024 --> 01:33:53.293
<v Josh Sparkes>PE might be,
but we can have further discussions</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12130-5
01:33:53.293 --> 01:33:54.497
<v Josh Sparkes>around that sort of stuff.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12177-0
01:33:54.657 --> 01:33:57.602
<v Josh Sparkes>As you said,
there's that different heads of requester</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12177-1
01:33:57.602 --> 01:34:00.172
<v Josh Sparkes>might be sending them and they might,
you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12177-2
01:34:00.172 --> 01:34:04.349
<v Josh Sparkes>and then they get a notification saying
it's done and they're thinking, well,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12177-3
01:34:04.349 --> 01:34:06.759
<v Josh Sparkes>I've inferred that it was done or,
you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12177-4
01:34:06.759 --> 01:34:10.989
<v Josh Sparkes>how much communication do you want to
give them once they've made that request</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12177-5
01:34:10.989 --> 01:34:11.257
<v Josh Sparkes>they.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12226-0
01:34:11.537 --> 01:34:15.267
<v Josh Sparkes>You know how much updates do they want.
But for your day-to-day, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12226-1
01:34:15.267 --> 01:34:19.196
<v Josh Sparkes>equally draw a notification every time
you get a new client that's onboarding.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12226-2
01:34:19.196 --> 01:34:22.578
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably not. You'll go to your dashboard,
you can see them as new.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12226-3
01:34:22.578 --> 01:34:26.607
<v Josh Sparkes>You can see them that they're three days
old, five days old, whichever you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12226-4
01:34:26.607 --> 01:34:28.497
<v Josh Sparkes>you might want to view them this week.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12248-0
01:34:28.497 --> 01:34:31.869
<v Josh Sparkes>Comes with that Wednesday and Thursday,
everything that's outstanding,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12248-1
01:34:31.869 --> 01:34:33.959
<v Josh Sparkes>so you can clear it for the following
week.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12248-2
01:34:33.959 --> 01:34:37.617
<v Josh Sparkes>You can have all those dashboards to
manage your what was traditionally your</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12248-3
01:34:37.617 --> 01:34:38.377
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail activity.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12293-0
01:34:40.897 --> 01:34:44.789
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, well,
particularly for assignment groups where</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12293-1
01:34:44.789 --> 01:34:49.636
<v Josh Sparkes>you're all getting the same e-mail and
inferred of. Is it for me?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12293-2
01:34:49.636 --> 01:34:53.235
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it not for me?
Is someone else picking it up?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12293-3
01:34:53.235 --> 01:34:58.522
<v Josh Sparkes>But when you've got that power,
obviously on those issues where it goes</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12293-4
01:34:58.522 --> 01:34:59.257
<v Josh Sparkes>assign to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12309-0
01:34:59.777 --> 01:35:04.216
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's useful,
but your dashboards is the recommendation.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12309-1
01:35:04.216 --> 01:35:08.297
<v Josh Sparkes>So where did we land on notifications for
the requester?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12348-0
01:35:11.857 --> 01:35:17.010
<v Josh Sparkes>So is there a directive or you're looking
at that piece as a obviously a piece when</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12348-1
01:35:17.010 --> 01:35:21.365
<v Josh Sparkes>we work out what the employee works,
what is the right wording for it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12348-2
01:35:21.365 --> 01:35:24.923
<v Josh Sparkes>I can never get the right word in the
employee workspace.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12348-3
01:35:24.923 --> 01:35:26.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that what it's called?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12386-0
01:35:26.897 --> 01:35:30.796
<v Josh Sparkes>Employee portal. Employee portal.
When they see their notifications and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12386-1
01:35:30.796 --> 01:35:34.858
<v Josh Sparkes>like their progression of their tasks,
yeah, requests that they've raised,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12386-2
01:35:34.858 --> 01:35:38.378
<v Josh Sparkes>whatever area that is,
we'll need to agree with that. It's like,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12432-0
01:35:37.617 --> 01:35:40.876
<v Mark Sedgey>What you sorry guys,
what you might want to consider is that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12386-3
01:35:38.378 --> 01:35:39.137
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we'll.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12432-1
01:35:40.876 --> 01:35:43.494
<v Mark Sedgey>if something's been raised outside of
your team,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12432-2
01:35:43.494 --> 01:35:46.325
<v Mark Sedgey>then it triggers A notification to say
we've got it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12432-3
01:35:46.325 --> 01:35:50.439
<v Mark Sedgey>we're working on it sort of thing.
But if it's triggered by a member of your</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12432-4
01:35:50.439 --> 01:35:53.057
<v Mark Sedgey>groups,
you don't need to launch a notification.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12439-0
01:35:55.137 --> 01:35:58.481
<v Mark Sedgey>Do you know what I mean?
So what you can do is choose when you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12439-1
01:35:58.481 --> 01:36:00.657
<v Mark Sedgey>target a notification and when you don't.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12442-0
01:36:03.417 --> 01:36:04.897
<v Mark Sedgey>Did that make sense?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12510-0
01:36:05.497 --> 01:36:10.612
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I suppose for client on boarding,
what they want to know is, is it done?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12510-1
01:36:10.612 --> 01:36:14.043
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, it's not,
it's not that I'm working on it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12464-0
01:36:12.417 --> 01:36:13.817
<v Mark Sedgey>Yes, we.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12510-2
01:36:14.043 --> 01:36:18.382
<v Josh Sparkes>it's it's it's similar to like a network
that we're working on it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12476-0
01:36:17.297 --> 01:36:18.137
<v Mark Sedgey>We left.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12510-3
01:36:18.382 --> 01:36:23.497
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's it's it's incompletion that
status when it changed to close complete.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12486-0
01:36:19.137 --> 01:36:19.657
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12531-0
01:36:23.617 --> 01:36:27.136
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, well, there's two things.
The first one needs to be that, yes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12531-1
01:36:27.136 --> 01:36:30.758
<v Mark Sedgey>we've got it and we're on it.
And then the next one will be it's done,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12531-2
01:36:30.758 --> 01:36:32.697
<v Mark Sedgey>isn't it? You'd want those handshakes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12528-0
01:36:31.617 --> 01:36:31.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12532-0
01:36:34.697 --> 01:36:35.097
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12534-0
01:36:41.937 --> 01:36:42.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Mhm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12565-0
01:36:43.857 --> 01:36:47.435
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
that's the last thing on our work book.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12565-1
01:36:47.435 --> 01:36:53.210
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there anything else, Deborah,
you think that we need to know to put</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12565-2
01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:57.683
<v Josh Sparkes>this together?
There's a good sense of what we want to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12565-3
01:36:57.683 --> 01:36:58.497
<v Josh Sparkes>look like.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12573-0
01:36:58.977 --> 01:37:03.399
<v Josh Sparkes>The state changes,
I think we've captured as new work in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12573-1
01:37:03.399 --> 01:37:04.097
<v Josh Sparkes>progress.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12583-0
01:37:05.057 --> 01:37:09.161
<v Josh Sparkes>On hold,
waiting information closed complete,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12583-1
01:37:09.161 --> 01:37:10.857
<v Josh Sparkes>I suppose the only.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12620-0
01:37:12.097 --> 01:37:17.134
<v Josh Sparkes>Other you've got different things like
you've got rejection, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12620-1
01:37:17.134 --> 01:37:20.752
<v Josh Sparkes>do they get?
I'm assuming that it is an end to end</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12620-2
01:37:20.752 --> 01:37:25.434
<v Josh Sparkes>completion process whether you have
rejections or reasons why no,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12620-3
01:37:25.434 --> 01:37:27.137
<v Josh Sparkes>not for on boarding, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12633-0
01:37:27.617 --> 01:37:32.048
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just assumes that it's been
requested that what's going to be done.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12633-1
01:37:32.048 --> 01:37:34.537
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, no duplicates, don't get asked twice.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12674-0
01:37:36.657 --> 01:37:40.332
<v Josh Sparkes>It's nice.
I think that is a good recommendations</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12674-1
01:37:40.332 --> 01:37:45.698
<v Josh Sparkes>that we have this one form globalised
view. That's a good landing point.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12674-2
01:37:45.698 --> 01:37:51.358
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just going to ask Lord and Megan,
is there any other pinpoints on that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12674-3
01:37:51.358 --> 01:37:53.417
<v Josh Sparkes>process that is frustrating?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12676-0
01:37:53.697 --> 01:37:57.377
<v Josh Sparkes>That hasn't been discussed.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12679-0
01:37:59.577 --> 01:38:02.057
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, cool. All right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12694-0
01:38:03.057 --> 01:38:06.137
<v Josh Sparkes>Great. I think that'll definitely, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12727-0
01:38:03.537 --> 01:38:07.404
<v Mark Sedgey>Sorry, sorry,
I was slow getting off the off the mute</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12727-1
01:38:07.404 --> 01:38:10.913
<v Mark Sedgey>button.
It's a is we talk about pain points from</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12698-0
01:38:07.777 --> 01:38:08.777
<v Josh Sparkes>That's fine.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12727-2
01:38:10.913 --> 01:38:16.283
<v Mark Sedgey>within the team on this process.
What are the sorts of things that you get</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12727-3
01:38:16.283 --> 01:38:18.217
<v Mark Sedgey>hassled by the customer on?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12752-0
01:38:18.857 --> 01:38:23.836
<v Mark Sedgey>And are we addressing some of those with
the thinking here or are there anything</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12752-1
01:38:23.836 --> 01:38:26.848
<v Mark Sedgey>that say they keep hassling you,
ringing you up,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12752-2
01:38:26.848 --> 01:38:29.737
<v Mark Sedgey>giving you failure demand as a result of
what?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12797-0
01:38:31.937 --> 01:38:37.103
<v Josh Sparkes>I suppose the hassle we get from from our
request is internal.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12797-1
01:38:37.103 --> 01:38:41.942
<v Josh Sparkes>It will be has this been done yet?
Where are we with that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12797-2
01:38:41.942 --> 01:38:48.339
<v Josh Sparkes>But I suppose that will eradicate those
when we put in the status as in going</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12789-0
01:38:46.737 --> 01:38:47.337
<v Mark Sedgey>Perfect.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12797-3
01:38:48.339 --> 01:38:49.897
<v Josh Sparkes>waiting for client.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12826-0
01:38:50.457 --> 01:38:56.366
<v Josh Sparkes>And Mark's want me to add to that the
field enrichment upfront by the requester</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12826-1
01:38:56.366 --> 01:39:01.757
<v Josh Sparkes>that they're completing this detail
rather than an e-mail would probably</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12826-2
01:39:01.757 --> 01:39:05.377
<v Josh Sparkes>eradicate some of that that turn around
as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12827-0
01:39:06.297 --> 01:39:06.577
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

01:39:08.657 --> 01:39:12.535
<v Josh Sparkes>All right, great.
If everything we landed on makes sense to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12859-1
01:39:12.535 --> 01:39:15.444
<v Josh Sparkes>everyone,
I think that's in a good position.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12859-2
01:39:15.444 --> 01:39:19.775
<v Josh Sparkes>Some things to follow up on,
some things across the board to be be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12859-3
01:39:19.775 --> 01:39:23.137
<v Josh Sparkes>addressed,
but it's say that's looking pretty good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12861-0
01:39:24.017 --> 01:39:25.137
<v Josh Sparkes>That'll tick over here.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12898-0
01:39:26.737 --> 01:39:31.037
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, we've got, I mean,
I did put in for a break at 11:15,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12898-1
01:39:31.037 --> 01:39:35.931
<v Josh Sparkes>but we're about to go on to another
process and they, as you see,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12898-2
01:39:35.931 --> 01:39:41.270
<v Josh Sparkes>they do take a little bit of time to get
to the people for a break now,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12898-3
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:42.457
<v Josh Sparkes>I think for the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12908-0
01:39:42.857 --> 01:39:48.217
<v Josh Sparkes>Sake of Yeah. All right, let's take, uh,
510, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12917-0
01:39:49.537 --> 01:39:52.417
<v Josh Sparkes>There's on the call having a quick open
it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12925-0
01:39:51.657 --> 01:39:55.577
<v Mark Sedgey>What are we?
What are we agreeing back at 10/2 or?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12927-0
01:39:54.417 --> 01:39:54.697
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12931-0
01:39:58.737 --> 01:40:00.057
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah, perfect.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12934-0
01:40:01.657 --> 01:40:01.777
<v Mark Sedgey>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12944-0
01:40:13.097 --> 01:40:26.217
<v Josh Sparkes>And and then went with us to go under.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12964-0
01:40:31.057 --> 01:40:41.391
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can take it. You ping me,
that's right. So I think I'm sorry.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12964-1
01:40:41.391 --> 01:40:50.377
<v Josh Sparkes>This is your most expensive.
Start with you. Oh, it's safe.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12974-0
01:40:50.737 --> 01:40:57.883
<v Josh Sparkes>It may sometimes make sure that trigger
the only only questions. Thank you. Uh,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12974-1
01:40:57.883 --> 01:40:58.777
<v Josh Sparkes>it's yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12984-0
01:41:00.097 --> 01:41:19.697
<v Josh Sparkes>That's better that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12987-0
01:41:20.017 --> 01:41:28.857
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, it's too much. Oh, it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/12988-0
01:41:28.897 --> 01:41:29.577
<v Josh Sparkes>Let's see.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13010-0
01:41:30.337 --> 01:41:49.897
<v Josh Sparkes>So that means more aware.
So it was to see everything.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13045-0
01:41:50.017 --> 01:42:06.895
<v Josh Sparkes>It's trying to draw out, not draw out.
It's still doing it as a they obviously</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13045-1
01:42:06.895 --> 01:42:08.177
<v Josh Sparkes>still.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13074-0
01:42:09.857 --> 01:42:17.361
<v Josh Sparkes>I expect that,
but the the process is still done for</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13074-1
01:42:17.361 --> 01:42:26.988
<v Josh Sparkes>what you're testing for,
the same information. I'll have an e-mail.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13074-2
01:42:26.988 --> 01:42:29.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, that's right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13080-0
01:42:29.777 --> 01:42:36.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah. OK. I can fine. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13107-0
01:42:37.377 --> 01:42:44.822
<v Josh Sparkes>It's taking us two months just to get to
what we get. I just want the change.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13107-1
01:42:44.822 --> 01:42:51.600
<v Josh Sparkes>From the change perspective,
it just seems like whoever's actually put</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13107-2
01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:57.137
<v Josh Sparkes>a wise there, they just need to turn it.
But usually the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13140-0
01:42:57.297 --> 01:43:01.153
<v Josh Sparkes>Of our customer. We've done this,
that it's the same amount.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13140-1
01:43:01.153 --> 01:43:04.315
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not that things are nothing that
we've done.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13140-2
01:43:04.315 --> 01:43:09.057
<v Josh Sparkes>You don't feel like happy to build.
It's partners we have to be in contact</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13140-3
01:43:09.057 --> 01:43:13.925
<v Josh Sparkes>with the day. That's true. Yeah, exactly.
So that's why I'm just to do that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13140-4
01:43:13.925 --> 01:43:16.897
<v Josh Sparkes>If you've got enough time yet,
please do this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13161-0
01:43:16.977 --> 01:43:23.787
<v Josh Sparkes>What managers we have. Sorry,
I think it was like you think of that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13161-1
01:43:23.787 --> 01:43:30.993
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, you know, I can choose by. I mean,
I mean, it's not really. Sorry,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13161-2
01:43:30.993 --> 01:43:36.817
<v Josh Sparkes>things have been mentioned.
I think to put me on the spot.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13166-0
01:43:36.897 --> 01:43:41.481
<v Josh Sparkes>But before,
I don't think it's the whole time. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13166-1
01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:43.817
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you should find it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13187-0
01:43:45.257 --> 01:43:56.273
<v Josh Sparkes>I didn't want to say what one. Yeah,
that's what. But normally, if we do work,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13187-1
01:43:56.273 --> 01:44:00.457
<v Josh Sparkes>we all trying to get shuffled.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13208-0
01:44:00.897 --> 01:44:09.109
<v Josh Sparkes>No, thank you very much. It's OK.
I know it's, you know, it always doesn't,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13208-1
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:16.024
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, trivialize it.
It's just considered what would be the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13208-2
01:44:16.024 --> 01:44:17.537
<v Josh Sparkes>pain doing it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13241-0
01:44:18.937 --> 01:44:36.817
<v Josh Sparkes>No, no, no. Oh yeah. I went through.
It is services.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13247-0
01:44:37.377 --> 01:44:46.697
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, yes, yes, then we'll show you, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13288-0
01:44:50.097 --> 01:44:54.964
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean in the new books in 22 you might
say it's just one,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13288-1
01:44:54.964 --> 01:45:00.574
<v Josh Sparkes>but with variations of again,
I don't want to trivialise it because</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13288-2
01:45:00.574 --> 01:45:06.184
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not and you're actually,
I think you're the highest in all the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13288-3
01:45:06.184 --> 01:45:07.257
<v Josh Sparkes>work streams.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13309-0
01:45:07.537 --> 01:45:17.609
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, we're processing something,
but then it looked more actually that's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13309-1
01:45:17.609 --> 01:45:22.897
<v Josh Sparkes>just in versus then you get notifications.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13339-0
01:45:24.737 --> 01:45:29.147
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, every time.
I thought your activity on the count of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13339-1
01:45:29.147 --> 01:45:32.949
<v Josh Sparkes>Tim's was like 6 that, you know,
there was a nap,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13339-2
01:45:32.949 --> 01:45:37.511
<v Josh Sparkes>which if you think across to you,
probably like 50, 60, 70,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13339-3
01:45:37.511 --> 01:45:40.097
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a lot of stuff every time.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13359-0
01:45:40.097 --> 01:45:49.272
<v Josh Sparkes>Does it feel like that every 5 minutes?
Yeah, because like everyone's show up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13359-1
01:45:49.272 --> 01:45:55.777
<v Josh Sparkes>Like it's about 140 tickets constantly
doesn't go down.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13375-0
01:45:56.297 --> 01:46:04.164
<v Josh Sparkes>But I think it's just in the at the start.
We've got on top of everything.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13375-1
01:46:04.164 --> 01:46:12.137
<v Josh Sparkes>What team will give that to you?
We'll stop when I'll call your emails and.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13406-0
01:46:12.497 --> 01:46:17.842
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, then I'll.
So when you you like the meeting here,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13406-1
01:46:17.842 --> 01:46:24.870
<v Josh Sparkes>I was sleeping last week and that's good.
Yeah, that were really good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13406-2
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:28.137
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm very productive in this time.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13409-0
01:46:28.737 --> 01:46:32.017
<v Josh Sparkes>They were done in a very different way,
which is also fun.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13444-0
01:46:32.737 --> 01:46:38.063
<v Josh Sparkes>Well, I think there, I mean,
since now there's certain things that you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13444-1
01:46:38.063 --> 01:46:44.215
<v Josh Sparkes>can take off the shelf where you might
sometimes it doesn't say, it's a nice box.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13444-2
01:46:44.215 --> 01:46:48.566
<v Josh Sparkes>This is like it's all sorts of the
reference on your CRM.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13444-3
01:46:48.566 --> 01:46:51.417
<v Josh Sparkes>So how you use the heavy lifting over.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13456-0
01:46:51.937 --> 01:47:03.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Well, the most, it's it's, it's, it's,
it's, it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13478-0
01:47:07.257 --> 01:47:12.074
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, I understand you. It's like,

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13478-1
01:47:12.074 --> 01:47:16.365

<v Josh Sparkes>what you do is, uh, yeah, do it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13498-0
01:47:26.217 --> 01:47:37.567

And then I kind of do stuff on there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13498-1

01:47:45.937 --> 01:47:50.797
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I mean,
that's whether I was expecting. I was,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13520-1
01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:56.024
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, I don't think I,
I was very important about those,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13520-2
01:47:56.024 --> 01:48:01.893
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, when I arrived,
I had to come back to that. So, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13520-3
01:48:01.893 --> 01:48:03.177
<v Josh Sparkes>that's what's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13535-0
01:48:03.737 --> 01:48:14.377
<v Josh Sparkes>Thanks, Councillor.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13550-0
01:48:23.137 --> 01:48:36.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, brilliant.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13577-0
01:48:42.737 --> 01:48:53.410
<v Josh Sparkes>Because that all looks very American.
What's the architecture? It's well,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13577-1
01:48:53.410 --> 01:49:02.497

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13596-0
01:49:02.577 --> 01:49:06.233
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13596-1
01:49:06.233 --> 01:49:10.539
<v Josh Sparkes>gender. We should get out,
even though 10 miles out,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13596-2
01:49:10.539 --> 01:49:15.252
<v Josh Sparkes>was it a bit green?
I've got to be still like towards the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13596-3
01:49:15.252 --> 01:49:18.177
<v Josh Sparkes>host. I mean, you need to drive out.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13623-0
01:49:18.177 --> 01:49:34.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that's what I have.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13631-0
01:49:35.057 --> 01:49:54.617
<v Josh Sparkes>That's fine. It's only good. Yeah,
that's something. Hello.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13647-0

<v Josh Sparkes>They stayed there as soon as I could.
Are you from? Yes, I'm. I'm right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13647-1
01:50:08.912 --> 01:50:14.417
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm between the rest of them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13653-0
01:50:15.017 --> 01:50:21.964
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, well, we can't. We can't. I mean,
well, I mean, I'll have like,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13653-1
01:50:21.964 --> 01:50:29.704
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll plan on having. I didn't. I didn't.
I didn't see what happens, but yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13653-2
01:50:29.704 --> 01:50:30.697
<v Josh Sparkes>it's good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13671-0
01:50:31.097 --> 01:50:41.251
<v Josh Sparkes>Right. I think the things we need to get.
Oh yeah, yeah, I'll do it this year.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13671-1
01:50:41.251 --> 01:50:50.377
<v Josh Sparkes>Both sides of my parents. Yeah, it's not.
That's mid. Yeah, well, not.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13685-0
01:50:50.977 --> 01:50:56.549
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a place in.
That was really quite rare. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13685-1
01:50:56.549 --> 01:51:04.391
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's because I don't really think
the last slide. Yeah, yeah, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13685-2
01:51:04.391 --> 01:51:07.177
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm breaking the chain now.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13709-0
01:51:08.377 --> 01:51:17.857
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, yeah, sweetie. All right. Yeah. Yeah.
Just like, I can slide on the fence.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13709-1
01:51:17.857 --> 01:51:27.097
<v Josh Sparkes>I can do it. Yeah. No. Do you guys, Bobby?
I don't know with myself. I like.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13742-0
01:51:27.297 --> 01:51:42.632
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm sorry. I need to. I need to.
I need to. I need to do a lot of things.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13742-1
01:51:42.632 --> 01:51:46.777
<v Josh Sparkes>So happy third line.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13775-0
01:51:46.817 --> 01:51:52.932
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, with the HSBC and the canal. Yeah,
I did go back for about five years and I</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13775-1
01:51:52.932 --> 01:51:57.555
<v Josh Sparkes>went back. You know, it's actually,
it's all right. Oh, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13775-2
01:51:57.555 --> 01:52:01.209
<v Josh Sparkes>But Brinley Place. Yeah,
that's quite nice. Now,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13775-3
01:52:01.209 --> 01:52:06.057
<v Josh Sparkes>isn't it along the canal? Yeah,
that's probably it. This is far.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13777-0
01:52:06.737 --> 01:52:07.577
<v Josh Sparkes>Or the winds.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13806-0
01:52:17.137 --> 01:52:20.467
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So that was the only thing that was</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13806-1
01:52:20.467 --> 01:52:26.336
<v Josh Sparkes>really. So that would be as well. Yeah.
And then it produces. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13806-2
01:52:26.336 --> 01:52:30.777
<v Josh Sparkes>Anything you say actually,
even though there are maybe,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13806-3
01:52:30.777 --> 01:52:35.377
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know Josh,
there's account on there for you even.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13818-0
01:52:37.137 --> 01:52:40.512
<v Josh Sparkes>What? Sorry. Thank you.
Thank you for always.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13818-1
01:52:40.512 --> 01:52:46.163
<v Josh Sparkes>What do you want to see a count of?
Just observed. Thank you for breaks. Oh,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13818-2
01:52:46.163 --> 01:52:46.897
<v Josh Sparkes>sorry. Um.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13820-0
01:52:49.817 --> 01:52:50.217
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13833-0
01:52:51.217 --> 01:52:57.377
<v Josh Sparkes>Some of them, not quite Mark, nearly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13827-0
01:52:52.737 --> 01:52:55.337
<v Mark Sedgey>Are we back on, Joshua? Not quite.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13832-0
01:52:57.737 --> 01:52:57.857
<v Mark Sedgey>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13850-0
01:53:03.617 --> 01:53:14.186
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that this is a side quest.
There's a there's a scenario to build a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13850-1
01:53:14.186 --> 01:53:19.977
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow. So that's an operating system.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13851-0
01:53:20.697 --> 01:53:21.257
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13856-0
01:53:28.977 --> 01:53:39.668
<v Josh Sparkes>No, I'm sorry.
I don't think you're gonna ask if you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13856-1
01:53:39.668 --> 01:53:43.097
<v Josh Sparkes>wanted me to say.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13882-0
01:53:53.457 --> 01:54:00.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, no, it's not.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13891-0
01:54:13.057 --> 01:54:19.557
<v Josh Sparkes>And they want to wear it to their
patience panel,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13891-1
01:54:19.557 --> 01:54:26.057
<v Josh Sparkes>since they have a resolution.
What's the problem?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13891-2
01:54:26.057 --> 01:54:32.817
<v Josh Sparkes>If there's not the great part of it, yeah,
I'll be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13909-0
01:54:32.937 --> 01:54:51.297
<v Josh Sparkes>When we were doing this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13928-0
01:55:10.617 --> 01:55:17.937
<v Josh Sparkes>It's something that it's a it's the signs
you know.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13934-0
01:55:18.897 --> 01:55:25.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it would be on the document left.
I was thinking I'm sure that's good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13940-0
01:55:28.217 --> 01:55:29.857
<v Josh Sparkes>All right, Yep.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13947-0
01:55:41.777 --> 01:55:44.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Another minute, Mark,
everyone on the call.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13951-0
01:55:46.857 --> 01:55:49.297
<v Mark Sedgey>OK mate, just waiting. No worries.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13963-0
01:55:51.377 --> 01:55:55.817
<v Josh Sparkes>You can hear everyone in the room, Mark,
when they're speaking into mics.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13967-0
01:55:56.897 --> 01:55:57.977
<v Mark Sedgey>Say again?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13971-0
01:55:57.577 --> 01:56:00.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you hear everyone in the room?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13996-0
01:55:59.377 --> 01:56:02.783
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, reasonably well.
There's a there's a couple of times where,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13996-1
01:56:02.783 --> 01:56:06.653
<v Mark Sedgey>depending on how far someone's back from
the mic, we can't always hear it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/13996-2
01:56:06.653 --> 01:56:07.737
<v Mark Sedgey>but it's pretty good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14015-0
01:56:07.737 --> 01:56:10.289
<v Josh Sparkes>All right,
my my teams didn't show that we're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14015-1
01:56:10.289 --> 01:56:13.451
<v Josh Sparkes>connected to the mic,
which is why we delayed the staff.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14015-2
01:56:13.451 --> 01:56:15.337
<v Josh Sparkes>It seems like it is connected, so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14017-0
01:56:14.337 --> 01:56:16.497
<v Mark Sedgey>OK, well, it certainly is cause.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14048-0
01:56:21.097 --> 01:56:28.434
<v Josh Sparkes>All good. Yeah. OK.
I have now maybe I don't know this order</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14048-1
01:56:28.434 --> 01:56:37.697
<v Josh Sparkes>timekeeper and rates maintenance next.
Now you might say well actually that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14109-0
01:56:38.177 --> 01:56:41.061
<v Josh Sparkes>Might be captured prior to client
onboarding,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14109-1
01:56:41.061 --> 01:56:45.637
<v Josh Sparkes>but you've got some activity here.
What did I say with the count of nine</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14109-2
01:56:45.637 --> 01:56:50.652
<v Josh Sparkes>processes with here and it could be as we
were just discussing one process with</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14109-3
01:56:50.652 --> 01:56:55.605
<v Josh Sparkes>scenarios that come off it, you know,
so the rules that if you enter this then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14109-4
01:56:55.605 --> 01:56:57.737
<v Josh Sparkes>there's certain other fields that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14142-0
01:56:58.177 --> 01:57:05.136
<v Josh Sparkes>Appear, but maybe a good starting point.
Maybe just share sort of the overarching</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14142-1
01:57:05.136 --> 01:57:09.719
<v Josh Sparkes>timekeeper.
So this is the creation of new timekeeper</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14142-2
01:57:09.719 --> 01:57:14.217
<v Josh Sparkes>rates plus its maintenance or updates
based on that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14195-0
01:57:14.417 --> 01:57:19.062
<v Josh Sparkes>Client that's been on boarded,
is that correct? Is that a good summary?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14195-1
01:57:19.062 --> 01:57:22.934
<v Josh Sparkes>Pretty much, yes.
So each every CIMA in the company working</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14195-2
01:57:22.934 --> 01:57:27.193
<v Josh Sparkes>on an e-booking client,
we have to log their details and profiles</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14195-3
01:57:27.193 --> 01:57:32.355
<v Josh Sparkes>in the client portal and it has to be
arrayed as well and that has to be agreed</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14195-4
01:57:32.355 --> 01:57:34.097
<v Josh Sparkes>and approved by the client.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14226-0
01:57:34.337 --> 01:57:37.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Partners down to legal analysts,
paralegals.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14226-1
01:57:37.337 --> 01:57:42.003
<v Josh Sparkes>Everyone has to have a red box.
If we don't have it in the system and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14226-2
01:57:42.003 --> 01:57:47.070
<v Josh Sparkes>it's approved with an effective date as
well, the invoice will be rejected.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14226-3
01:57:47.070 --> 01:57:50.737
<v Josh Sparkes>So any time keepers working on the
monitor we have to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14267-0
01:57:50.817 --> 01:57:54.389
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
So as part of you effectively get a new</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14267-1
01:57:54.389 --> 01:57:59.343
<v Josh Sparkes>request, would you,
is it or is it an internal activity from</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14267-2
01:57:59.343 --> 01:58:03.971
<v Josh Sparkes>yourselves associated?
So we've got our timekeeper rates</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14267-3
01:58:03.971 --> 01:58:07.057
<v Josh Sparkes>maintenance process which we're doing.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14307-0
01:58:07.457 --> 01:58:10.271
<v Josh Sparkes>Monthly,
every two weeks and we're capturing</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14307-1
01:58:10.271 --> 01:58:15.400
<v Josh Sparkes>reporting from 3D all the need to all the
new chunks of reported time on a matter</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14307-2
01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:20.278
<v Josh Sparkes>that haven't previously done in the last
month. So we'll look at that report.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14307-3
01:58:20.278 --> 01:58:22.217
<v Josh Sparkes>We then look into a automation.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14357-0
01:58:22.697 --> 01:58:26.609
<v Josh Sparkes>What that we have and it verifies that
data against the portal data,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14357-1
01:58:26.609 --> 01:58:30.918
<v Josh Sparkes>spits it out and tells us what planning
things we need to upload. Very new.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14357-2
01:58:30.918 --> 01:58:35.000
<v Josh Sparkes>It's only happened this year,
which is super exciting that we can do it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14357-3
01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.479
<v Josh Sparkes>actively rather than reactively. Yeah,
historically we would only get notified</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14357-4
01:58:39.479 --> 01:58:41.577
<v Josh Sparkes>if we attempted to upload an invoice.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14410-0
01:58:41.977 --> 01:58:46.328
<v Josh Sparkes>And it would get rejected going.
This time it doesn't have the approved</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14410-1
01:58:46.328 --> 01:58:49.047
<v Josh Sparkes>rate.
So we have to submit those every year.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14410-2
01:58:49.047 --> 01:58:52.733
<v Josh Sparkes>When at the end is matricular when they
move up their ranks,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14410-3
01:58:52.733 --> 01:58:56.540
<v Josh Sparkes>the new rate has to go in as standard
rates change every year,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14410-4
01:58:56.540 --> 01:59:00.286
<v Josh Sparkes>so they have to be updated.
If there's a new panel agreement,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14410-5
01:59:00.286 --> 01:59:01.737
<v Josh Sparkes>they have to be updated.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14442-0
01:59:02.297 --> 01:59:08.895
<v Josh Sparkes>But it sounds like and so do you have the
timekeeper, timekeeper rates?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14442-1
01:59:08.895 --> 01:59:13.661
<v Josh Sparkes>Can I assume that that is one?
That's one activity.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14442-2
01:59:13.661 --> 01:59:18.977
<v Josh Sparkes>You can assume it's one process,
so create new or update.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14479-0
01:59:20.217 --> 01:59:26.318
<v Josh Sparkes>In the system, Yeah. OK.
And is there consistently that level,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14479-1
01:59:26.318 --> 01:59:31.064
<v Josh Sparkes>as you say,
from partner to associate to junior,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14479-2
01:59:31.064 --> 01:59:38.522
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a standard terminology that all your
clients are the same on each point</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14479-3
01:59:38.522 --> 01:59:39.297
<v Josh Sparkes>towards?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14528-0
01:59:39.417 --> 01:59:44.723
<v Josh Sparkes>Technologists and clients will call
associates that and then they'll have</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14528-1
01:59:44.723 --> 01:59:49.312
<v Josh Sparkes>lawyers or they'll be see differentiates
for senior associates.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14528-2
01:59:49.312 --> 01:59:54.618
<v Josh Sparkes>We have sort of this other category which
includes technologists, legals,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14528-3
01:59:54.618 --> 01:59:58.777
<v Josh Sparkes>legal managers.
Each client will refer to the difference.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14592-0
01:59:59.057 --> 02:00:03.881
<v Josh Sparkes>So we need to know what they will accept
and accept, because if we do it wrong,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14592-1
02:00:03.881 --> 02:00:08.464
<v Josh Sparkes>they can reject it or they can approve it.
And then if we've done it wrong,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14592-2
02:00:08.464 --> 02:00:13.530
<v Josh Sparkes>then they want to submit it in the system.
It's locked in for the next year, right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14592-3
02:00:13.530 --> 02:00:16.846
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, so it's locked.
So then long enough that once it's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14592-4
02:00:16.846 --> 02:00:18.897
<v Josh Sparkes>uploaded, it's locked essentially.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14640-0
02:00:19.257 --> 02:00:24.429
<v Josh Sparkes>A few clients it's locked in,
some of the other clients a little bit</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14640-1
02:00:24.429 --> 02:00:29.826
<v Josh Sparkes>more flexible. OK, so on that.
So if you'd say for someone requests new</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14640-2
02:00:29.826 --> 02:00:34.099
<v Josh Sparkes>timekeeper rates,
would it be safe to say that you would</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14640-3
02:00:34.099 --> 02:00:38.297
<v Josh Sparkes>then have your again your parents client
equals active?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14671-0
02:00:38.657 --> 02:00:45.357
<v Josh Sparkes>That I've set up,
then you would start adding these rates</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14671-1
02:00:45.357 --> 02:00:52.058
<v Josh Sparkes>per hourly rate.
So that will go in and would would it be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14671-2
02:00:52.058 --> 02:00:56.217
<v Josh Sparkes>helpful, as you said, if you took a?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14702-0
02:00:56.657 --> 02:00:59.322
<v Josh Sparkes>Of course,
if you took all the terms of these rates</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14702-1
02:00:59.322 --> 02:01:03.576
<v Josh Sparkes>and as you said across all the different
lines, there might be 20 different names,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14702-2
02:01:03.576 --> 02:01:06.857
<v Josh Sparkes>will it be then useful as recommendations
as now to have those?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14737-0
02:01:07.857 --> 02:01:13.796
<v Josh Sparkes>Legal to associate to to get some
consistency of language that you can then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14737-1
02:01:13.796 --> 02:01:17.312
<v Josh Sparkes>upload.
So with this it won't necessarily be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14737-2
02:01:17.312 --> 02:01:23.017
<v Josh Sparkes>request done with the business.
This is more of an internal reaction to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14772-0
02:01:23.617 --> 02:01:29.119
<v Josh Sparkes>The request upload, yeah,
or if it'll be the planking manager.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14772-1
02:01:29.119 --> 02:01:34.273
<v Josh Sparkes>So it wouldn't be the PE partner or
anyone in the program.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14772-2
02:01:34.273 --> 02:01:39.076
<v Josh Sparkes>We need to update our rates. Yeah,
it's down. Yes. OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14772-3
02:01:39.076 --> 02:01:41.697
<v Josh Sparkes>So we would that be from Rama?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14809-0
02:01:41.777 --> 02:01:45.043
<v Josh Sparkes>No, no.
So it's just something that you actively</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14809-1
02:01:45.043 --> 02:01:48.377
<v Josh Sparkes>manage.
It will come from us attempting to submit</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14809-2
02:01:48.377 --> 02:01:53.577
<v Josh Sparkes>an invoice and it be rejected or it comes
from the timekeeper rights process,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14809-3
02:01:53.577 --> 02:01:55.177
<v Josh Sparkes>maintenance process, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14863-0
02:01:55.217 --> 02:01:58.957
<v Mark Sedgey>Just so sorry team,
just thinking that one or listening that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14813-0
02:01:55.257 --> 02:01:55.297
<v Josh Sparkes>A.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14863-1
02:01:58.957 --> 02:02:03.802
<v Mark Sedgey>one through the the if we were to target
removing that reactive piece that you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14863-2
02:02:03.802 --> 02:02:07.114
<v Mark Sedgey>invoice something and you've got some
failure demand,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14863-3
02:02:07.114 --> 02:02:11.836
<v Mark Sedgey>what was the what did you say was the
other mechanism that rates get agreed?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14863-4
02:02:11.836 --> 02:02:13.737
<v Mark Sedgey>Is there not a logical trigger?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14877-0
02:02:14.737 --> 02:02:17.989
<v Mark Sedgey>From there,
that just gives you a task that we could</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14928-0
02:02:17.297 --> 02:02:22.496
<v Josh Sparkes>This is what this is what we've replaced
the timekeeper rates maintenance space.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14877-1
02:02:17.989 --> 02:02:20.137
<v Mark Sedgey>sort of leverage to give us a task.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14928-1
02:02:22.496 --> 02:02:27.310
<v Josh Sparkes>So we don't get informed every time
there's a new rate or a new timekeeper</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14928-2
02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:30.520
<v Josh Sparkes>logging time.
It will be on this timekeeper rates</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14928-3
02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:35.783
<v Josh Sparkes>maintenance that will call the report of
all the people that are working on these</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14928-4
02:02:35.783 --> 02:02:36.297
<v Josh Sparkes>clients.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14967-0
02:02:36.737 --> 02:02:39.785
<v Josh Sparkes>And this is at the moment,
it's only for a certain group.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14967-1
02:02:39.785 --> 02:02:42.834
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got 20 clients that we're working
on at the moment,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14967-2
02:02:42.834 --> 02:02:46.513
<v Josh Sparkes>but the aim is to get it rolled out by
the end of the year financial.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14950-0
02:02:44.657 --> 02:02:45.097
<v Mark Sedgey>Right, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14967-3
02:02:46.513 --> 02:02:50.876
<v Josh Sparkes>So you do this proactively on the back of
that timekeeper rates report that you've</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/14967-4
02:02:50.876 --> 02:02:51.297
<v Josh Sparkes>handled.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15015-0
02:02:51.777 --> 02:02:55.893
<v Josh Sparkes>Which currently which are migrating all
of them. Yeah, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15015-1
02:02:55.893 --> 02:03:00.347
<v Josh Sparkes>the ones that we can do,
there's one more tool that is completely</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15015-2
02:03:00.347 --> 02:03:04.058
<v Josh Sparkes>known that we can't,
but everything else will. OK, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15015-3
02:03:04.058 --> 02:03:09.052
<v Josh Sparkes>And so on the back of that you would then
recall potentially as you said,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15015-4
02:03:09.052 --> 02:03:10.537
<v Josh Sparkes>this is internal this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15059-0
02:03:10.737 --> 02:03:14.162
<v Josh Sparkes>In sense there will be your activity
being logged,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15059-1
02:03:14.162 --> 02:03:18.327
<v Josh Sparkes>the fact that you've created a new or
changed existing. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15059-2
02:03:18.327 --> 02:03:23.432
<v Josh Sparkes>So what would happen is I run the process,
it's it's out all these reports,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15059-3
02:03:23.432 --> 02:03:28.605
<v Josh Sparkes>I then send them individually a client
and then the SME will pick them up to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15059-4
02:03:28.605 --> 02:03:30.217
<v Josh Sparkes>then upload those rates.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15061-0
02:03:30.937 --> 02:03:34.417
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, yeah, that's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15112-0
02:03:35.697 --> 02:03:38.299
<v Josh Sparkes>So you send them,
let me just go back to the new,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15112-1
02:03:38.299 --> 02:03:41.110
<v Josh Sparkes>you agree the rates, you get the rates,
you enter it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15112-2
02:03:41.110 --> 02:03:45.325
<v Josh Sparkes>then you give them to just tell me who
they've been sent to. The team, the team,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15112-3
02:03:45.325 --> 02:03:48.760
<v Josh Sparkes>because we break it up by client.
So you have just Goldman Sachs,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15112-4
02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:52.976
<v Josh Sparkes>you submit Goldman Sachs rates because
they're very familiar with it and they'll</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15112-5
02:03:52.976 --> 02:03:53.497
<v Josh Sparkes>know what.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15145-0
02:03:53.937 --> 02:04:00.474
<v Josh Sparkes>Rank we need to use for and you have that
skills metrics defined,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15145-1
02:04:00.474 --> 02:04:06.714
<v Josh Sparkes>you know each of you.
So in the background we will get to that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15145-2
02:04:06.714 --> 02:04:10.577
<v Josh Sparkes>that based on this, it's Glasgow, it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15137-0
02:04:09.297 --> 02:04:09.817
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15174-0
02:04:10.897 --> 02:04:15.362
<v Mark Sedgey>And do you do you have like a QA check
once you've changed those rates just to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15174-1
02:04:15.362 --> 02:04:19.545
<v Mark Sedgey>somebody look over the shoulder,
just check the data's right so you don't</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15174-2
02:04:19.545 --> 02:04:21.297
<v Mark Sedgey>get invoice failure downstream?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15190-0
02:04:20.737 --> 02:04:24.786
<v Josh Sparkes>I normally do it initially before I send
the reports out to the team,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15190-1
02:04:24.786 --> 02:04:28.257
<v Josh Sparkes>so I'll check that that rate matches up
with our rate card.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15193-0
02:04:29.057 --> 02:04:30.897
<v Mark Sedgey>Gotcha. OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15227-0
02:04:30.417 --> 02:04:34.687
<v Josh Sparkes>And if it's wrong,
then I'll go back to Rama and share if</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15227-1
02:04:34.687 --> 02:04:39.914
<v Josh Sparkes>it's going for a different rate.
So we're going back to the beginning,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15227-2
02:04:39.914 --> 02:04:44.700
<v Josh Sparkes>getting that over, if that's OK.
So recommendation is that we've</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15227-3
02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:45.657
<v Josh Sparkes>consolidated.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15276-0
02:04:46.177 --> 02:04:50.124
<v Josh Sparkes>But not trivialised. Again,
I don't want to think that just because</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15276-1
02:04:50.124 --> 02:04:54.826
<v Josh Sparkes>it says one name that it doesn't imply
that there's lots of work associated with</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15276-2
02:04:54.826 --> 02:04:57.206
<v Josh Sparkes>it.
So you've got this timekeeping rates</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15276-3
02:04:57.206 --> 02:05:02.024
<v Josh Sparkes>maintenance that you will be doing as an
internal you effectively in ServiceNow as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15276-4
02:05:02.024 --> 02:05:02.257
<v Josh Sparkes>one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15312-0
02:05:02.457 --> 02:05:07.967
<v Josh Sparkes>Service. Is that fair to say?
That would be our recommendation. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15312-1
02:05:07.967 --> 02:05:11.981
<v Josh Sparkes>that's good.
And then from that it could be new or</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15312-2
02:05:11.981 --> 02:05:17.334
<v Josh Sparkes>amended. Is there another scenario?
Do you really reject or remove?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15312-3
02:05:17.334 --> 02:05:22.057
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we've rejected it would be a
notification from the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15371-0
02:05:22.257 --> 02:05:26.128
<v Josh Sparkes>If we submit the rates in client,
then we'll approve or reject and that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15371-1
02:05:26.128 --> 02:05:29.032
<v Josh Sparkes>notification comes to us.
So if it's approved, great,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15371-2
02:05:29.032 --> 02:05:33.495
<v Josh Sparkes>we can upload our invoice if there is an
invoice attached to it. If it's rejected,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15371-3
02:05:33.495 --> 02:05:37.743
<v Josh Sparkes>we have to then look at it, analyze it.
If the client's given us notes, great.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15371-4
02:05:37.743 --> 02:05:41.937
<v Josh Sparkes>If not, we have to then backtrack,
try and figure out why it's been rejected.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15419-0
02:05:41.937 --> 02:05:48.080
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've got a root cause analysis part
of that. OK, and is that a triage?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15419-1
02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:52.930
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that a freeze?
It could be standard reasons why you have</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15419-2
02:05:52.930 --> 02:05:58.749
<v Josh Sparkes>that rejection sometimes. I mean,
I'm just thinking that you can report</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15419-3
02:05:58.749 --> 02:06:01.417
<v Josh Sparkes>upon it rather than free texting.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15462-0
02:06:01.617 --> 02:06:06.012
<v Josh Sparkes>We didn't have these fees in ServiceNow
and recommendation that you know if it's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15462-1
02:06:06.012 --> 02:06:08.888
<v Josh Sparkes>this particular level one rejected,
it's just right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15462-2
02:06:08.888 --> 02:06:13.338
<v Josh Sparkes>But you want to be from the client or the
client portal. So we're not don't have,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15462-3
02:06:13.338 --> 02:06:17.300
<v Josh Sparkes>you're not Privy to that one. OK,
can I just ask a quick question on the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15462-4
02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:17.897
<v Josh Sparkes>rate count?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15499-0
02:06:18.177 --> 02:06:21.561
<v Josh Sparkes>And where is that master here?
What is that in?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15499-1
02:06:21.561 --> 02:06:24.663
<v Josh Sparkes>That's in the rates folder.
The Rama teams,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15499-2
02:06:24.663 --> 02:06:27.906
<v Josh Sparkes>the rates administration team manager
folder.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15499-3
02:06:27.906 --> 02:06:33.617
<v Josh Sparkes>They have all their rate cards within
that within that. So then it gets into 38.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15531-0
02:06:33.697 --> 02:06:38.497
<v Josh Sparkes>But we look at the PDF version.
So see we're dealing with multi</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15531-1
02:06:38.497 --> 02:06:43.447
<v Josh Sparkes>currencies. Yeah, right.
So see he would have the rate counts and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15531-2
02:06:43.447 --> 02:06:48.022
<v Josh Sparkes>the exchange rates. Oh,
the exchange rates are done monthly,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15531-3
02:06:48.022 --> 02:06:49.897
<v Josh Sparkes>so they wouldn't have it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15553-0
02:06:50.177 --> 02:06:54.757
<v Josh Sparkes>Drill down like that,
it would be depends on the client.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15553-1
02:06:54.757 --> 02:06:59.257
<v Josh Sparkes>Normally it would be done by the
timekeeper's location.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15562-0
02:07:01.297 --> 02:07:06.857
<v Josh Sparkes>The home office and has that default.
Yeah, yeah, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15597-0
02:07:08.097 --> 02:07:14.674
<v Josh Sparkes>So the initial view that was a scheduled
request and I think the response was no,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15597-1
02:07:14.674 --> 02:07:21.092
<v Josh Sparkes>but I'm getting a sense that you could
schedule a lot of this activity based on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15597-2
02:07:21.092 --> 02:07:23.017
<v Josh Sparkes>that report that you're.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15621-0
02:07:24.737 --> 02:07:28.011
<v Josh Sparkes>The thing is that has, yeah,
it's only for its maintenance,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15621-1
02:07:28.011 --> 02:07:32.048
<v Josh Sparkes>normally done the second week of the
month. So that's the scheduled. Yes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15621-2
02:07:32.048 --> 02:07:35.377
<v Josh Sparkes>that is mentioned there. Yeah, first one.
Yeah, that's good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15646-0
02:07:39.217 --> 02:07:43.798
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that from a schedule case and share
with him? No,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15646-1
02:07:43.798 --> 02:07:49.676
<v Josh Sparkes>but that would probably help to have a
prompt though to run it. No,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15646-2
02:07:49.676 --> 02:07:54.257
<v Josh Sparkes>I just at the moment it's just done.
It could go in.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15653-0
02:07:57.857 --> 02:07:59.897
<v Josh Sparkes>What would be the reasons for it not to
win?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15688-0
02:08:05.377 --> 02:08:14.075
<v Josh Sparkes>Another set of reports that you're
already managing. More traffic in your.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15688-1
02:08:14.075 --> 02:08:19.409
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, well,
remember we will be using Sharon.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15688-2
02:08:19.409 --> 02:08:21.497
<v Josh Sparkes>So the ServiceNow.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15739-0
02:08:22.177 --> 02:08:26.886
<v Josh Sparkes>I think for me it feels like a schedule
case that then prompts the report to be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15739-1
02:08:26.886 --> 02:08:29.770
<v Josh Sparkes>run and where do you run the report from
Lauren?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15739-2
02:08:29.770 --> 02:08:34.596
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you pull that from different sources?
And does that go into a spreadsheet just</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15739-3
02:08:34.596 --> 02:08:38.128
<v Josh Sparkes>now for you? Yeah,
I have to pull those to you guys to dump</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15739-4
02:08:38.128 --> 02:08:40.777
<v Josh Sparkes>into a spreadsheet and then put it into
the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15784-0
02:08:46.897 --> 02:08:50.857
<v Josh Sparkes>So we do have a bot.
That's that's the new process, isn't it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15784-1
02:08:50.857 --> 02:08:54.052
<v Josh Sparkes>Lauren?
It's just we've got there is AI that does</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15784-2
02:08:54.052 --> 02:08:58.012
<v Josh Sparkes>a piece of work around that on the
spreadsheet at the moment.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15784-3
02:08:58.012 --> 02:09:00.057
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not sure how that will work.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15824-0
02:09:01.057 --> 02:09:04.290
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I just pull the two spreadsheets and then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15824-1
02:09:04.290 --> 02:09:09.208
<v Josh Sparkes>you can, yeah, compare. Yeah.
And then if what does the what doesn't be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15824-2
02:09:09.208 --> 02:09:13.991
<v Josh Sparkes>I wonder if it's worth demoing.
Is that something you would be able to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15824-3
02:09:13.991 --> 02:09:17.697
<v Josh Sparkes>demo on? I don't mean right mistaken,
but I just mean.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15852-0
02:09:17.777 --> 02:09:20.154
<v Josh Sparkes>Could you show how that works and how the
bot runs,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15852-1
02:09:20.154 --> 02:09:23.811
<v Josh Sparkes>'cause it very good to see what that
looks like. Yeah, it would be good to see.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15852-2
02:09:23.811 --> 02:09:26.051
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I understand that if there's some sort of,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15852-3
02:09:26.051 --> 02:09:29.297
<v Josh Sparkes>particularly if there's a scheduling on
the back of that, it could be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15874-0
02:09:30.257 --> 02:09:34.942
<v Josh Sparkes>Schedules that to run and then compares
and then you get the rates and then you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15874-1
02:09:34.942 --> 02:09:37.988
<v Josh Sparkes>get the difference.
Effectively it's outputting the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15874-2
02:09:37.988 --> 02:09:40.097
<v Josh Sparkes>differences that you need to update.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15914-0
02:09:41.457 --> 02:09:44.992
<v Josh Sparkes>It's probably a question of do we
actually need to replicate it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15914-1
02:09:44.992 --> 02:09:47.821
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know,
but it may be worth you seeing how it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15914-2
02:09:47.821 --> 02:09:51.737
<v Josh Sparkes>works and what it looks like,
or if you can even get it talking to each</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15914-3
02:09:51.737 --> 02:09:54.457
<v Josh Sparkes>other. It's just if there's a need,
I'm not sure.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15920-0
02:09:56.337 --> 02:10:00.615
<v Josh Sparkes>But you would obviously still want to
point everything that you're doing in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15920-1
02:10:00.615 --> 02:10:00.897
<v Josh Sparkes>here.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15937-0
02:10:01.897 --> 02:10:05.931
<v Josh Sparkes>And how many, what percent,
how many are you doing a month?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15937-1
02:10:05.931 --> 02:10:09.697
<v Josh Sparkes>So how many about 20 clients for doing
the environment?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15942-0
02:10:14.097 --> 02:10:19.657
<v Josh Sparkes>It's got the hundreds.
I'm keeper rates to upload each time.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15989-0
02:10:20.817 --> 02:10:25.325
<v Josh Sparkes>Each each month that other actually.
So that's a a change or a new or a change.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15989-1
02:10:25.325 --> 02:10:29.213
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh yes, I would change it.
So I would have moved off around and then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15989-2
02:10:29.213 --> 02:10:33.946
<v Josh Sparkes>need to speak and try or a completely new
time to keep the person to actually speak</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15989-3
02:10:33.946 --> 02:10:36.257
<v Josh Sparkes>to the client and we need to submit that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/15994-0
02:10:36.257 --> 02:10:38.817
<v Josh Sparkes>Twice. OK. That's it. Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16005-0
02:10:40.817 --> 02:10:44.007
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not part of.
I'll put that on the on things for them</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16005-1
02:10:44.007 --> 02:10:44.777
<v Josh Sparkes>if they won't.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16016-0
02:10:45.897 --> 02:10:48.728
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
so the whole scheduling point if you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16016-1
02:10:48.728 --> 02:10:50.177
<v Josh Sparkes>might be dependent on.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16040-0
02:10:51.137 --> 02:10:56.961
<v Josh Sparkes>How that looks. Let's refer back.
I think we can separate it out because</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16040-1
02:10:56.961 --> 02:11:03.343
<v Josh Sparkes>the timely maintenance is the starting
process in itself and then the other is,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16040-2
02:11:03.343 --> 02:11:05.577
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, that makes more sense.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16079-0
02:11:08.257 --> 02:11:12.545
<v Josh Sparkes>Potentially, yeah.
This is capturing the fact that you've</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16079-1
02:11:12.545 --> 02:11:18.607
<v Josh Sparkes>done that activity that's surviving. It's,
you know, in its first recommendation,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16079-2
02:11:18.607 --> 02:11:23.857
<v Josh Sparkes>you're capturing that they're new and
they're changes and the changes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16124-0
02:11:24.337 --> 02:11:28.719
<v Josh Sparkes>Can be proactive and reactive.
So you're reacting to a rejection,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16124-1
02:11:28.719 --> 02:11:32.636
<v Josh Sparkes>as Mark would say,
the trigger points you're rejecting to,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16124-2
02:11:32.636 --> 02:11:37.549
<v Josh Sparkes>you're reacting to a rejection,
which utopia would be actually those with</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16124-3
02:11:37.549 --> 02:11:40.537
<v Josh Sparkes>our good balances and checks that goes
away.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16155-0
02:11:40.897 --> 02:11:46.261
<v Josh Sparkes>So that this activity is a proactive new
and updating, as you said,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16155-1
02:11:46.261 --> 02:11:52.256
<v Josh Sparkes>new there's a new associate or new
journey associate or whoever comes on to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16155-2
02:11:52.256 --> 02:11:55.017
<v Josh Sparkes>add to the the feeling within that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16197-0
02:11:57.297 --> 02:12:02.853
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe that is a separate what we've just
discussed that the process in itself is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16197-1
02:12:02.853 --> 02:12:07.861
<v Josh Sparkes>something we can park for now,
but certainly our recommendations that we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16197-2
02:12:07.861 --> 02:12:11.977
<v Josh Sparkes>have this one form for the new and admin
and the scheduled.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16235-0
02:12:12.137 --> 02:12:17.393
<v Josh Sparkes>Ones would would trigger this as well.
That's OK for reporting. Yes, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16235-1
02:12:17.393 --> 02:12:21.948
<v Josh Sparkes>this would trigger. I mean,
it could be the placeholder. I mean,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16235-2
02:12:21.948 --> 02:12:26.714
<v Josh Sparkes>if it's something you have clients,
a bit like a recurring invoice,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16235-3
02:12:26.714 --> 02:12:29.097
<v Josh Sparkes>you have clients that do the same.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16293-0
02:12:29.577 --> 02:12:32.173
<v Josh Sparkes>Admin check.
Is there one particular time that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16293-1
02:12:32.173 --> 02:12:36.814
<v Josh Sparkes>actually every month there seems to be an
update and you know that it's going to be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16293-2
02:12:36.814 --> 02:12:40.570
<v Josh Sparkes>a recurring admin task for them? No,
just me. Is that possible? OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16293-3
02:12:40.570 --> 02:12:45.211
<v Josh Sparkes>because sometimes they could be scheduled
that you say it's recurring and therefore</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16293-4
02:12:45.211 --> 02:12:48.857
<v Josh Sparkes>it does it for you as a as an activity
and that could be created.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16326-0
02:12:48.977 --> 02:12:52.748
<v Josh Sparkes>But it doesn't sound that there's
recurring schedules.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16326-1
02:12:52.748 --> 02:12:56.588
<v Josh Sparkes>I would say that this is probably not
scheduled, is it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16326-2
02:12:56.588 --> 02:13:01.045
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't do it in that way.
It's still an activity with an SLA of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16326-3
02:13:01.045 --> 02:13:04.817
<v Josh Sparkes>like 30 days and you're doing it within
the month, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16339-0
02:13:06.017 --> 02:13:09.959
<v Josh Sparkes>So we're in the schedule bit when we're
it's a bit more descriptive, isn't it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16339-1
02:13:09.959 --> 02:13:11.457
<v Josh Sparkes>How do you want to capture it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16371-0
02:13:12.577 --> 02:13:17.695
<v Josh Sparkes>If we're we're consolidating all, yes,
we haven't got the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16371-1
02:13:17.695 --> 02:13:23.247
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're not scheduled.
They are the new or the change. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16371-2
02:13:23.247 --> 02:13:25.937
<v Josh Sparkes>I would just say that they are.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16374-0
02:13:26.977 --> 02:13:30.457
<v Josh Sparkes>They'll be ad fault.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16377-0
02:13:31.777 --> 02:13:33.457
<v Josh Sparkes>And probably.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16412-0
02:13:38.337 --> 02:13:46.430
<v Josh Sparkes>But can I also clarify that you might do
it straight after the client on boarding</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16412-1
02:13:46.430 --> 02:13:51.957
<v Josh Sparkes>as well? Yeah,
because that trigger a dependency, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16412-2
02:13:51.957 --> 02:13:55.017
<v Josh Sparkes>if it's more a regional office.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16458-0
02:13:55.377 --> 02:13:58.358
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's just that office can onboarding
the client,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16458-1
02:13:58.358 --> 02:14:02.858
<v Josh Sparkes>they will be able to provide us a list of
who's working with that client and we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16458-2
02:14:02.858 --> 02:14:06.965
<v Josh Sparkes>will do those right as initial step.
So because we have a global client,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16458-3
02:14:06.965 --> 02:14:10.228
<v Josh Sparkes>it's yeah, yeah,
I mean it could be that we if we go back</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16458-4
02:14:10.228 --> 02:14:13.097
<v Josh Sparkes>one for the form before I'll,
I'll update it, but.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16492-0
02:14:13.617 --> 02:14:17.450
<v Josh Sparkes>If new clients,
it could trigger the time keep away</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16492-1
02:14:17.450 --> 02:14:23.052
<v Josh Sparkes>process and therefore automatically
creates the new request of it's in your</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16492-2
02:14:23.052 --> 02:14:27.180
<v Josh Sparkes>schedules activities.
That's something we can do. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16492-3
02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:29.097
<v Josh Sparkes>which exit trigger of the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16508-0
02:14:29.297 --> 02:14:35.161
<v Josh Sparkes>Previous crying involving certain person
activities been triggers. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16508-1
02:14:35.161 --> 02:14:39.017
<v Josh Sparkes>do you want to record that as a as a
notes and.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16516-0
02:14:41.777 --> 02:14:45.737
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I still wanna mess with the format,
but yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16558-0
02:14:47.137 --> 02:14:52.572
<v Josh Sparkes>And then your assignment for that could
be with again with your skills matrix can</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16558-1
02:14:52.572 --> 02:14:57.874
<v Josh Sparkes>be assigned to will it go back maybe to
the same person that's doing the client</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16558-2
02:14:57.874 --> 02:15:01.719
<v Josh Sparkes>on boarding? Yeah,
it could be any other person who doing</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16558-3
02:15:01.719 --> 02:15:05.497
<v Josh Sparkes>the boarding will do the best invoice and
then order it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16617-0
02:15:06.057 --> 02:15:10.767
<v Josh Sparkes>Process notes for the client and then it
gets banded over well to the rest of the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16617-1
02:15:10.767 --> 02:15:13.755
<v Josh Sparkes>team, right.
And then that will get assigned in the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16617-2
02:15:13.755 --> 02:15:18.236
<v Josh Sparkes>skills nutrition who's going to pick up.
OK, good. Cool to trigger. OK, good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16617-3
02:15:18.236 --> 02:15:22.659
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you. OK. On the portal visibility,
what I'm taking from is it could be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16617-4
02:15:22.659 --> 02:15:25.417
<v Josh Sparkes>triggered by by that means from the
onboarding.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16644-0
02:15:25.857 --> 02:15:33.965
<v Josh Sparkes>But it could also be ad hocs of you guys,
but only be you guys trigger in that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16644-1
02:15:33.965 --> 02:15:40.857
<v Josh Sparkes>But we are just making a point of
recording your team for instance.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16654-0
02:15:41.617 --> 02:15:47.817
<v Josh Sparkes>We've had it recently and client they're
just under any rate agreement, so it was.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16697-0
02:15:48.497 --> 02:15:53.240
<v Josh Sparkes>Commercial finance because then you're in
the rate agreement that when negotiating</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16697-1

everyone is new rate card,</v>

02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:01.240
<v Josh Sparkes>this needs to get put in the system.
That would be the only instance that we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16697-3
02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:04.097
<v Josh Sparkes>have it internally that we need to update
a rate.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16732-0

<v Josh Sparkes>our commercial financing with then
negotiating a new panel with our client</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16732-2

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16732-3
02:16:15.974 --> 02:16:20.617
<v Josh Sparkes>need to go in the building and they need
to be updated. So that that's a by them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16738-0
02:16:20.977 --> 02:16:24.297
<v Josh Sparkes>Uh huh. Um, that would be the only.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16739-0
02:16:26.057 --> 02:16:26.777
<v Josh Sparkes>Not just.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16759-0

02:16:32.356 --> 02:16:35.999
<v Josh Sparkes>And they might do that more,
but it's not one or the that's part of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16759-2
02:16:35.999 --> 02:16:36.857
<v Josh Sparkes>their processes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16799-0
02:16:39.137 --> 02:16:44.297
<v Josh Sparkes>Certain clients, yes. OK.
So it could be that they're the people</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16799-1
02:16:44.297 --> 02:16:50.648
<v Josh Sparkes>that see it front facing on the portal
and that they can revise that's and keep</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16799-2
02:16:50.648 --> 02:16:54.777
<v Josh Sparkes>the rights to you. Yeah,

<v Josh Sparkes>earners are in the system because we
planning to invoice. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16833-2
02:17:02.182 --> 02:17:05.618
<v Josh Sparkes>so being a scenario very involved between
the table. So once,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16833-3
02:17:05.618 --> 02:17:09.665
<v Josh Sparkes>once or twice have received that request.
Yeah, just go into the system,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16833-4
02:17:09.665 --> 02:17:11.217
<v Josh Sparkes>make sure these fee earners.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16847-0
02:17:11.217 --> 02:17:16.072
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, they're asking to check.
They're they're asking to see if they're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16847-1
02:17:16.072 --> 02:17:19.817
<v Josh Sparkes>already there.
Did they ever ask to upload? Yeah, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16891-0
02:17:23.217 --> 02:17:26.607
<v Josh Sparkes>Just the upload says sorry,
but it can't be uploaded today.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16891-1
02:17:26.607 --> 02:17:29.319
<v Josh Sparkes>I need to sit with the timekeepers first.
Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16891-2
02:17:29.319 --> 02:17:32.088
<v Josh Sparkes>we just got to make sure that they are in
ready.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16891-3
02:17:32.088 --> 02:17:36.043
<v Josh Sparkes>But do they ever ask to upload from
scratch? Ask to add from scratch?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16891-4
02:17:36.043 --> 02:17:38.417
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can request your upload and then I.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16955-0
02:17:38.497 --> 02:17:43.052
<v Josh Sparkes>I realize that I can't upload because
timekeepers aren't in certain checks with</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16955-1
02:17:43.052 --> 02:17:47.437
<v Josh Sparkes>some clients that we do also directly
just to make sure that the timekeepers</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16955-2
02:17:47.437 --> 02:17:51.195
<v Josh Sparkes>are in before uploading. Yeah,
so that we can prevent unnecessary</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16955-3
02:17:51.195 --> 02:17:55.637
<v Josh Sparkes>rejection and I will see the type of
response in yet because maybe the report</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16927-0
02:17:51.737 --> 02:17:51.857
<v Mark Sedgey>Yep.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16955-4
02:17:55.637 --> 02:17:58.257
<v Josh Sparkes>alone is run between the time it's being
run.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16963-0
02:18:00.297 --> 02:18:02.577
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I see. OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16989-0
02:18:01.697 --> 02:18:06.026
<v Mark Sedgey>So is that is that something that they
how do they ask you to do that check?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/16989-1
02:18:06.026 --> 02:18:09.737
<v Mark Sedgey>Do they just ring up or do they send an
e-mail say can you check?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17011-0
02:18:10.257 --> 02:18:16.320
<v Josh Sparkes>And to send an e-mail and say,
can you please do check that ABMCRE</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17052-0
02:18:14.497 --> 02:18:17.910
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, OK. So there could be,
there could be like a data check or we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17011-1
02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:17.497
<v Josh Sparkes>report? Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17052-1
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:21.926
<v Mark Sedgey>could create a very simple request item
so that you can track how many of those</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17052-2
02:18:21.926 --> 02:18:24.636
<v Mark Sedgey>you get, whether it's common,
whether it's, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17052-3
02:18:24.636 --> 02:18:27.799
<v Mark Sedgey>do you know what I mean?
So you can get some insight into that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17052-4
02:18:27.799 --> 02:18:31.965
<v Mark Sedgey>just via like a data check and then they
can tick box that what what is it they're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17052-5
02:18:31.965 --> 02:18:32.417
<v Mark Sedgey>checking.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17060-0
02:18:33.417 --> 02:18:38.137
<v Mark Sedgey>And then that will give you the ability
to capture and track that work demand.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17118-0
02:18:39.857 --> 02:18:42.191
<v Josh Sparkes>I was,
I was thinking Mark more because it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17118-1
02:18:42.191 --> 02:18:45.992
<v Josh Sparkes>sounds like there's just one a few,
one or two of them that check it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17118-2
02:18:45.992 --> 02:18:48.435
<v Josh Sparkes>whereas everyone could check,
couldn't they?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17118-3
02:18:48.435 --> 02:18:51.095
<v Josh Sparkes>You could be innovative to say have you
done it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17118-4
02:18:51.095 --> 02:18:55.276
<v Josh Sparkes>So all this is part of a process that you
go through so that to remove those</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17118-5
02:18:55.276 --> 02:18:59.457
<v Josh Sparkes>questions that they feel confident that
they're in. So Mark, I was thinking.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17147-0
02:18:59.537 --> 02:19:04.483
<v Josh Sparkes>Not building it into a request or a check,
but it's actually within its own process</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17147-1
02:19:04.483 --> 02:19:08.959
<v Josh Sparkes>as you're going through client onboarding
and the rates check and they feel</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17180-0
02:19:07.057 --> 02:19:11.308
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, but I thought, yeah, no, I yeah,
I understood that bit.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17147-2
02:19:08.959 --> 02:19:10.137
<v Josh Sparkes>confident not to us.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17180-1
02:19:11.308 --> 02:19:16.588
<v Mark Sedgey>I thought there was a chance that there
through an overlap of a report being</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17180-2
02:19:16.588 --> 02:19:22.005
<v Mark Sedgey>generated and adding that there might be
a smaller subset demand that's that's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17180-3
02:19:22.005 --> 02:19:22.417
<v Mark Sedgey>where.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17211-0
02:19:22.977 --> 02:19:27.400
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, they can't. If it's not on there,
will they ask for it sort of kind of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17211-1
02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:30.847
<v Mark Sedgey>thing or will they just request a check?
Unless I misheard,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17211-2
02:19:30.847 --> 02:19:33.777
<v Mark Sedgey>I thought there was a report ran and then
if it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17207-0
02:19:32.377 --> 02:19:33.097
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17256-0
02:19:34.897 --> 02:19:39.917
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that's correct.
It comes from the overlaps, doesn't it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17256-1
02:19:39.917 --> 02:19:46.394
<v Josh Sparkes>The time of running it and between the
time of running it and the time of doing</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17238-0
02:19:44.217 --> 02:19:44.497
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17256-2
02:19:46.394 --> 02:19:51.252
<v Josh Sparkes>it, the update. Yeah,
just been checking if if I want, yes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17251-0
02:19:49.897 --> 02:19:50.017
<v Mark Sedgey>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17256-3
02:19:51.252 --> 02:19:51.657
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17280-0
02:19:51.857 --> 02:19:54.641
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I just wonder whether that's the general.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17280-1
02:19:54.641 --> 02:19:58.063
<v Josh Sparkes>Where do we capture it as a query?
Is it part of this one?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17280-2
02:19:58.063 --> 02:20:01.949
<v Josh Sparkes>It's part of the admin.
Maybe you want to have a look at it. Mark,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17280-3
02:20:01.949 --> 02:20:05.777
<v Josh Sparkes>if you don't mind part of the general
admin request that you get.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17283-0
02:20:07.977 --> 02:20:11.257
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, all right. Yep. Want to follow up? Um.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17295-0
02:20:13.137 --> 02:20:15.609
<v Josh Sparkes>One second. Yeah,
we'll put that like that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17295-1
02:20:15.609 --> 02:20:17.857
<v Josh Sparkes>As long as we've got a note on it, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17300-0
02:20:18.817 --> 02:20:21.777
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you, Mark, for that. Yeah, thanks,
Mark.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17338-0
02:20:26.137 --> 02:20:32.497
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. And data inputs for said requests.
Debbie made some suggestions here.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17338-1
02:20:32.497 --> 02:20:38.599
<v Josh Sparkes>So when you're creating them,
you would have this sort of structure of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17338-2
02:20:38.599 --> 02:20:42.897
<v Josh Sparkes>legal,
you'd have literally all the skills level.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17377-0
02:20:43.417 --> 02:20:48.667
<v Josh Sparkes>Presumably an associated rate.
I mean you get the sort of, as you said,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17377-1
02:20:48.667 --> 02:20:52.751
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a default currency probably at
their locations,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17377-2
02:20:52.751 --> 02:20:58.147
<v Josh Sparkes>but does everything also convert you have
an exchange rate for reporting?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17377-3
02:20:58.147 --> 02:20:59.897
<v Josh Sparkes>It's all in sterling or?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17425-0
02:21:00.177 --> 02:21:04.394
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there a is that not it can just be
whatever's currency's entered and you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17425-1
02:21:04.394 --> 02:21:08.833
<v Josh Sparkes>have that conversion rate every month.
That's the conversion rate's fixed every</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17425-2
02:21:08.833 --> 02:21:12.994
<v Josh Sparkes>month. Yeah, when we're doing our rates,
it's normally I'm going two ways.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17425-3
02:21:12.994 --> 02:21:16.657
<v Josh Sparkes>It depends on the high and it will either
be by matter level, so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17459-0
02:21:17.217 --> 02:21:21.599
<v Josh Sparkes>Whatever the matter currency is going to
be, we're in euro,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17459-1
02:21:21.599 --> 02:21:26.638
<v Josh Sparkes>it will be their euro rate.
There's another way where it will be the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17459-2
02:21:26.638 --> 02:21:31.897
<v Josh Sparkes>timekeeper's own currency converted into
whatever currency. Yeah, it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17462-0
02:21:32.657 --> 02:21:34.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Can we go fast? Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17496-0
02:21:35.977 --> 02:21:39.965
<v Josh Sparkes>So Councillor, so if you've got,
you've got and they're not named,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17496-1
02:21:39.965 --> 02:21:42.941
<v Josh Sparkes>are they?
So you have or are they named along it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17496-2
02:21:42.941 --> 02:21:45.798
<v Josh Sparkes>So you just have lawyer,
certain rate per hour,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17496-3
02:21:45.798 --> 02:21:48.477
<v Josh Sparkes>but not names within those timekeeper
rates.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17496-4
02:21:48.477 --> 02:21:50.977
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just their high fall that's captured.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17521-0
02:21:52.257 --> 02:21:57.806
<v Josh Sparkes>We're talking for a rate uploads. Yes,
it would be their fund people ID,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17521-1
02:21:57.806 --> 02:22:01.759
<v Josh Sparkes>their fund people name, OK, their rank,
their rate,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17521-2
02:22:01.759 --> 02:22:06.017
<v Josh Sparkes>the date that they deal is fine.
So the effective date.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17528-0
02:22:10.057 --> 02:22:12.377
<v Josh Sparkes>And they're standing right as well as
something.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17545-0
02:22:13.777 --> 02:22:20.017
<v Josh Sparkes>They're right on standard right. Yes,
and they're right. They're right on this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17547-0
02:22:20.577 --> 02:22:24.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Lots of notes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17590-0
02:22:26.537 --> 02:22:32.014
<v Josh Sparkes>Not to add complexity that that would all
be in one currency. I mean, you don't get,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17590-1
02:22:32.014 --> 02:22:36.331
<v Josh Sparkes>but then you'll be time keeper,
vacation time, vacation, currency.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17590-2
02:22:36.331 --> 02:22:41.228
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah, I don't have a screenshot,
maybe I can just have a picture of that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17590-3
02:22:41.228 --> 02:22:44.257
<v Josh Sparkes>and then um, but that makes sense as well.
Um.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17619-0
02:22:44.697 --> 02:22:50.119
<v Josh Sparkes>And I know that we thought that we're
aiming to get towards this globalised</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17619-1
02:22:50.119 --> 02:22:54.257
<v Josh Sparkes>form and I'm not sure,
I mean is that is that applicable?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17619-2
02:22:54.257 --> 02:22:59.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you have any variations across
Australia or the UK where that differs?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17650-0
02:23:01.657 --> 02:23:06.893
<v Josh Sparkes>There wouldn't be if as in process.
It is different depending on high end and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17650-1
02:23:06.893 --> 02:23:11.458
<v Josh Sparkes>and then on where the matter is in
location, but how we process it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17650-2
02:23:11.458 --> 02:23:16.291
<v Josh Sparkes>how we upgrade it, submit the rate,
it's exactly the same location. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17650-3
02:23:16.291 --> 02:23:17.097
<v Josh Sparkes>that's good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17652-0
02:23:21.297 --> 02:23:21.937
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17667-0
02:23:24.297 --> 02:23:30.897
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, it's got the effective start date,
end dates.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17673-0
02:23:33.417 --> 02:23:36.577
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I've got.
I've got those fields written.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17706-0
02:23:37.657 --> 02:23:42.718
<v Josh Sparkes>Ian Lanswick is yourself who's got that
skill metrics that may be picking up</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17706-1
02:23:42.718 --> 02:23:46.596
<v Josh Sparkes>associated with.
I don't think he's brought skills metrics</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17706-2
02:23:46.596 --> 02:23:49.948
<v Josh Sparkes>with you that you can share that we can,
you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17706-3
02:23:49.948 --> 02:23:52.577
<v Josh Sparkes>makes that auto assignment a lot easier.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17750-0
02:23:53.657 --> 02:23:58.318
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe so to a certain value,
it goes to a certain group and I think</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17750-1
02:23:58.318 --> 02:24:03.460
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll get on to that in a minute,
but if if it needs approval based on the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17750-2
02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:07.915
<v Josh Sparkes>information added we can,
but certainly within your group as you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17750-3
02:24:07.915 --> 02:24:13.057
<v Josh Sparkes>say there's 11 of you who that gets
associated with based on the patriots.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17795-0
02:24:13.337 --> 02:24:17.108
<v Josh Sparkes>It's most of the time at the moment.
It's like who's done this, right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17795-1
02:24:17.108 --> 02:24:20.454
<v Josh Sparkes>Who's working on this?
So it's trying to figure out and assign</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17795-2
02:24:20.454 --> 02:24:24.173
<v Josh Sparkes>it where it just goes to the skills
metrics. Yeah, yeah, that's good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17795-3
02:24:24.173 --> 02:24:28.475
<v Josh Sparkes>As it's first landing point, of course,
that's not said it's only can reassigned</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17795-4
02:24:28.475 --> 02:24:29.697
<v Josh Sparkes>or I'm working on this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17813-0
02:24:30.217 --> 02:24:33.528
<v Josh Sparkes>A particular one.
I've worked on this before. As you said,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17813-1
02:24:33.528 --> 02:24:37.962
<v Josh Sparkes>it's separated by clients. You know,
person always works on Bank of America or</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17813-2
02:24:37.962 --> 02:24:41.217
<v Josh Sparkes>whatever it might be,
but I could be also a scientist on.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17825-0
02:24:43.337 --> 02:24:51.577
<v Josh Sparkes>We need the same logic regarding the
split low locale wise, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17833-0
02:25:02.377 --> 02:25:04.737
<v Josh Sparkes>Next Yeah, it's just.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17841-0
02:25:06.177 --> 02:25:10.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, definitely, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17858-0
02:25:14.617 --> 02:25:18.717
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
we've got one forward capacity to have</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17858-1
02:25:18.717 --> 02:25:24.457
<v Josh Sparkes>specific data within them and different
routing based on that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17863-0
02:25:28.137 --> 02:25:31.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, one form. Um.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17908-0
02:25:32.057 --> 02:25:35.601
<v Josh Sparkes>What rates and date range,
I think we've covered that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17908-1
02:25:35.601 --> 02:25:40.369
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the productivity of that,
whether again the bit we discussed with</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17908-2
02:25:40.369 --> 02:25:44.364
<v Josh Sparkes>the client on boarding,
whether you want a placeholder that's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17908-3
02:25:44.364 --> 02:25:47.457
<v Josh Sparkes>waiting information,
what information you need.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17944-0
02:25:47.897 --> 02:25:53.033
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there any supporting evidence that you
need to capture as part of that, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17944-1
02:25:53.033 --> 02:25:56.114
<v Josh Sparkes>agreed with the client, agreed with the,
you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17944-2
02:25:56.114 --> 02:25:59.921
<v Josh Sparkes>there might be some additional things
that you inferred today,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17944-3
02:25:59.921 --> 02:26:02.217
<v Josh Sparkes>but we should capture on the the form.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17991-0
02:26:05.017 --> 02:26:10.599
<v Josh Sparkes>So, for instance,
I get the form and have the rights.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17991-1
02:26:10.599 --> 02:26:18.662
<v Josh Sparkes>I can't. I'll just keep it open. Pending.
OK, waiting and waiting and answer.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/17991-2
02:26:18.662 --> 02:26:22.177
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can wait and approve. Wait.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18023-0
02:26:22.377 --> 02:26:27.032
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good. And then who formed,
you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18023-1
02:26:27.032 --> 02:26:35.178
<v Josh Sparkes>a supporting evidence you say who's a
couple and that approval has come from</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18023-2
02:26:35.178 --> 02:26:40.257
<v Josh Sparkes>and it could be a a named person. Yeah,
OK, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18056-0
02:26:40.577 --> 02:26:44.805
<v Josh Sparkes>It'll just be a notification that comes
in. So really,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18056-1
02:26:44.805 --> 02:26:50.723
<v Josh Sparkes>you want that notification to be able to
come in and identify what case it's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18056-2
02:26:50.723 --> 02:26:55.413
<v Josh Sparkes>assigned to, just like that change here.
Yeah, it can. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18056-3
02:26:55.413 --> 02:26:58.257
<v Josh Sparkes>these will have a case number anyway.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18110-0
02:26:58.737 --> 02:27:01.766
<v Josh Sparkes>And we sequentials that created.
So it could be referring.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18110-1
02:27:01.766 --> 02:27:05.925
<v Josh Sparkes>I suppose what would be really helpful is
if the system can be smart and because</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18110-2
02:27:05.925 --> 02:27:10.033
<v Josh Sparkes>the the notification will come through
the portal without any of the ServiceNow</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18110-3
02:27:10.033 --> 02:27:12.857
<v Josh Sparkes>stuff on it.
So it's understanding that it can then go</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18110-4
02:27:12.857 --> 02:27:16.297
<v Josh Sparkes>into the existing case that's already
there because at the moment.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18160-0
02:27:16.537 --> 02:27:21.050
<v Josh Sparkes>It'll come in as a case and it'll cut a
new case and share well and then the team</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18160-1
02:27:21.050 --> 02:27:23.636
<v Josh Sparkes>will need to apply that and tie them
together.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18160-2
02:27:23.636 --> 02:27:26.884
<v Josh Sparkes>So if we can do some thinking around how
we could do that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18160-3
02:27:26.884 --> 02:27:31.452
<v Josh Sparkes>if it's particular language that comes in
the e-mail and it's a tied to the client</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18160-4
02:27:31.452 --> 02:27:31.617
<v Josh Sparkes>or.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18164-0
02:27:31.737 --> 02:27:34.657
<v Josh Sparkes>The portal or whatever,
whatever that identification piece is.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18168-0
02:27:36.497 --> 02:27:38.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Into it, yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18212-0
02:27:41.057 --> 02:27:45.031
<v Josh Sparkes>I recognise I may be asking for more. No,
no, I was just thinking.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18212-1
02:27:45.031 --> 02:27:49.540
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just going to say in in in the past,
when you're sending information,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18212-2
02:27:49.540 --> 02:27:53.573
<v Josh Sparkes>it has a string attached to it.
You know when you're communicating,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18212-3
02:27:53.573 --> 02:27:56.777
<v Josh Sparkes>you know your handshakes and when it
handshakes back.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18248-0
02:27:57.417 --> 02:28:02.108
<v Josh Sparkes>They can be those references and mark or
or say similar things,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18248-1
02:28:02.108 --> 02:28:05.846
<v Josh Sparkes>but they can be that even though it's not
visible.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18229-0
02:28:03.177 --> 02:28:05.217
<v Mark Sedgey>Yep, agreed.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18248-2
02:28:05.846 --> 02:28:11.417
<v Josh Sparkes>You've definitely got that ID that says
and when it comes back it it links.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18280-0
02:28:12.457 --> 02:28:14.989
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah,
but one of the things you might choose to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18280-1
02:28:14.989 --> 02:28:17.733
<v Mark Sedgey>do is openly show that so that there's a
reference.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18280-2
02:28:17.733 --> 02:28:21.109
<v Mark Sedgey>So if anyone's talking about it,
any record they're looking at,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18280-3
02:28:21.109 --> 02:28:24.697
<v Mark Sedgey>they can easily see what it refers to,
what it what it's linked to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18278-0
02:28:24.937 --> 02:28:25.137
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18282-0
02:28:31.137 --> 02:28:31.457
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18307-0
02:28:35.537 --> 02:28:39.176
<v Josh Sparkes>Kind of talk through this one as we've
gone,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18307-1
02:28:39.176 --> 02:28:42.978
<v Josh Sparkes>we've got it new or new reports or the
client,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18307-2
02:28:42.978 --> 02:28:49.287
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got the client rejection and I can
see there's quite a again that high</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18307-3
02:28:49.287 --> 02:28:50.177
<v Josh Sparkes>percentage.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18342-0
02:28:50.537 --> 02:28:56.574
<v Josh Sparkes>Of that and then we talk a little bit
about is that can I just ask whether that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18342-1
02:28:56.574 --> 02:29:02.535
<v Josh Sparkes>rejection rate is because they've been
added in their rejectives and if we run</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18342-2
02:29:02.535 --> 02:29:08.497
<v Josh Sparkes>that report that you do regularly that
would capture some of those rejections.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18351-0
02:29:08.857 --> 02:29:12.476
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
as they they could have been naturally</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18351-1
02:29:12.476 --> 02:29:16.257
<v Josh Sparkes>amended depending on when that report was
run.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18358-0
02:29:19.697 --> 02:29:24.057
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, later on having to put that together.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18393-0
02:29:29.897 --> 02:29:36.613
<v Josh Sparkes>This is the global view, no approval.
So I think I touched on this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18393-1
02:29:36.613 --> 02:29:44.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there anything that's flagged that
suddenly a rate is beyond the threshold?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18407-0
02:29:45.097 --> 02:29:50.305
<v Josh Sparkes>That needs approving or a bit like
onboarding that slide if it's already</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18407-1
02:29:50.305 --> 02:29:53.017
<v Josh Sparkes>been redetermined. So no, no approval.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18418-0
02:29:56.377 --> 02:30:02.377
<v Josh Sparkes>If you submit a rate, it's too high,
the client. Anyway, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18430-0
02:30:03.337 --> 02:30:06.997
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
Are there any other teams or functions</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18430-1
02:30:06.997 --> 02:30:09.977
<v Josh Sparkes>involved in any of these processes?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18473-0
02:30:11.977 --> 02:30:15.519
<v Josh Sparkes>I know we're obviously updating the rates
and stuff in the portals,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18473-1
02:30:15.519 --> 02:30:18.853
<v Josh Sparkes>that's what you're doing.
But do you need to sense check any of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18473-2
02:30:18.853 --> 02:30:22.447
<v Josh Sparkes>those rates with other teams or anything
like that before you do it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18473-3
02:30:22.447 --> 02:30:25.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Or have you got all the information that
you pulled from a system?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18485-0
02:30:27.017 --> 02:30:32.530
<v Josh Sparkes>So if we just check it and we think it's
not much enough in the integrated</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18485-1
02:30:32.530 --> 02:30:35.177
<v Josh Sparkes>environment, but that would only be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18523-0
02:30:37.177 --> 02:30:43.269
<v Josh Sparkes>That's it's not matching up what we what
we know we've been so it's maybe not like</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18523-1
02:30:43.269 --> 02:30:48.260
<v Josh Sparkes>a standard workflow item,
but the ability to be what you say in the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18523-2
02:30:48.260 --> 02:30:52.297
<v Josh Sparkes>task ad block as and when to Rama who
will also be on.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18568-0
02:30:54.377 --> 02:30:58.804
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, service now, yeah.
Or I said waiting information referred to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18568-1
02:30:58.804 --> 02:31:02.762
<v Josh Sparkes>we can reassign, you know,
for them to look at it as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18568-2
02:31:02.762 --> 02:31:07.995
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be that they also check it as
part of that workflow within the if it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18568-3
02:31:07.995 --> 02:31:11.885
<v Josh Sparkes>needs it. Yeah,
I think it's probably more the e-mail and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18568-4
02:31:11.885 --> 02:31:13.697
<v Josh Sparkes>team should own that to us.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18587-0
02:31:13.897 --> 02:31:17.944
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you just asking a question?
So it's about that workflow task going</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18587-1
02:31:17.944 --> 02:31:20.452
<v Josh Sparkes>out to Rama,
then being able to provide the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18587-2
02:31:20.452 --> 02:31:23.417
<v Josh Sparkes>information and then pick up the rest of
the steps.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18589-0
02:31:25.497 --> 02:31:26.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Good one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18591-0
02:31:27.617 --> 02:31:28.017
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18600-0
02:31:33.457 --> 02:31:36.017
<v Josh Sparkes>SLAS.
Is there anything you guys are running?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18623-0
02:31:37.657 --> 02:31:42.291
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
three days that probably can be on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18623-1
02:31:42.291 --> 02:31:50.429
<v Josh Sparkes>approval to have them into the system.
It says three days from when the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18623-2
02:31:50.429 --> 02:31:52.577
<v Josh Sparkes>maintenance is run.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18629-0
02:31:52.937 --> 02:31:56.017
<v Josh Sparkes>To have the facilities in three days in
generators.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18662-0
02:32:00.617 --> 02:32:07.860
<v Josh Sparkes>That should have been internally,
but presumably it also improves your</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18662-1
02:32:07.860 --> 02:32:15.817
<v Josh Sparkes>rejection rate of having them approved to
get them up to get them back again.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18663-0
02:32:19.577 --> 02:32:19.857
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18683-0
02:32:21.257 --> 02:32:25.792
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we talked about notifications
because you're doing it internally rather</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18683-1
02:32:25.792 --> 02:32:30.497
<v Josh Sparkes>than requester that you'll be using your
dashboards just as long as that activity.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18685-0
02:32:30.537 --> 02:32:31.457
<v Josh Sparkes>To see.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18704-0
02:32:32.537 --> 02:32:38.072
<v Josh Sparkes>Then we discussed, you know,
maybe there was some enrollment or</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18704-1
02:32:38.072 --> 02:32:44.558
<v Josh Sparkes>previous that need to come in to send
those notifications which would also</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18704-2
02:32:44.558 --> 02:32:45.337
<v Josh Sparkes>captions.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18715-0
02:32:50.377 --> 02:32:52.683
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, with that,
anything we haven't touched on,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18715-1
02:32:52.683 --> 02:32:54.057
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's quite thorough.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18756-0
02:32:54.697 --> 02:33:00.514
<v Josh Sparkes>No, I think we've got the trigger points.
I'm pleased that we've actually hit this</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18756-1
02:33:00.514 --> 02:33:05.280
<v Josh Sparkes>part of the sub time on boarding that it
naturally flows from that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18756-2
02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:09.064
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got the data fields. No,
I think that's a good,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18756-3
02:33:09.064 --> 02:33:11.097
<v Josh Sparkes>good recommendation of those.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18794-0
02:33:11.417 --> 02:33:15.448
<v Josh Sparkes>One form new and the amendment of and you
know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18794-1
02:33:15.448 --> 02:33:21.411
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe the amendment of is that it is
pulling in the previously agreed,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18794-2
02:33:21.411 --> 02:33:25.778
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
you know it's already capturing the value</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18794-3
02:33:25.778 --> 02:33:29.977
<v Josh Sparkes>of what you're amending on rather than
having to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18815-0
02:33:30.697 --> 02:33:35.105
<v Josh Sparkes>Enter. You know everything from scratch.
They're not blank.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18815-1
02:33:35.105 --> 02:33:41.057
<v Josh Sparkes>So you get that transparency of what was
before for you to reconcile afterwards.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18846-0
02:33:42.377 --> 02:33:47.290
<v Josh Sparkes>They could pull that record of it was,
say for example you created it previously,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18846-1
02:33:47.290 --> 02:33:51.784
<v Josh Sparkes>it would have that details of that of
which you're amending on and you can</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18846-2
02:33:51.784 --> 02:33:55.978
<v Josh Sparkes>either add a new person or you're
amending the rate at the same time.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18846-3
02:33:55.978 --> 02:33:57.297
<v Josh Sparkes>Would that be helpful?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18851-0
02:34:05.337 --> 02:34:08.177
<v Josh Sparkes>You can tell that I know from what we're
seeing.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18864-0
02:34:12.697 --> 02:34:21.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Those you prefer is that each one is
mutually exclusive. Yeah, I think.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18877-0
02:34:25.897 --> 02:34:31.619
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I think each one, each one,
each one in new tasks. Yeah, that's OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18877-1
02:34:31.619 --> 02:34:32.857
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's fine.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18928-0
02:34:34.337 --> 02:34:37.133
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
it's something you're including later as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18928-1
02:34:37.133 --> 02:34:41.356
<v Josh Sparkes>a reconciled activity based on the
previous one. But as you're saying,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18928-2
02:34:41.356 --> 02:34:44.568
<v Josh Sparkes>I think I've also heard that once upload
and approve,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18928-3
02:34:44.568 --> 02:34:48.911
<v Josh Sparkes>then you you're not reconciling anyway.
OK, OK, that's good. Got it. No,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18928-4
02:34:48.911 --> 02:34:50.577
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you're good on that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18952-0
02:34:50.897 --> 02:34:53.540
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
So generally sound OK when we talk</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18952-1
02:34:53.540 --> 02:34:57.131
<v Josh Sparkes>through that and how it's approaching it.
OK, great.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18952-2
02:34:57.131 --> 02:35:02.417
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm sorry that then nine processes have
gone into recommendation of one form.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18985-0
02:35:04.217 --> 02:35:08.153
<v Josh Sparkes>I'd probably just ask again from a pain
point perspective,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18985-1
02:35:08.153 --> 02:35:11.957
<v Josh Sparkes>either internally or customers or
updating your portals,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18985-2
02:35:11.957 --> 02:35:14.959
<v Josh Sparkes>etcetera or your rejections like Debra
said.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18985-3
02:35:14.959 --> 02:35:19.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there anything else that sits across
that that's a pain at the moment?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/18987-0
02:35:21.057 --> 02:35:22.697
<v Josh Sparkes>that we haven't talked about.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19009-0
02:35:24.697 --> 02:35:27.820
<v Josh Sparkes>Over the question,
I think you mentioned the questions that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19009-1
02:35:27.820 --> 02:35:31.516
<v Josh Sparkes>you get asked, you know, are they done?
That sounds like a pain point,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19009-2
02:35:31.516 --> 02:35:32.297
<v Josh Sparkes>but low volume.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19013-0
02:35:33.017 --> 02:35:34.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I extendly that's it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19053-0
02:35:35.897 --> 02:35:42.228
<v Josh Sparkes>Bill, thank you. That's good. All right.
I'm just going to take a bit of a step</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19053-1
02:35:42.228 --> 02:35:46.739
<v Josh Sparkes>back actually.
I'm more speaking to Lauren and Megan and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19053-2
02:35:46.739 --> 02:35:51.725
<v Josh Sparkes>at the end of the day,
ServiceNow is here to help facilitate a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19053-3
02:35:51.725 --> 02:35:54.337
<v Josh Sparkes>better end to end process for us.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19089-0
02:35:55.377 --> 02:36:02.627
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you kind of take your blinkers off
of share wall and a ticketing system and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19089-1
02:36:02.627 --> 02:36:09.878
<v Josh Sparkes>think about how could we get ServiceNow
to help us do our job kind of you know is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19089-2
02:36:09.878 --> 02:36:12.177
<v Josh Sparkes>that anything in terms of.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19134-0
02:36:12.457 --> 02:36:18.146
<v Josh Sparkes>Where you get info, how you get info,
what you don't get that we can throw onto</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19134-1
02:36:18.146 --> 02:36:23.052
<v Josh Sparkes>the table and these guys will be able to
see now you're barking mad.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19134-2
02:36:23.052 --> 02:36:27.817
<v Josh Sparkes>We're never going to be able to do that.
But alternatively, right,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19134-3
02:36:27.817 --> 02:36:31.657
<v Josh Sparkes>because I'm just conscious that we're
thinking about.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19168-0
02:36:32.537 --> 02:36:38.334
<v Josh Sparkes>The pain points we have with the existing
systems and processes and trying to fix</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19168-1
02:36:38.334 --> 02:36:43.989
<v Josh Sparkes>them when actually what we're trying to
do is get a better end to end solution,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19168-2
02:36:43.989 --> 02:36:46.817
<v Josh Sparkes>so looking at it from a different angle.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19234-0
02:36:48.377 --> 02:36:51.609
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
we can do this after client awarding that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19234-1
02:36:51.609 --> 02:36:55.028
<v Josh Sparkes>can come in.
We've got the rates and matter. You know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19234-2
02:36:55.028 --> 02:36:59.069
<v Josh Sparkes>there is that source over here that we
can pull on, as you said,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19234-3
02:36:59.069 --> 02:37:03.732
<v Josh Sparkes>it's to make it better. You know,
it's not in its own ecosystem e-billing.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19234-4
02:37:03.732 --> 02:37:07.897
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got lots around you to pull upon
which will make your life.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19285-0
02:37:07.977 --> 02:37:11.165
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
because actually evening and you already</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19285-1
02:37:11.165 --> 02:37:14.228
<v Josh Sparkes>know this,
you're you're the most out of all the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19285-2
02:37:14.228 --> 02:37:17.665
<v Josh Sparkes>work streams.
You have the highest volume of activity.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19285-3
02:37:17.665 --> 02:37:21.041
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's like 7000 a month compared
to, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19285-4
02:37:21.041 --> 02:37:26.104
<v Josh Sparkes>not I'm saying the others are just low
volume, high, high into and close senses.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19285-5
02:37:26.104 --> 02:37:27.417
<v Josh Sparkes>So you have a lot of.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19314-0
02:37:27.657 --> 02:37:33.156
<v Josh Sparkes>Activity over 11 of you over the month.
That's a large queue. So yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19314-1
02:37:33.156 --> 02:37:37.803
<v Josh Sparkes>as Lynn was saying,
there's a ecosystem that you fit within</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19314-2
02:37:37.803 --> 02:37:43.457
<v Josh Sparkes>to pull upon and you have touched upon
them around the, you know, rates.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19367-0
02:37:43.817 --> 02:37:48.228
<v Josh Sparkes>Awarding the portals, etcetera.
But anything you can want to extract and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19367-1
02:37:48.228 --> 02:37:53.243
<v Josh Sparkes>you have it all at your fingertips anyway,
but service now can be those connectors</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19367-2
02:37:53.243 --> 02:37:56.386
<v Josh Sparkes>for that.
I think that's the other thing just to be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19367-3
02:37:56.386 --> 02:37:59.770
<v Josh Sparkes>conscious of,
which why I was asking about Rama earlier</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19367-4
02:37:59.770 --> 02:38:03.577
<v Josh Sparkes>as we go through this week,
we're obviously going to speak to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19426-0
02:38:03.577 --> 02:38:07.635
<v Josh Sparkes>All the finance teams will be asking the
same questions and your own processes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19426-1
02:38:07.635 --> 02:38:11.186
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you touch on other teams?
Because actually once we've gone through</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19426-2
02:38:11.186 --> 02:38:13.976
<v Josh Sparkes>all the teams,
we don't have that documented just now,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19426-3
02:38:13.976 --> 02:38:18.186
<v Josh Sparkes>but we should be able to have sight based
on what you guys are pulling out of what</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19426-4
02:38:18.186 --> 02:38:21.027
<v Josh Sparkes>that looks like,
which then leads into the intent piece</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19426-5
02:38:21.027 --> 02:38:21.737
<v Josh Sparkes>that actually.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19486-0
02:38:22.137 --> 02:38:25.732
<v Josh Sparkes>We can step out a little bit more and see
if we could join all these up,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19486-1
02:38:25.732 --> 02:38:29.721
<v Josh Sparkes>we could move a little bit of this around
and it makes it a lot easier from that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19486-2
02:38:29.721 --> 02:38:32.233
<v Josh Sparkes>end to end perspective.
So just keep that in mind.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19486-3
02:38:32.233 --> 02:38:34.941
<v Josh Sparkes>If you're speaking to key teams through
the processes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19486-4
02:38:34.941 --> 02:38:38.881
<v Josh Sparkes>just call them out so we can capture it
and we can start to draw that what that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19486-5
02:38:38.881 --> 02:38:39.817
<v Josh Sparkes>picture looks like.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19535-0
02:38:40.697 --> 02:38:44.648
<v Josh Sparkes>I think actually the next one,
I mean probably client onboarding,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19535-1
02:38:44.648 --> 02:38:49.139
<v Josh Sparkes>I think one of the other work streams
that we will carry this forward into</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19535-2
02:38:49.139 --> 02:38:53.869
<v Josh Sparkes>their time keeper rates as particular to
yourself invoicing which will come to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19535-3
02:38:53.869 --> 02:38:58.240
<v Josh Sparkes>next. I think that connecting,
connecting that's all we'll get into that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19535-4
02:38:58.240 --> 02:38:59.737
<v Josh Sparkes>connecting conversations.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19548-0
02:39:00.137 --> 02:39:02.769
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it was across the whole work
stream,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19548-1
02:39:02.769 --> 02:39:06.102
<v Josh Sparkes>so I'm going to take your conversations
in, as you said,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19548-2
02:39:06.102 --> 02:39:07.857
<v Josh Sparkes>build them into a process for.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19549-0
02:39:09.617 --> 02:39:09.697
<v Josh Sparkes>Um.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19567-0
02:39:11.577 --> 02:39:20.097
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we and the client on boarding
triggering process that can aid with this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19578-0
02:39:21.617 --> 02:39:28.480
<v Josh Sparkes>And the communications between the
rejection of the importance. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19578-1
02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:29.657
<v Josh Sparkes>that's good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19605-0
02:39:30.937 --> 02:39:38.961
<v Josh Sparkes>We we do have invoicing to go into next,
but it is quite a hefty piece as you are</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19605-1
02:39:38.961 --> 02:39:44.343
<v Josh Sparkes>aware. Yeah,
or do we want to do manage accruals first</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19605-2
02:39:44.343 --> 02:39:48.257
<v Josh Sparkes>and then then have a coffee for invoice?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19606-0
02:39:49.057 --> 02:39:49.177
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19626-0
02:39:50.137 --> 02:39:57.948
<v Josh Sparkes>You can lunch however you want. Yeah,
but actually even then I put manage</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19626-1
02:39:57.948 --> 02:40:05.337
<v Josh Sparkes>invoices one because it has multiple
scenarios within it, but that's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19662-0
02:40:05.337 --> 02:40:10.460
<v Josh Sparkes>They must say that's funny.
Manage accruals, as you say, easy.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19662-1
02:40:10.460 --> 02:40:15.096
<v Josh Sparkes>There's three processes associated with
that. And again,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19662-2
02:40:15.096 --> 02:40:21.114
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got media and client accruals.
They were very much saying the new,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19662-3
02:40:21.114 --> 02:40:22.497
<v Josh Sparkes>probably new and.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19665-0
02:40:22.617 --> 02:40:25.817
<v Josh Sparkes>Administration of it. Is that fair to say?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19708-0
02:40:26.777 --> 02:40:32.800
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, that we knew a cause coming in.
It's generally triggered from the client</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19708-1
02:40:32.800 --> 02:40:36.583
<v Josh Sparkes>portals.
You know to say our call call window is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19708-2
02:40:36.583 --> 02:40:42.915
<v Josh Sparkes>opened and you submit these by X deadline
OK and then we the information and then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19708-3
02:40:42.915 --> 02:40:44.537
<v Josh Sparkes>that into the portal.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19752-0
02:40:46.217 --> 02:40:49.052
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a few ways that we gather that
information.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19752-1
02:40:49.052 --> 02:40:52.214
<v Josh Sparkes>So we put it directly from 3E or there's
certain clients,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19752-2
02:40:52.214 --> 02:40:54.722
<v Josh Sparkes>certain partners that we they want to
submit,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19752-3
02:40:54.722 --> 02:40:58.320
<v Josh Sparkes>they want to give us the bigger to submit
and what's the percent?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19752-4
02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:02.137
<v Josh Sparkes>How many of those out of your 59?
Is that low volume or most of them?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19791-0
02:41:04.417 --> 02:41:08.711
<v Josh Sparkes>Out of Alice, we have four hundreds,
430 evening clients.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19791-1
02:41:08.711 --> 02:41:13.893
<v Josh Sparkes>I probably say 60 rest of the world.
We have two recruits each month.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19791-2
02:41:13.893 --> 02:41:18.557
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes they're monthly,
sometimes they're quarterly, right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19791-3
02:41:18.557 --> 02:41:21.297
<v Josh Sparkes>Most of them are monthly and I think.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19829-0
02:41:21.897 --> 02:41:26.848
<v Josh Sparkes>About 30 to 40 in Australia. OK,
but they're always triggered from the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19829-1
02:41:26.848 --> 02:41:30.823
<v Josh Sparkes>client and also they send this new
notifications, right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19829-2
02:41:30.823 --> 02:41:36.472
<v Josh Sparkes>And those and then three E's rather you
say is the other 3 E's where we pull the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19829-3
02:41:36.472 --> 02:41:37.937
<v Josh Sparkes>information. Oh yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19875-0
02:41:41.537 --> 02:41:45.165
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
So I've our recommendation again is that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19875-1
02:41:45.165 --> 02:41:49.519
<v Josh Sparkes>global view,
is that fair to say that you can have it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19875-2
02:41:49.519 --> 02:41:56.292
<v Josh Sparkes>as one management of that and so it's not
a schedule request that you do activities</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19875-3
02:41:56.292 --> 02:41:56.937
<v Josh Sparkes>or it's?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19902-0
02:41:57.537 --> 02:42:01.162
<v Josh Sparkes>Come from the e-portal a bit like we were
saying before,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19902-1
02:42:01.162 --> 02:42:05.804
<v Josh Sparkes>you know that handshake with that
notification can be incorporated where</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19902-2
02:42:05.804 --> 02:42:11.082
<v Josh Sparkes>you get that information schedule it and
we just OK the notification to last time,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19902-3
02:42:11.082 --> 02:42:11.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19941-0
02:42:18.697 --> 02:42:24.179
<v Josh Sparkes>Internal. Again, it's not requested by.
It's an internal activity similar to the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19941-1
02:42:24.179 --> 02:42:27.630
<v Josh Sparkes>timekeeper rates. It's not visible.
No exceptions.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19941-2
02:42:27.630 --> 02:42:33.113
<v Josh Sparkes>I know you had a one that was customer
relations. There's no exceptions to that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19941-3
02:42:33.113 --> 02:42:35.617
<v Josh Sparkes>but it needs to be visible from them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19943-0
02:42:35.657 --> 02:42:36.577
<v Josh Sparkes>But but these guys.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19957-0
02:42:41.897 --> 02:42:46.016
<v Josh Sparkes>But that's that comes in from a
notification of you. Oh,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19957-1
02:42:46.016 --> 02:42:48.257
<v Josh Sparkes>that's what it plan is. Oh, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19972-0
02:42:50.777 --> 02:42:54.436
<v Josh Sparkes>But the reporting team needs to be able
to raise it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19972-1
02:42:54.436 --> 02:42:56.577
<v Josh Sparkes>They've raised the discrepancy.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19996-0
02:42:57.897 --> 02:43:01.334
<v Josh Sparkes>No, no.
They only send me some clients that will</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19996-1
02:43:01.334 --> 02:43:07.225
<v Josh Sparkes>go to out since January and send it over
to us, but it will come from your request.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19996-2
02:43:07.225 --> 02:43:11.644
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got to send it.
So we have the back end, the E billing,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/19996-3
02:43:11.644 --> 02:43:12.977
<v Josh Sparkes>the E billing, Yep.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20043-0
02:43:16.177 --> 02:43:20.585
<v Josh Sparkes>Now I've got lots of different inputs in
here that you captures,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20043-1
02:43:20.585 --> 02:43:24.179
<v Josh Sparkes>so you can go through those.
So you'll have clients,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20043-2
02:43:24.179 --> 02:43:28.384
<v Josh Sparkes>you'll have different accrual amounts,
date, range, etcetera,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20043-3
02:43:28.384 --> 02:43:32.657
<v Josh Sparkes>assigned to these standard things that
we've got concerns now.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20049-0
02:43:33.017 --> 02:43:36.393
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll get to whether there's any
regulatory or compliant issues that you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20049-1
02:43:36.393 --> 02:43:37.097
<v Josh Sparkes>have with that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20084-0
02:43:41.017 --> 02:43:45.438
<v Josh Sparkes>Notes within the amount.
It would just be able to filter it when</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20084-1
02:43:45.438 --> 02:43:50.879
<v Josh Sparkes>we run them in 43 is some of the client
code in OK client and then it was which</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20084-2
02:43:50.879 --> 02:43:56.457
<v Josh Sparkes>is the cleaner and it will build all the
matters that have good balances on them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20130-0
02:43:56.697 --> 02:44:00.134
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll pull them out and then we match
that up to the auto.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20130-1
02:44:00.134 --> 02:44:04.388
<v Josh Sparkes>So on the client side they'll have their
e-mail in reference, then yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20130-2
02:44:04.388 --> 02:44:08.874
<v Josh Sparkes>reference and then we just match it up to
what we have. OK, that's good. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20130-3
02:44:08.874 --> 02:44:12.137
<v Josh Sparkes>so you've got some referencing client
code referencing.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20133-0
02:44:12.217 --> 02:44:14.377
<v Josh Sparkes>You can reference it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20143-0
02:44:15.337 --> 02:44:19.097
<v Josh Sparkes>What else you wanna name client code
reference even reference client code?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20144-0
02:44:21.457 --> 02:44:21.577
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20187-0
02:44:23.017 --> 02:44:26.124
<v Josh Sparkes>And again,
probably talking of blended anything as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20187-1
02:44:26.124 --> 02:44:29.291
<v Josh Sparkes>you said,
it's not reproducing the as is just right</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20187-2
02:44:29.291 --> 02:44:32.642
<v Josh Sparkes>once before.
Is there anything in there that you would</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20187-3
02:44:32.642 --> 02:44:37.333
<v Josh Sparkes>think actually this if you have this
piece of information that would be very</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20187-4
02:44:37.333 --> 02:44:40.257
<v Josh Sparkes>useful,
it would help us with our reporting or?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20197-0
02:44:40.737 --> 02:44:45.013
<v Josh Sparkes>Day-to-day management.
It would aid us to answer questions that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20197-1
02:44:45.013 --> 02:44:46.417
<v Josh Sparkes>we didn't have today.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20203-0
02:44:47.897 --> 02:44:49.137
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just the standards.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20242-0
02:44:50.697 --> 02:44:54.049
<v Josh Sparkes>Update the accrual and then the accrual.
Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20242-1
02:44:54.049 --> 02:44:59.614
<v Josh Sparkes>the information slide is the cleaner
number in the request is coming from the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20242-2
02:44:59.614 --> 02:45:04.536
<v Josh Sparkes>client and then we know that.
I don't think there's any way which on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20242-3
02:45:04.536 --> 02:45:09.601
<v Josh Sparkes>the back of it. So it's cleaner,
which is the client's ultimate client</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20242-4
02:45:09.601 --> 02:45:10.457
<v Josh Sparkes>number, yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20244-0
02:45:10.577 --> 02:45:10.657
<v Josh Sparkes>So.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20265-0
02:45:12.217 --> 02:45:17.357
<v Josh Sparkes>And if there's anything in the background
that you could then reference be like</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20265-1
02:45:17.357 --> 02:45:20.826
<v Josh Sparkes>Goldman Sachs,
that's the only number and it would be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20265-2
02:45:20.826 --> 02:45:22.497
<v Josh Sparkes>really helpful. Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20269-0
02:45:25.017 --> 02:45:27.297
<v Josh Sparkes>And it pops up all the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20284-0
02:45:28.737 --> 02:45:33.317
<v Josh Sparkes>Their balance or their whip balances or
their what information you want to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20284-1
02:45:33.317 --> 02:45:34.417
<v Josh Sparkes>extract from that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20333-0
02:45:36.697 --> 02:45:41.472
<v Josh Sparkes>You still need to run the report just to
have that to have that in the background</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20333-1
02:45:41.472 --> 02:45:45.548
<v Josh Sparkes>because it would just be OK a metrics of
my client name against that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20333-2
02:45:45.548 --> 02:45:49.683
<v Josh Sparkes>So than us we we saw this information
separately in an Excel document.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20333-3
02:45:49.683 --> 02:45:53.177
<v Josh Sparkes>So we put it from this and saves us
having to go from that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20374-0
02:45:53.697 --> 02:45:56.089
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
So if I was to take that back to client</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20374-1
02:45:56.089 --> 02:46:00.385
<v Josh Sparkes>on boarding, if you had that reference,
that particular reference against that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20374-2
02:46:00.385 --> 02:46:02.778
<v Josh Sparkes>record,
would that help you as a capture of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20374-3
02:46:02.778 --> 02:46:05.388
<v Josh Sparkes>fields?
So if you want to actually on client on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20374-4
02:46:05.388 --> 02:46:08.107
<v Josh Sparkes>boarding,
that's certainly as you said as a field</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20374-5
02:46:08.107 --> 02:46:10.337
<v Josh Sparkes>that can enrich your current process, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20401-0
02:46:10.857 --> 02:46:16.550
<v Josh Sparkes>Or in what systems the social truth
physical number. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20401-1
02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:24.641
<v Josh Sparkes>so is that something you would want to be
pulled out and identify that it's that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20401-2
02:46:24.641 --> 02:46:28.337
<v Josh Sparkes>particular client? Yeah, potentially.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20409-0
02:46:29.017 --> 02:46:34.697
<v Josh Sparkes>On that one, Yeah. Is that correct?
That's a complete guess. Is that right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20431-0
02:46:40.217 --> 02:46:48.687
<v Josh Sparkes>Unique number.
Is that the is it something you find</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20431-1
02:46:48.687 --> 02:46:56.017
<v Josh Sparkes>unique?
I think that can be a quiz for Rama.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20432-0
02:46:56.417 --> 02:46:56.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Um.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20447-0
02:47:02.857 --> 02:47:10.266
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe we could do a TQI quiz at the end
of this. Uh, all the acronyms that we use.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20447-1
02:47:10.266 --> 02:47:11.337
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20480-0
02:47:21.097 --> 02:47:27.956
<v Josh Sparkes>That's with yourself, internally, evenly,
and again from that skills mate,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20480-1
02:47:27.956 --> 02:47:34.541
<v Josh Sparkes>which you can assign accordingly.
I think with this to expect you don't</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20480-2
02:47:34.541 --> 02:47:40.577
<v Josh Sparkes>need two teams in Glasgow,
only one person just does our records.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20508-0
02:47:40.937 --> 02:47:46.997
<v Josh Sparkes>But in Brisbane, they do it per plan.
Again, this was matrix.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20508-1
02:47:46.997 --> 02:47:53.254
<v Josh Sparkes>So can you chat about that as a team?
One person just does. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20508-2
02:47:53.254 --> 02:47:58.337
<v Josh Sparkes>and then when they're awake,
it's auto assigned to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20548-0
02:47:58.577 --> 02:48:05.137
<v Josh Sparkes>Somebody else, somebody else. Oh, many.
OK, so so does that be going to continue?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20548-1
02:48:05.137 --> 02:48:09.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Or is that?
I think it goes that way just in terms of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20548-2
02:48:09.937 --> 02:48:14.737
<v Josh Sparkes>the quality of the head count.
So as you've written before,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20548-3
02:48:14.737 --> 02:48:16.737
<v Josh Sparkes>we've had a heavy one in.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20553-0
02:48:17.337 --> 02:48:21.027
<v Josh Sparkes>I was going to work,
spread out a lot more different skill</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20553-1
02:48:21.027 --> 02:48:23.217
<v Josh Sparkes>levels, things like that, a junior.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20566-0
02:48:25.897 --> 02:48:30.977
<v Josh Sparkes>I've seen just checked what the the team
members in laws, but.</v>

02:48:32.057 --> 02:48:34.257
<v Josh Sparkes>Those that are registered given this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20612-0
02:48:35.337 --> 02:48:40.543
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm not where it's it's slightly
processes Australia their partners like</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20612-1
02:48:40.543 --> 02:48:45.817
<v Josh Sparkes>to tell us what to put in the portal,
whereas in the rest of the log they're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20612-2
02:48:45.817 --> 02:48:51.297
<v Josh Sparkes>like go by three E what's sitting on the
block of variables partner preference.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20615-0
02:48:51.897 --> 02:48:54.737
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I was gonna say.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20617-0
02:48:55.897 --> 02:48:57.457
<v Josh Sparkes>That will be on I can do that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20653-0
02:48:59.417 --> 02:49:02.290
<v Josh Sparkes>I was going to say that was the
difference.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20653-1
02:49:02.290 --> 02:49:07.253
<v Josh Sparkes>The only difference in the process maps
really is that Australia goes has a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20653-2
02:49:07.253 --> 02:49:12.346
<v Josh Sparkes>request sent to the practice executive,
whereas the rest of the world says it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20653-3
02:49:12.346 --> 02:49:14.697
<v Josh Sparkes>goes through the reporting team, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20655-0
02:49:15.457 --> 02:49:15.577
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20666-0
02:49:18.137 --> 02:49:23.177
<v Josh Sparkes>And I would to your point,
is that moving forward?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20712-0
02:49:24.537 --> 02:49:29.943
<v Josh Sparkes>You get that assigning it to one person,
you get a single point of failure or you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20712-1
02:49:29.943 --> 02:49:33.174
<v Josh Sparkes>can do.
So it may be addressed and it becomes an</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20712-2
02:49:33.174 --> 02:49:38.383
<v Josh Sparkes>assignment group of which then can be
also assigned based on the client or the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20712-3
02:49:38.383 --> 02:49:42.009
<v Josh Sparkes>rest of the world,
but not always to always singularly</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20712-4
02:49:42.009 --> 02:49:42.537
<v Josh Sparkes>channel.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20732-0
02:49:43.017 --> 02:49:47.416
<v Josh Sparkes>For one person,
once we see that skills metrics,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20732-1
02:49:47.416 --> 02:49:51.097
<v Josh Sparkes>it will be something something we can do.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20785-0
02:49:49.297 --> 02:49:54.009
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, I'm glad. Sorry, sorry to interrupt.
I'm glad you raised that because I was</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20785-1
02:49:54.009 --> 02:49:58.779
<v Mark Sedgey>going to flag the same thing. You don't.
You kind of don't want it to go direct to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20785-2
02:49:58.779 --> 02:50:01.998
<v Mark Sedgey>an individual by workflow because if
they're not there,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20785-3
02:50:01.998 --> 02:50:05.273
<v Mark Sedgey>it's harder to recover that if for any
reason, as I say,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20785-4
02:50:05.273 --> 02:50:08.377
<v Mark Sedgey>they're poorly or whatever,
but their logic would be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20818-0
02:50:08.817 --> 02:50:13.891
<v Mark Sedgey>So you'd have an assignment group and
then you know that might be they might be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20818-1
02:50:13.891 --> 02:50:17.886
<v Mark Sedgey>the primary person who assigns that
ticket to them to work on,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20818-2
02:50:17.886 --> 02:50:22.897
<v Mark Sedgey>but it does give you cover if you know if
that individual isn't isn't present.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20831-0
02:50:25.297 --> 02:50:31.222
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Oh, yeah. We assign essentially.
We'll do that as standard anyway. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20831-1
02:50:31.222 --> 02:50:32.497
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, absolutely.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20847-0
02:50:34.137 --> 02:50:41.499
<v Josh Sparkes>We covered the country's strategics with
one form split by clients and school</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20847-1
02:50:41.499 --> 02:50:44.897
<v Josh Sparkes>lectures. So that's good. Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20868-0
02:50:52.217 --> 02:50:57.572
<v Josh Sparkes>Reference Cluner we got there. Yeah,
we covered the CLU number on that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20868-1
02:50:57.572 --> 02:51:02.550
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow. As you said,
you obtain it from your mechanisms portal.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20868-2
02:51:02.550 --> 02:51:05.417
<v Josh Sparkes>That's very good. That's that's clear.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20871-0
02:51:10.777 --> 02:51:12.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Got that there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20876-0
02:51:17.497 --> 02:51:21.257
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
no approval processes associated with it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20890-0
02:51:22.497 --> 02:51:27.293
<v Josh Sparkes>No,
I think you mentioned before like live</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20890-1
02:51:27.293 --> 02:51:30.417
<v Josh Sparkes>peer reviews, but no checks.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20942-0
02:51:34.057 --> 02:51:38.034
<v Josh Sparkes>No client specific again. OK. Yeah.
So what I don't know whether certain</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20942-1
02:51:38.034 --> 02:51:40.976
<v Josh Sparkes>clients have,
I mean in the past I've written certain</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20942-2
02:51:40.976 --> 02:51:45.280
<v Josh Sparkes>clients, even though they don't know this,
that they're ranked platinum, gold,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20942-3
02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:49.366
<v Josh Sparkes>silver, bronze, how we rank them,
of course they will believe that they're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20942-4
02:51:49.366 --> 02:51:49.857
<v Josh Sparkes>platinum.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20954-0
02:51:50.137 --> 02:51:54.049
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's the things that they get,
but if there's any associated things that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/20954-1
02:51:54.049 --> 02:51:56.377
<v Josh Sparkes>you have to turn around the different
clients.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21001-0
02:51:57.817 --> 02:52:01.025
<v Josh Sparkes>No,
the only deadline will be when the window</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21001-1
02:52:01.025 --> 02:52:03.955
<v Josh Sparkes>shuts.
So depending they'll they'll put a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21001-2
02:52:03.955 --> 02:52:07.861
<v Josh Sparkes>deadline in the they need to be split on
this deadline.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21001-3
02:52:07.861 --> 02:52:13.651
<v Josh Sparkes>This deadline otherwise we can't get into
it. How how long is the window open for?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21001-4
02:52:13.651 --> 02:52:17.697
<v Josh Sparkes>It depends. Sometimes it's two days,
sometimes it's week.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21022-0
02:52:19.297 --> 02:52:23.710
<v Josh Sparkes>Service now comes in that you get those,
you know, notifications, pre-population.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21022-1
02:52:23.710 --> 02:52:28.177
<v Josh Sparkes>It does the heavy lifting for you to turn
around to say for two days and you know.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21064-0
02:52:29.337 --> 02:52:33.881
<v Josh Sparkes>The same clients have the same window
open for the same length of time,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21064-1
02:52:33.881 --> 02:52:38.867
<v Josh Sparkes>or they could be depends on as well.
So they can send a request on a Saturday,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21064-2
02:52:38.867 --> 02:52:43.348
<v Josh Sparkes>probably not until the Monday.
So that shortens it down from five days</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21064-3
02:52:43.348 --> 02:52:44.737
<v Josh Sparkes>to yes, three days so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21101-0
02:52:44.777 --> 02:52:48.685
<v Josh Sparkes>So, OK, so again,
go in mind for the service now can do a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21101-1
02:52:48.685 --> 02:52:53.603
<v Josh Sparkes>lot of that also assignment pick,
you know anything where it reduces the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21101-2
02:52:53.603 --> 02:52:57.241
<v Josh Sparkes>SLAS for you.
I think we've captured a lot of that to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21101-3
02:52:57.241 --> 02:53:01.217
<v Josh Sparkes>do that for you.
I've been really good as well as I think.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21129-0
02:53:01.617 --> 02:53:05.780
<v Josh Sparkes>On the like the date that it's due
because we're looking at the body of the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21129-1
02:53:05.780 --> 02:53:08.574
<v Josh Sparkes>text, yes.
So you then have that metric going like</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21129-2
02:53:08.574 --> 02:53:11.532
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got.
We've had it before where we've missed it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21129-3
02:53:11.532 --> 02:53:14.929
<v Josh Sparkes>because we haven't.
It's not as easy to scope out and and the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21129-4
02:53:14.929 --> 02:53:16.737
<v Josh Sparkes>date you mean window closed, yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21150-0
02:53:19.337 --> 02:53:24.529
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll just throw a couple of things in
here and they might be out of place and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21150-1
02:53:24.529 --> 02:53:28.057
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll cover it either here or somebody
else. One is.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21169-0
02:53:29.017 --> 02:53:36.012
<v Josh Sparkes>The pacer or the priority that we give it
could well be the date the invoice was</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21169-1
02:53:36.012 --> 02:53:36.617
<v Josh Sparkes>raised.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21220-0
02:53:38.697 --> 02:53:43.287
<v Josh Sparkes>Which is different to the date that we
receive it. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21220-1
02:53:43.287 --> 02:53:48.627
<v Josh Sparkes>so an invoice can be raised,
but it doesn't find its way to the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21220-2
02:53:48.627 --> 02:53:54.135
<v Josh Sparkes>e-billing team for weeks,
sometimes longer for the 30 day payment</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21220-3
02:53:54.135 --> 02:53:55.137
<v Josh Sparkes>or whatever.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21261-0
02:53:58.217 --> 02:54:02.297
<v Josh Sparkes>Pressure.
But now what could have happened is that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21261-1
02:54:02.297 --> 02:54:07.097
<v Josh Sparkes>a partner is raising something to get it
off of their whip.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21261-2
02:54:07.097 --> 02:54:13.577
<v Josh Sparkes>So reduce their whip and the not that I'm
sure any partner ever does this and it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21261-3
02:54:13.577 --> 02:54:14.937
<v Josh Sparkes>sits in a drawer.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21311-0
02:54:15.457 --> 02:54:20.692
<v Josh Sparkes>Because they're not ready to send it to
the client because they may not have had</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21311-1
02:54:20.692 --> 02:54:24.570
<v Josh Sparkes>a discussion with the client about that
particular invoice.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21311-2
02:54:24.570 --> 02:54:27.673
<v Josh Sparkes>So then when we receive it, it's urgent,
right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21311-3
02:54:27.673 --> 02:54:32.650
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's urgent because it's 60 days old.
Well, actually we just received it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21311-4
02:54:32.650 --> 02:54:34.977
<v Josh Sparkes>so that can end up having an impact.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21342-0
02:54:35.257 --> 02:54:42.957
<v Josh Sparkes>On the priority that we may need to
assign because that is sitting in each</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21342-1
02:54:42.957 --> 02:54:50.657
<v Josh Sparkes>whip versus each debt and impacts are the
other one, the other point that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21399-0
02:54:51.017 --> 02:54:54.898
<v Josh Sparkes>Rightly or wrongly,
it can be who's the partner. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21399-1
02:54:54.898 --> 02:54:58.356
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's some partners that we will,
you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21399-2
02:54:58.356 --> 02:55:03.861
<v Josh Sparkes>if we do not deal with that problem,
it just goes all the way up the tree and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21399-3
02:55:03.861 --> 02:55:09.365
<v Josh Sparkes>all the way back down the tree and I'm
getting involved in it and then I draw</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21374-0
02:55:06.097 --> 02:55:06.337
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21399-4
02:55:09.365 --> 02:55:10.777
<v Josh Sparkes>Sandeep in and then.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21423-0
02:55:10.937 --> 02:55:15.166
<v Josh Sparkes>Sandy draws these guys in and all of a
sudden, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21403-0
02:55:15.137 --> 02:55:15.297
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21423-1
02:55:15.166 --> 02:55:20.657
<v Josh Sparkes>the management effort outweighs sometimes
the value of the invoice, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21411-0
02:55:16.497 --> 02:55:17.617
<v Mark Sedgey>So that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21476-0
02:55:19.897 --> 02:55:22.810
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.
So that that I think there's there's two</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21476-1
02:55:22.810 --> 02:55:27.458
<v Mark Sedgey>important sort of points on that one is
about tracking where you have that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21476-2
02:55:27.458 --> 02:55:30.371
<v Mark Sedgey>discrepancy,
where it's sat in that situation.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21476-3
02:55:30.371 --> 02:55:35.516
<v Mark Sedgey>So you can report on it and then actually
raise that up the stack so that you know</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21476-4
02:55:35.516 --> 02:55:39.297
<v Mark Sedgey>part of the organisational shift in terms
of the importance.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21530-0
02:55:39.417 --> 02:55:43.689
<v Mark Sedgey>Not leaving something sitting in a drawer,
not lagging on it or you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21530-1
02:55:43.689 --> 02:55:46.749
<v Mark Sedgey>whatever those, you know,
whatever those delays are.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21530-2
02:55:46.749 --> 02:55:49.290
<v Mark Sedgey>But to capture date of which it was
raised,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21530-3
02:55:49.290 --> 02:55:53.851
<v Mark Sedgey>dates of which you get it and some sort
of reasoning is an important bit of MI</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21530-4
02:55:53.851 --> 02:55:58.413
<v Mark Sedgey>that can actually help your organization
broadly because that level of failure</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21530-5
02:55:58.413 --> 02:55:58.817
<v Mark Sedgey>demand.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21565-0
02:55:59.017 --> 02:56:04.146
<v Mark Sedgey>Talk about your your escalations to your
point of who and what levels get involved</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21565-1
02:56:04.146 --> 02:56:07.917
<v Mark Sedgey>is actually significantly costly and
often goes goes hidden.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21565-2
02:56:07.917 --> 02:56:13.046
<v Mark Sedgey>So so we do need to think about a way of
capturing those so that you've got it and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21565-3
02:56:13.046 --> 02:56:15.457
<v Mark Sedgey>you can report on it out of ServiceNow.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21605-0
02:56:16.857 --> 02:56:19.167
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
And anything that we can do on that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21605-1
02:56:19.167 --> 02:56:22.524
<v Josh Sparkes>probably would be really helpful.
It's a hard one, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21605-2
02:56:22.524 --> 02:56:26.650
<v Josh Sparkes>when the firm is saying bill, bill, bill,
all right, like this is October,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21585-0
02:56:25.857 --> 02:56:26.177
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21605-3
02:56:26.650 --> 02:56:29.126
<v Josh Sparkes>it's our half year end and emails go
around,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21605-4
02:56:29.126 --> 02:56:31.657
<v Josh Sparkes>partners go and bill everything that you
can.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21639-0
02:56:33.097 --> 02:56:36.326
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
we don't mean bill everything we can,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21639-1
02:56:36.326 --> 02:56:40.510
<v Josh Sparkes>but then don't send the invoice.
We just bill to target,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21639-2
02:56:40.510 --> 02:56:46.014
<v Josh Sparkes>which means what we then see and maybe
when we get to the billing team and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21639-3
02:56:46.014 --> 02:56:49.097
<v Josh Sparkes>billing reversals, we see day one to five.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21687-0
02:56:49.577 --> 02:56:54.047
<v Josh Sparkes>A high volume of reversals,
but this team will never have seen the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21687-1
02:56:54.047 --> 02:56:57.916
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice. Yeah,
and that's part of the activity, isn't it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21653-0
02:56:55.897 --> 02:56:56.217
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21687-2
02:56:57.916 --> 02:57:01.252
<v Josh Sparkes>Is ServiceNow does that,
making that life easier.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21687-3
02:57:01.252 --> 02:57:04.988
<v Josh Sparkes>All those things that you said,
there is a voice. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21687-4
02:57:04.988 --> 02:57:07.057
<v Josh Sparkes>there is an opportunity for us.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21720-0
02:57:07.337 --> 02:57:13.129
<v Josh Sparkes>To think and we are considering it,
but it has to be done in a way where we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21720-1
02:57:13.129 --> 02:57:18.006
<v Josh Sparkes>can control and manage it,
where once a bill is raised within X</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21720-2
02:57:18.006 --> 02:57:22.350
<v Josh Sparkes>number of days,
it automatically gets issued. All right,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21720-3
02:57:22.350 --> 02:57:23.417
<v Josh Sparkes>so if that is.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21766-0
02:57:23.497 --> 02:57:28.277
<v Josh Sparkes>The kind of standard ways of working,
IE within seven days of a bill being</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21766-1
02:57:28.277 --> 02:57:31.081
<v Josh Sparkes>raised,
it's automatically issued and every</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21766-2
02:57:31.081 --> 02:57:36.179
<v Josh Sparkes>partner knows that and they only have
seven days to sort it and that might stop</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21766-3
02:57:36.179 --> 02:57:40.577
<v Josh Sparkes>some of the poor behaviours of raising
the invoice in the 1st place.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21830-0
02:57:40.777 --> 02:57:44.747
<v Josh Sparkes>There is an opportunity that we're not
ready to do that yet because some of the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21830-1
02:57:44.747 --> 02:57:47.030
<v Josh Sparkes>other challenges in lots of different
places,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21830-2
02:57:47.030 --> 02:57:50.206
<v Josh Sparkes>but it is something that we'll be
thinking about going forward.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21830-3
02:57:50.206 --> 02:57:52.787
<v Josh Sparkes>I was going to say like future model,
we might say,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21798-0
02:57:52.097 --> 02:57:52.337
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21830-4
02:57:52.787 --> 02:57:56.360
<v Josh Sparkes>well actually we can start to put in ways
to prevent the bad behaviour.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21830-5
02:57:56.360 --> 02:57:59.537
<v Josh Sparkes>So something might be actually sent to
business implementation.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21893-0
02:58:00.297 --> 02:58:04.050
<v Josh Sparkes>We have a date received which you will
get a response back in certain amount of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21893-1
02:58:04.050 --> 02:58:07.006
<v Josh Sparkes>days which then triggers the SLAS which
is also shown as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21893-2
02:58:07.006 --> 02:58:10.760
<v Josh Sparkes>So you're going to start setting global
standard that actually this is what you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21893-3
02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:12.824
<v Josh Sparkes>need to do.
If you want to get out quickly,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21893-4
02:58:12.824 --> 02:58:16.718
<v Josh Sparkes>you need to act really quickly as well on
your side and I think this is hard to do</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21867-0
02:58:14.377 --> 02:58:14.817
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21893-5
02:58:16.718 --> 02:58:20.097
<v Josh Sparkes>that though because it's a partner model
which is very hard to do that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21937-0
02:58:20.217 --> 02:58:26.442
<v Josh Sparkes>We're looking at E invoicing system and
statutory requirement across Europe for</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21937-1
02:58:26.442 --> 02:58:29.865
<v Josh Sparkes>all bills to be issued as an E bill,
right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21937-2
02:58:29.865 --> 02:58:35.235
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we are looking at that as part
of Sandeep's not here today,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21937-3
02:58:35.235 --> 02:58:40.137
<v Josh Sparkes>but in one of the other sessions we can
maybe give get him to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21991-0
02:58:40.137 --> 02:58:45.320
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a bit of an update on that which
we could use that system to, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21991-1
02:58:45.320 --> 02:58:50.438
<v Josh Sparkes>to automatically push out bills that we
probably can't at the moment. So yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21991-2
02:58:50.438 --> 02:58:54.390
<v Josh Sparkes>we can build these.
So I was going to say these services can</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21963-0
02:58:51.497 --> 02:58:52.937
<v Mark Sedgey>So one one of.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21991-3
02:58:54.390 --> 02:58:59.249
<v Josh Sparkes>be built to orchestrate as well.
So it could be just go straight to a team</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/21991-4
02:58:59.249 --> 02:58:59.897
<v Josh Sparkes>to manage.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22038-0
02:59:00.057 --> 02:59:02.115
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
support and drive the the creation of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22038-1
02:59:02.115 --> 02:59:04.173
<v Josh Sparkes>that invoice,
but you can also get it so it can</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22038-2
02:59:04.173 --> 02:59:06.317
<v Josh Sparkes>actually trigger certain points in other
systems.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22038-3
02:59:06.317 --> 02:59:09.533
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not saying we do that right now,
but that might be the next iteration.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22038-4
02:59:09.533 --> 02:59:11.677
<v Josh Sparkes>They start saying right,
we've got SLAS in place,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22038-5
02:59:11.677 --> 02:59:15.193
<v Josh Sparkes>that's the middle ground because now the
business knows how long we can expect to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22038-6
02:59:15.193 --> 02:59:16.137
<v Josh Sparkes>see that that process.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22089-0
02:59:16.217 --> 02:59:19.607
<v Josh Sparkes>And then it's OK, even further than that,
we're going to automate and push it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22089-1
02:59:19.607 --> 02:59:21.868
<v Josh Sparkes>through even quicker.
If you don't respond in time,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22089-2
02:59:21.868 --> 02:59:25.171
<v Josh Sparkes>it's automatically going through and
that's where reverses might say, well,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22089-3
02:59:25.171 --> 02:59:27.953
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a lot of things that we have to
reverse there. So yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22089-4
02:59:27.953 --> 02:59:30.083
<v Josh Sparkes>we do need to kind of talk through some
of that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22089-5
02:59:30.083 --> 02:59:33.257
<v Josh Sparkes>We we probably reverse about 30% of our
bills at the moment every month.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22085-0
02:59:32.177 --> 02:59:33.697
<v Mark Sedgey>Wow. Wow.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22150-0
02:59:33.257 --> 02:59:38.758
<v Josh Sparkes>Also value and volume globally. I mean,
I think it's like 18% of rejection.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22150-1
02:59:38.758 --> 02:59:42.304
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
there's lots of stuff that we thought,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22101-0
02:59:39.937 --> 02:59:41.777
<v Mark Sedgey>So they they they just.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22150-2
02:59:42.304 --> 02:59:45.779
<v Josh Sparkes>well,
if we can get that information upfront to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22150-3
02:59:45.779 --> 02:59:50.628
<v Josh Sparkes>reduce that rejection rate,
that would be great in capturing these</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22150-4
02:59:50.628 --> 02:59:53.017
<v Josh Sparkes>these datas, I mean these points.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22189-0
02:59:53.017 --> 02:59:56.472
<v Josh Sparkes>It might seem small,
but every one of them is an insight and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22189-1
02:59:56.472 --> 03:00:00.493
<v Josh Sparkes>it tells a picture. As you said,
it might be that it's always the same</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22165-0
03:00:00.377 --> 03:00:00.577
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22189-2
03:00:00.493 --> 03:00:03.495
<v Josh Sparkes>partner or it's always or the same client,
you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22172-0
03:00:03.297 --> 03:00:03.457
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22189-3
03:00:03.495 --> 03:00:07.857
<v Josh Sparkes>you get these and then you start to
answer questions that you can probe and.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22223-0
03:00:08.297 --> 03:00:13.117
<v Josh Sparkes>Everyone's part of Ashes,
it's part of the global community and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22223-1
03:00:13.117 --> 03:00:18.465
<v Josh Sparkes>they've got to model the challenges is
actually getting to the reason.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22223-2
03:00:18.465 --> 03:00:23.737
<v Josh Sparkes>I know that the guys do look at reversals,
but quite often it's it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22245-0
03:00:24.057 --> 03:00:27.618
<v Josh Sparkes>Be able to understand the reason for that
reversal,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22245-1
03:00:27.618 --> 03:00:31.796
<v Josh Sparkes>which is not necessarily documented.
I think Lauren tell me,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22245-2
03:00:31.796 --> 03:00:34.057
<v Josh Sparkes>is it documented in the Billings?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22293-0
03:00:37.657 --> 03:00:40.948
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So we try and get that data out of three</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22293-1
03:00:40.948 --> 03:00:45.851
<v Josh Sparkes>and obviously we don't want to replicate
3 E and you know the system,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22293-2
03:00:45.851 --> 03:00:51.594
<v Josh Sparkes>but I was just conscious of the date that
we receive it will not always be recent</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22293-3
03:00:51.594 --> 03:00:56.217
<v Josh Sparkes>and that therefore drives some of the
pressure to move it faster.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22341-0
03:00:56.217 --> 03:01:00.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Because we want the bill paid,
it's half year or it's year end or it's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22341-1
03:01:00.897 --> 03:01:05.907
<v Josh Sparkes>the client's year end or you know,
there's all these different combinations</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22311-0
03:01:03.097 --> 03:01:03.537
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22341-2
03:01:05.907 --> 03:01:10.521
<v Josh Sparkes>that could change the priority.
I think we've all been subjected that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22341-3
03:01:10.521 --> 03:01:13.817
<v Josh Sparkes>someone's delay becomes our obligation to
fix it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22334-0
03:01:13.897 --> 03:01:14.497
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22346-0
03:01:13.897 --> 03:01:16.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Which is something we want to change.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22394-0
03:01:15.497 --> 03:01:19.572
<v Mark Sedgey>Along the along those lines,
one of the things that you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22394-1
03:01:19.572 --> 03:01:24.632
<v Mark Sedgey>you might want to consider doing right,
even though it's not something we're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22394-2
03:01:24.632 --> 03:01:28.970
<v Mark Sedgey>going to solve right now,
but is is getting seniors to be able to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22394-3
03:01:28.970 --> 03:01:33.702
<v Mark Sedgey>start positioning where you're heading,
the importance of these things,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22394-4
03:01:33.702 --> 03:01:35.017
<v Mark Sedgey>what we're going to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22438-0
03:01:35.137 --> 03:01:35.577
<v Mark Sedgey>Stop.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22451-0
03:01:35.577 --> 03:01:40.274
<v Mark Sedgey>Measuring reporting on because you might
actually just by early signposting we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22451-1
03:01:40.274 --> 03:01:44.674
<v Mark Sedgey>might actually find that you can start
shifting behaviors if people think</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22451-2
03:01:44.674 --> 03:01:48.777
<v Mark Sedgey>they're going to get measured on
something and reported on etcetera.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22451-3
03:01:48.777 --> 03:01:52.167
<v Mark Sedgey>Because the other thing you can do
enclose your records.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22451-4
03:01:52.167 --> 03:01:55.497
<v Mark Sedgey>So if you're doing reversal you can you
know if that's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22483-0
03:01:56.337 --> 03:01:59.454
<v Mark Sedgey>Activities, you know,
can be captured or managed.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22483-1
03:01:59.454 --> 03:02:04.317
<v Mark Sedgey>I'm assuming it's going to be one of
these processes somewhere down the line.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22483-2
03:02:04.317 --> 03:02:07.870
<v Mark Sedgey>You can categorise the core,
the cause of that reversal,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22483-3
03:02:07.870 --> 03:02:10.177
<v Mark Sedgey>then again you can report against it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22527-0
03:02:12.297 --> 03:02:17.085
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just asked and just I've been that
partnership model before the is there any</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22527-1
03:02:17.085 --> 03:02:21.297
<v Josh Sparkes>kind of like practice leads or business
unity to so like any work that's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22527-2
03:02:21.297 --> 03:02:26.085
<v Josh Sparkes>remaining by March the 21st automatically
gets pushed through that gets claims and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22527-3
03:02:26.085 --> 03:02:27.297
<v Josh Sparkes>and we bill for that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22562-0
03:02:27.817 --> 03:02:36.618
<v Josh Sparkes>So the firm obviously wants to reduce its
lock up, you know, as much as possible.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22562-1
03:02:36.618 --> 03:02:45.097
<v Josh Sparkes>Therefore practice heads can be as bad as
yeah, you know, the challenges also.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22621-0
03:02:45.177 --> 03:02:50.138
<v Josh Sparkes>The types of deals that we run. So um,
if you think about not all deals,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22621-1
03:02:50.138 --> 03:02:55.370
<v Josh Sparkes>you could just bill every month, right?
We don't, you can't bill in advance,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22621-2
03:02:55.370 --> 03:03:00.196
<v Josh Sparkes>you can only bill in arrears.
It could be it's milestone billing or it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22621-3
03:03:00.196 --> 03:03:04.817
<v Josh Sparkes>could be end of end of the, you know,
the transaction that we bill.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22676-0
03:03:04.897 --> 03:03:08.983
<v Josh Sparkes>So what we're trying to do is help the
partners can actually put their</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22676-1
03:03:08.983 --> 03:03:12.206
<v Josh Sparkes>commercial head on.
Not that I'm saying partners aren't</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22676-2
03:03:12.206 --> 03:03:15.141
<v Josh Sparkes>commercial,
but there's a lot of them that are not</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22676-3
03:03:15.141 --> 03:03:19.112
<v Josh Sparkes>very commercial because they look at it
from a perspective of, well,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22676-4
03:03:19.112 --> 03:03:23.026
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm earning lots of money I charge,
so we must make a profit. Well,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22676-5
03:03:23.026 --> 03:03:24.177
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe not if you're.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22689-0
03:03:24.897 --> 03:03:30.100
<v Josh Sparkes>Doesn't come in for, you know, 18 months.
That deal's not been complete and we've</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22689-1
03:03:30.100 --> 03:03:33.337
<v Josh Sparkes>not received any money,
so it's a bit of a bounce.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22715-0
03:03:42.817 --> 03:03:49.957
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a bit of a balancing game, you know,
about billing regularly,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22715-1
03:03:49.957 --> 03:03:56.777
<v Josh Sparkes>but no false billing,
the ones that just go in the drawer it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22766-0
03:04:01.817 --> 03:04:04.354
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah,
that that that drives their own</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22766-1
03:04:04.354 --> 03:04:07.138
<v Josh Sparkes>behaviours.
Billing targets drives their own</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22766-2
03:04:07.138 --> 03:04:10.109
<v Josh Sparkes>behaviours.
Billing target drives them to bill,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22766-3
03:04:10.109 --> 03:04:14.193
<v Josh Sparkes>not necessarily to raise a bill, right.
So if you think about it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22766-4
03:04:14.193 --> 03:04:17.658
<v Josh Sparkes>we want to do is the target,
what we're trying to move,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22766-5
03:04:17.658 --> 03:04:20.257
<v Josh Sparkes>we've got billing and collections targets.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22810-0
03:04:20.577 --> 03:04:25.681
<v Josh Sparkes>And actually trying to encourage the
collections target on the basis that in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22810-1
03:04:25.681 --> 03:04:30.256
<v Josh Sparkes>order to collect you have to have raised
the bill. So focusing more,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22810-2
03:04:30.256 --> 03:04:34.167
<v Josh Sparkes>not quite got there yet in terms of
switching the tap off.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22787-0
03:04:31.057 --> 03:04:31.337
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22810-3
03:04:34.167 --> 03:04:37.150
<v Josh Sparkes>So at the moment they have a billing
target,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22810-4
03:04:37.150 --> 03:04:39.537
<v Josh Sparkes>they will have a collections target.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22826-0
03:04:39.977 --> 03:04:44.110
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, that's a classic case of, you know,
metrics and measures driving the wrong</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22826-1
03:04:44.110 --> 03:04:46.457
<v Mark Sedgey>behaviour that you're that you're
describing.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22825-0
03:04:45.537 --> 03:04:47.817
<v Josh Sparkes>Don't believe you're such right, Mark.
Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22897-0
03:04:48.777 --> 03:04:52.056
<v Josh Sparkes>Another legal firm I worked with the the
collection target.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22897-1
03:04:52.056 --> 03:04:56.318
<v Josh Sparkes>Every partner actually had a target and
if they were late or if there was any</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22897-2
03:04:56.318 --> 03:04:58.996
<v Josh Sparkes>delay,
there were two things that happened. One,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22897-3
03:04:58.996 --> 03:05:03.094
<v Josh Sparkes>there was a collective punishment.
So if you're in a particular op unit or</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22897-4
03:05:03.094 --> 03:05:07.193
<v Josh Sparkes>team, if one of you didn't hit it,
all of you were in the bad books. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22897-5
03:05:07.193 --> 03:05:08.177
<v Josh Sparkes>all never do that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22934-0
03:05:08.377 --> 03:05:11.722
<v Josh Sparkes>You charge the penalty.
So you say it's not real money,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22934-1
03:05:11.722 --> 03:05:14.350
<v Josh Sparkes>it's toy money or wooden money you can
say,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22934-2
03:05:14.350 --> 03:05:19.249
<v Josh Sparkes>but you say it's actually 5% of whatever
that value is. Something to think about.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22934-3
03:05:19.249 --> 03:05:23.371
<v Josh Sparkes>It's it's an interesting one,
not one that you'd have to convince me</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22934-4
03:05:23.371 --> 03:05:25.820
<v Josh Sparkes>about.
It's all the CEO that you need to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22934-5
03:05:25.820 --> 03:05:26.537
<v Josh Sparkes>convince me.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22968-0
03:05:27.337 --> 03:05:35.037
<v Josh Sparkes>Generally the punitive targets in place,
but very, very seldom. So for instance,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22968-1
03:05:35.037 --> 03:05:41.691
<v Josh Sparkes>if we if we look at in July,
we didn't hit our overall collections in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/22968-2
03:05:41.691 --> 03:05:42.737
<v Josh Sparkes>the target.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23006-0
03:05:42.937 --> 03:05:46.852
<v Josh Sparkes>And therefore part of drawings are
withheld, right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23006-1
03:05:46.852 --> 03:05:51.294
<v Josh Sparkes>So the drawings are withheld for the full
equity partners,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23006-2
03:05:51.294 --> 03:05:56.038
<v Josh Sparkes>not the partial equity partners and they
have to make that up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23006-3
03:05:56.038 --> 03:06:00.857
<v Josh Sparkes>So over in October now if they hit the
half year end then that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23038-0
03:06:00.937 --> 03:06:07.087
<v Josh Sparkes>Will get paid.
So it's not it's it's just gets delayed</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23038-1
03:06:07.087 --> 03:06:12.455
<v Josh Sparkes>payment.
That's it's not something that is done</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23038-2
03:06:12.455 --> 03:06:16.817
<v Josh Sparkes>often or punitively. I think it's more.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23094-0
03:06:17.097 --> 03:06:22.042
<v Josh Sparkes>A camaraderie of let's just lean in
together, let's get it done.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23094-1
03:06:22.042 --> 03:06:26.607
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's just something that I don't think
we can influence.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23094-2
03:06:26.607 --> 03:06:31.628
<v Josh Sparkes>We can provide statistics,
we can provide reports that helps like</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23094-3
03:06:31.628 --> 03:06:35.737
<v Josh Sparkes>the CEO, the CEO,
the ET to recognise the behaviours.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23155-0
03:06:35.817 --> 03:06:40.262
<v Josh Sparkes>And then go and have the words with the
division heads or the practice heads.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23155-1
03:06:40.262 --> 03:06:44.081
<v Josh Sparkes>Like my boss is quite often used as
somebody that goes and has the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23155-2
03:06:44.081 --> 03:06:47.956
<v Josh Sparkes>conversation with the real partners that
are maybe just sitting on.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23155-3
03:06:47.956 --> 03:06:52.459
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just getting raised, reversed,
raised, reversed, raised, reversed, right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23143-0
03:06:51.377 --> 03:06:52.777
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23155-4
03:06:52.459 --> 03:06:53.257
<v Josh Sparkes>Come on, guys.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23218-0
03:06:54.377 --> 03:06:57.751
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it really that way? Yeah.
That's what Zach was going to say is that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23150-0
03:06:54.857 --> 03:06:54.977
<v Mark Sedgey>Yep.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23218-1
03:06:57.751 --> 03:07:00.934
<v Josh Sparkes>we we're not going to be able to fix that
process as part of this,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23218-2
03:07:00.934 --> 03:07:04.308
<v Josh Sparkes>but how much insight can we give?
How much transformation can we give?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23218-3
03:07:04.308 --> 03:07:07.777
<v Josh Sparkes>The insight would be brilliant.
That would help my boss sort of bring it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23218-4
03:07:07.777 --> 03:07:10.058
<v Josh Sparkes>to the table and just demonstrate it.
You know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23218-5
03:07:10.058 --> 03:07:12.577
<v Josh Sparkes>this is the some of the behaviours that
we're, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23205-0
03:07:12.057 --> 03:07:12.337
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23258-0
03:07:13.017 --> 03:07:15.535
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think that's one of the things that
we need to think about.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23258-1
03:07:15.535 --> 03:07:18.713
<v Josh Sparkes>Are there additional data fields that we
want to add in there that can just allow</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23258-2
03:07:18.713 --> 03:07:21.890
<v Josh Sparkes>you to kind of have that conversation as
well and just kind of have a see you see</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23258-3
03:07:21.890 --> 03:07:24.254
<v Josh Sparkes>your conversation says look,
we've got all these metrics and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23258-4
03:07:24.254 --> 03:07:26.618
<v Josh Sparkes>statistics that shows us why this is
happening. Here you go.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23258-5
03:07:26.618 --> 03:07:27.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Now I'll go to that conversation.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23282-0
03:07:28.377 --> 03:07:31.845
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, yeah. Julian,
that was the point I was going to raise</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23260-0
03:07:29.377 --> 03:07:29.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23282-1
03:07:31.845 --> 03:07:36.469
<v Mark Sedgey>that as we're going through this to think
about any additional data captures to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23282-2
03:07:36.469 --> 03:07:38.897
<v Mark Sedgey>enable that very reporting. So good point.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23320-0
03:07:38.777 --> 03:07:42.300
<v Josh Sparkes>To go through them about now,
I'm going to go back to client onboarding</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23320-1
03:07:42.300 --> 03:07:45.285
<v Josh Sparkes>for additional fields.
Is there something within that client</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23320-2
03:07:45.285 --> 03:07:49.297
<v Josh Sparkes>onboarding that you can say they're going
to bill monthly, they're going to bill,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23320-3
03:07:49.297 --> 03:07:51.695
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
is there something that we can capture</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23320-4
03:07:51.695 --> 03:07:53.457
<v Josh Sparkes>upfront that gives you that insight?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23349-0
03:07:53.897 --> 03:07:58.781
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that something that we can add?
I'm just wondering if it's not on the NBI</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23349-1
03:07:58.781 --> 03:08:02.840
<v Josh Sparkes>forum. Do you hold on? It is on the NBI.
It's so much specific.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23349-2
03:08:02.840 --> 03:08:07.217
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be an ultimate plan.
I'll take Goldman Sachs, for instance.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23367-0
03:08:08.377 --> 03:08:11.487
<v Josh Sparkes>Most of the work in London's monthly
Australia,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23367-1
03:08:11.487 --> 03:08:16.737
<v Josh Sparkes>it's really on the monthly billing cycle,
but everything else in between can be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23420-0
03:08:18.417 --> 03:08:20.697
<v Josh Sparkes>Milestone,
it could be and dramatic could be when</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23420-1
03:08:20.697 --> 03:08:24.574
<v Josh Sparkes>we're in funds. So it really just depends,
but at least capturing what I'm saying is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23420-2
03:08:24.574 --> 03:08:28.360
<v Josh Sparkes>that there is the ability on that client
or boarding that we could capture some of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23420-3
03:08:28.360 --> 03:08:31.872
<v Josh Sparkes>those initial insights anyway that feeds
into the ongoing and then we're not</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23420-4
03:08:31.872 --> 03:08:33.377
<v Josh Sparkes>uploading an invoice for example.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23461-0
03:08:33.337 --> 03:08:37.661
<v Mark Sedgey>But it should come back to the contract.
It should be come come back to the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23426-0
03:08:33.497 --> 03:08:36.857
<v Josh Sparkes>If there is 6 log.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23461-1
03:08:37.661 --> 03:08:40.961
<v Mark Sedgey>contractual agreement.
Where is all the boundaries of the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23461-2
03:08:40.961 --> 03:08:44.716
<v Mark Sedgey>contract to agreement,
which usually says whether it's milestone,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23461-3
03:08:44.716 --> 03:08:49.097
<v Mark Sedgey>whether it's work complete or whether
it's monthly on timesheet or whatever.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23476-0
03:08:49.577 --> 03:08:52.557
<v Mark Sedgey>You know,
do that that sort of control of the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23476-1
03:08:52.557 --> 03:08:56.057
<v Mark Sedgey>contract and then using that to support
this process.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23478-0
03:08:57.577 --> 03:08:59.137
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, that's pretty key.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23525-0
03:09:00.057 --> 03:09:04.182
<v Josh Sparkes>So I I I've actually not seen the NBI for
myself, Mark,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23525-1
03:09:04.182 --> 03:09:09.929
<v Josh Sparkes>but I'm going to go away at some point
today and dig it out actually and just</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23525-2
03:09:09.929 --> 03:09:15.897
<v Josh Sparkes>see how much information is captured in
terms of the the terms and how you know.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23541-0
03:09:14.617 --> 03:09:18.447
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, because it might,
it might be that adjusting something up</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23541-1
03:09:18.447 --> 03:09:22.337
<v Mark Sedgey>front in there to grab that then helps
you downstream processes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23591-0
03:09:20.417 --> 03:09:24.421
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, you would not.
Don't say try and get the NBI form.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23591-1
03:09:24.421 --> 03:09:30.172
<v Josh Sparkes>I've had one of my peers has spent two
years negotiating just to get a tick on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23591-2
03:09:30.172 --> 03:09:35.705
<v Josh Sparkes>the box to see that the e-billing.
It's an e-billing client. Is that right,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23565-0
03:09:32.577 --> 03:09:33.297
<v Mark Sedgey>Oh, wow.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23591-3
03:09:35.705 --> 03:09:38.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Lauren? I think Sam was on this for two.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23626-0
03:09:40.497 --> 03:09:44.814
<v Josh Sparkes>Two years trying to just get a box
changed on the NBI form.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23626-1
03:09:44.814 --> 03:09:50.283
<v Josh Sparkes>Did you get it changed? We we did,
but it's been two years of how it's log.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23626-2
03:09:50.283 --> 03:09:53.594
<v Josh Sparkes>So um,
trying to get that NBI form changed is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23626-3
03:09:53.594 --> 03:09:55.177
<v Josh Sparkes>not something that um.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23655-0
03:09:55.417 --> 03:10:00.584
<v Josh Sparkes>Is easily done, unfortunately.
I think it was probably to Mark's point</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23633-0
03:09:56.777 --> 03:09:58.417
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23655-1
03:10:00.584 --> 03:10:06.188
<v Josh Sparkes>of extracting the information within that.
Yeah, that we can leverage. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23655-2
03:10:06.188 --> 03:10:11.137
<v Josh Sparkes>I was going to ask this earlier and I'm
maybe just going to expose.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23656-0
03:10:11.857 --> 03:10:11.977
<v Josh Sparkes>Pop.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23692-0
03:10:14.417 --> 03:10:20.744
<v Josh Sparkes>And obviously we did billing on Friday,
but in the process billing comes before</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23692-1
03:10:20.744 --> 03:10:24.462
<v Josh Sparkes>e-billing.
So maybe really oversimplifying it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23692-2
03:10:24.462 --> 03:10:28.891
<v Josh Sparkes>but is there a way where if somebody
requests the bill,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23692-3
03:10:28.891 --> 03:10:31.897
<v Josh Sparkes>so ServiceNow is a request for a bill.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23726-0
03:10:32.537 --> 03:10:37.994
<v Josh Sparkes>And we also know that this client is an
e-billing client and when that bill is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23726-1
03:10:37.994 --> 03:10:43.382
<v Josh Sparkes>that request is raised and then it is
fulfilled by the billing team that then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23726-2
03:10:43.382 --> 03:10:48.977
<v Josh Sparkes>it becomes an approval request to have a
practice executive, somebody like that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23769-0
03:10:49.417 --> 03:10:52.217
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the triggers the e-billing
request.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23769-1
03:10:52.217 --> 03:10:57.446
<v Josh Sparkes>Without that kind of request having to be
placed on the portal and obviously it was</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23769-2
03:10:57.446 --> 03:11:02.612
<v Josh Sparkes>rejected and gets a vandal or something,
but is there a way that we can maybe link</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23769-3
03:11:02.612 --> 03:11:04.977
<v Josh Sparkes>the billing and the e-billing request?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23805-0
03:11:05.737 --> 03:11:08.890
<v Josh Sparkes>To a make it one for the request rather
than two,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23805-1
03:11:08.890 --> 03:11:13.431
<v Josh Sparkes>and then also possibly eliminate some of
this dead space in the middle,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23805-2
03:11:13.431 --> 03:11:18.035
<v Josh Sparkes>notwithstanding what said about, you know,
the potential seven day rule,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23805-3
03:11:18.035 --> 03:11:20.937
<v Josh Sparkes>but even just as it stands,
we'll link those.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23846-0
03:11:21.177 --> 03:11:24.131
<v Josh Sparkes>Do we,
do we maybe make that easier and reduce</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23846-1
03:11:24.131 --> 03:11:27.022
<v Josh Sparkes>some of the the lock up time? Yes,
certainly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23846-2
03:11:27.022 --> 03:11:31.800
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we've got all the process.
I know that we're doing work streams and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23846-3
03:11:31.800 --> 03:11:36.388
<v Josh Sparkes>that we're in this order. You're right,
we'll we don't want to make them</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23846-4
03:11:36.388 --> 03:11:37.017
<v Josh Sparkes>exclusive.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23887-0
03:11:37.337 --> 03:11:41.612
<v Josh Sparkes>Activity and once we've probably got to
the end of the week and we've got it all</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23887-1
03:11:41.612 --> 03:11:44.674
<v Josh Sparkes>together in the right,
it will be where we're joining it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23887-2
03:11:44.674 --> 03:11:48.422
<v Josh Sparkes>That's the entry point to that.
That will trigger that really just the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23887-3
03:11:48.422 --> 03:11:51.853
<v Josh Sparkes>work for accordingly,
but certainly that's on our radar as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23887-4
03:11:51.853 --> 03:11:54.017
<v Josh Sparkes>So we only have centralized point for UK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23917-0
03:11:55.337 --> 03:12:02.216
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So every other country,
it's decentralized and driven by the so</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23917-1
03:12:02.216 --> 03:12:06.737
<v Josh Sparkes>practice executive and not through the
paths.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23933-0
03:12:08.537 --> 03:12:15.383
<v Josh Sparkes>So we only deal with the UK and even at
that we allow them to do some of their</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23933-1
03:12:15.383 --> 03:12:17.377
<v Josh Sparkes>own billing themselves.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23934-0
03:12:18.657 --> 03:12:18.777
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23964-0
03:12:22.737 --> 03:12:27.280
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
we might want to break for lunch shortly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23964-1
03:12:27.280 --> 03:12:33.503
<v Josh Sparkes>The only thing we didn't touch on. Yeah,
notifications. Again,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/23964-2
03:12:33.503 --> 03:12:37.257
<v Josh Sparkes>notifications on different activities.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24007-0
03:12:38.377 --> 03:12:43.386
<v Josh Sparkes>Notifications back to the client if it's
done or you know anything like that or at</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24007-1
03:12:43.386 --> 03:12:47.369
<v Josh Sparkes>the moment as you said,
following all of your activities is going</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24007-2
03:12:47.369 --> 03:12:51.352
<v Josh Sparkes>to be group dashboard. Anyway,
what's come in you're getting that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24007-3
03:12:51.352 --> 03:12:55.697
<v Josh Sparkes>notification aren't you pretty cool
because the window is open already.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24035-0
03:12:56.057 --> 03:13:00.636
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's that handshake back or how we
managed. We don't go back.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24035-1
03:13:00.636 --> 03:13:05.908
<v Josh Sparkes>The fact that it's done it and the
window's closed and it's probably picked</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24035-2
03:13:05.908 --> 03:13:11.389
<v Josh Sparkes>up on the next approval window. Yeah,
once it's closed. If we haven't done it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24035-3
03:13:11.389 --> 03:13:12.777
<v Josh Sparkes>the climate will be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24036-0
03:13:14.017 --> 03:13:14.297
<v Josh Sparkes>So.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24071-0
03:13:16.617 --> 03:13:20.926
<v Josh Sparkes>It's notifications,
but our own say if we've got a deadline</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24071-1
03:13:20.926 --> 03:13:24.804
<v Josh Sparkes>date, if it triggers,
I know 24 hours before closing.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24071-2
03:13:24.804 --> 03:13:28.969
<v Josh Sparkes>So we know, yes,
got it just in case it slips through the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24071-3
03:13:28.969 --> 03:13:29.257
<v Josh Sparkes>net.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24107-0
03:13:31.777 --> 03:13:36.436
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's still like an outstanding request
that we haven't closed down,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24107-1
03:13:36.436 --> 03:13:41.227
<v Josh Sparkes>your dashboard could be, you know,
breaching that you can get, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24107-2
03:13:41.227 --> 03:13:46.411
<v Josh Sparkes>that would be clear and on the third one
of your dashboard for anything that's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24107-3
03:13:46.411 --> 03:13:48.577
<v Josh Sparkes>about to close or to be breached.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24155-0
03:13:48.817 --> 03:13:52.261
<v Josh Sparkes>Becomes priority. Yeah,
that'd be very good together.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24155-1
03:13:52.261 --> 03:13:57.428
<v Josh Sparkes>There could be could be sitting with me
and I know it gets to you guys tomorrow.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24155-2
03:13:57.428 --> 03:14:02.403
<v Josh Sparkes>I'd be coming tomorrow and somewhere
they're using that trigger and that will</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24155-3
03:14:02.403 --> 03:14:06.167
<v Josh Sparkes>all be displaced. So it doesn't.
Nobody becomes a walking.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24155-4
03:14:06.167 --> 03:14:08.017
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that the activity is.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24143-0
03:14:06.417 --> 03:14:06.857
<v Mark Sedgey>Just.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24194-0
03:14:08.017 --> 03:14:13.908
<v Josh Sparkes>Especially this, if we don't submit it,
then we'll find us 10,000 lbs.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24152-0
03:14:09.217 --> 03:14:09.977
<v Mark Sedgey>Josh.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24194-1
03:14:13.908 --> 03:14:19.466
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's quite important.
If we don't submit our rate, the accrual,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24167-0
03:14:14.897 --> 03:14:15.217
<v Mark Sedgey>And.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24173-0
03:14:18.337 --> 03:14:18.977
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24194-2
03:14:19.466 --> 03:14:24.611
<v Josh Sparkes>they will find us 10,
000 so month for every every month that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24181-0
03:14:22.857 --> 03:14:23.097
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24194-3
03:14:24.611 --> 03:14:27.017
<v Josh Sparkes>we don't submit the rate for.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24216-0
03:14:27.377 --> 03:14:33.216
<v Josh Sparkes>So they can refuse to pay any worse.
And what's that percentage?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24216-1
03:14:33.216 --> 03:14:37.977
<v Josh Sparkes>How often does that?
We haven't had it yet in years.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24254-0
03:14:36.177 --> 03:14:40.551
<v Mark Sedgey>So just sorry Josh,
just on the wording of that you you you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24218-0
03:14:39.497 --> 03:14:39.737
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24254-1
03:14:40.551 --> 03:14:43.831
<v Mark Sedgey>want,
you want the system to make it working</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24254-2
03:14:43.831 --> 03:14:49.298
<v Mark Sedgey>hours so that you don't get 24 hours on a
Saturday, you know on a weekday.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24254-3
03:14:49.298 --> 03:14:51.777
<v Mark Sedgey>So that needs to be working hours.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24269-0
03:14:52.337 --> 03:14:54.593
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes,
some of our windows shut out over the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24269-1
03:14:54.593 --> 03:14:58.057
<v Josh Sparkes>weekend helpfully well through bank
holidays and stuff like that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24287-0
03:14:56.257 --> 03:15:00.648
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
So what what that mean is you get the you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24287-1
03:15:00.648 --> 03:15:04.857
<v Mark Sedgey>get the notification with enough work
days to be able to recover it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24295-0
03:15:04.977 --> 03:15:07.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Could go, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24314-0
03:15:05.937 --> 03:15:09.736
<v Parik Narain>That's a good point, Mark.
And I think that that rule applies to our</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24314-1
03:15:09.736 --> 03:15:12.214
<v Parik Narain>SLAS as well across ITSI and others as
well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24314-2
03:15:12.214 --> 03:15:14.857
<v Parik Narain>It's all working hours for the teams not,
yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24312-0
03:15:12.217 --> 03:15:12.777
<v Josh Sparkes>Thanks.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24309-0
03:15:12.497 --> 03:15:13.017
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24332-0
03:15:16.697 --> 03:15:21.858
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, perfect. Went in a few areas there,
but all good stuff.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24332-1
03:15:21.858 --> 03:15:24.697
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we've covered everything.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24336-0
03:15:26.137 --> 03:15:27.577
<v Josh Sparkes>Clear on.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24361-0
03:15:29.177 --> 03:15:33.605
<v Josh Sparkes>Everything in that process. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Um, as I said,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24361-1
03:15:33.605 --> 03:15:38.694
<v Josh Sparkes>I can't if you'd be aware of this window
that you've got the item. Yeah. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24361-2
03:15:38.694 --> 03:15:42.726
<v Josh Sparkes>that's good. Thank you.
You've got to do that very well. Um,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24361-3
03:15:42.726 --> 03:15:44.577
<v Josh Sparkes>that's some of the triggers.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24377-0
03:15:44.817 --> 03:15:49.105
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So a few things to follow up on,
but again,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24377-1
03:15:49.105 --> 03:15:54.937
<v Josh Sparkes>generally what we've talked about if we
put that into action, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24398-0
03:15:57.537 --> 03:16:00.194
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
I think we definitely need a quick break.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24398-1
03:16:00.194 --> 03:16:03.257
<v Josh Sparkes>Should we go for lunch? Where are we at?
It was one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24418-0
03:16:07.777 --> 03:16:14.021
<v Josh Sparkes>Early lunch? Yeah. OK, all right.
And we thought, yeah, we have to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24418-1
03:16:14.021 --> 03:16:18.796
<v Josh Sparkes>All right,
let's prepare ourselves for invoices and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24418-2
03:16:18.796 --> 03:16:22.377
<v Josh Sparkes>take a lunch then. Yeah, for reasoning.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24431-0
03:16:22.977 --> 03:16:27.698
<v Josh Sparkes>Um, the pain points of that. So, yeah,
yeah. Thank you. Thank you this morning.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24431-1

<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, thanks. So 1:15 returns.
Is that OK with everyone? Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24432-0
03:16:31.217 --> 03:16:32.697
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, sounds good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24433-0
03:16:32.617 --> 03:16:33.017
<v Parik Narain>Yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24438-0
03:16:35.257 --> 03:16:35.777
<v Josh Sparkes>All right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24441-0
03:16:35.817 --> 03:16:37.097
<v Parik Narain>Thank you. Thank you. See you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24455-0
03:16:41.937 --> 03:16:53.057
<v Josh Sparkes>Right. Thank you very much. Yeah, 1:15.
OK, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24456-0
03:16:57.097 --> 03:16:57.657
<v Josh Sparkes>That.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24460-0
03:17:04.217 --> 03:17:09.897
<v Josh Sparkes>All right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24482-0
03:17:28.537 --> 03:17:45.617
<v Josh Sparkes>So OK, that should be OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24484-0
03:17:48.177 --> 03:17:52.417
<v Josh Sparkes>One, yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24493-0
03:17:54.057 --> 03:18:06.577
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just absolutely obvious.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24497-0
03:18:09.937 --> 03:18:14.697
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I think I'm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24501-0
03:18:17.897 --> 03:18:30.697
<v Josh Sparkes>No, because.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24506-0
03:18:31.857 --> 03:18:46.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24547-0
03:19:09.377 --> 03:19:24.362
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you. I'm a T level. I'll see that.
Yeah, that'd be worse than this. I know.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24547-1
03:19:24.362 --> 03:19:29.297
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm really shortly as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24561-0
03:19:30.217 --> 03:19:49.057
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a whole pot,
then I'll put it back one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24591-0
03:19:49.177 --> 03:19:49.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24598-0
03:19:50.297 --> 03:20:02.127
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, really? I think I'm doing that. Oh,
I see what you mean.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24598-1
03:20:02.127 --> 03:20:09.497
<v Josh Sparkes>I think I use it as my mouth. It's my.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24629-0
03:20:09.617 --> 03:20:19.570
<v Josh Sparkes>Actually, you know,
the coffee or the kitchen was a little</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24629-1
03:20:19.570 --> 03:20:29.017
<v Josh Sparkes>bit. You get to hear shows and sort of.
I mean, I mean.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24634-0
03:20:29.697 --> 03:20:35.577
<v Josh Sparkes>No, it's probably not. It's not.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24650-0
03:20:37.457 --> 03:20:45.875
<v Josh Sparkes>It's always something for anyone to see.
It's always something. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24650-1
03:20:45.875 --> 03:20:52.490
<v Josh Sparkes>I say the complaints department
initiative at 7:00 PM,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24650-2
03:20:52.490 --> 03:20:55.617
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's always something.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24686-0
03:20:55.777 --> 03:21:03.546
<v Josh Sparkes>She she has to go up.
I think my mom did say that at the end of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24686-1
03:21:03.546 --> 03:21:13.137
<v Josh Sparkes>the day. If you got that she increased.
So you haven't told me that. I'm just.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24703-0
03:21:13.737 --> 03:21:29.211
<v Josh Sparkes>And it seems to me,
so I'm obviously allowed. I have,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24703-1
03:21:29.211 --> 03:21:32.937
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't have.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24723-0
03:21:33.417 --> 03:21:53.137
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, it's the best. No, thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24748-0
03:21:53.137 --> 03:22:02.324
<v Josh Sparkes>I definitely wasn't because it's,
you know, it's next 20,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24748-1
03:22:02.324 --> 03:22:12.937
<v Josh Sparkes>so I don't know what it is,
but I didn't know how. I just took my.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24782-0
03:22:13.617 --> 03:22:21.679
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's something going out.
Are you coming up for lunch? Yes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24782-1
03:22:21.679 --> 03:22:29.860
<v Josh Sparkes>it's coming up. Yeah, I know.
I'll have something to do now that I'm</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24782-2
03:22:29.860 --> 03:22:33.417
<v Josh Sparkes>going to walk it up otherwise.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24803-0
03:22:33.617 --> 03:22:49.857
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, no, it's more.
And there's always something.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24806-0
03:22:52.057 --> 03:22:53.977
<v Josh Sparkes>We're leaving.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24809-0
03:22:55.377 --> 03:23:05.057
<v Josh Sparkes>It's this coming. I just can't.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24811-0
03:23:06.937 --> 03:23:11.177
<v Josh Sparkes>He's speaking, said. I've moved her laser.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24836-0
03:23:13.097 --> 03:23:22.942
<v Josh Sparkes>It would just.
So like that's what he's doing and it's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24836-1
03:23:22.942 --> 03:23:31.177
<v Josh Sparkes>certainly this.
I think it's on the language.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24880-0
03:23:49.137 --> 03:23:58.546
<v Josh Sparkes>It's become from a position of privilege.
Yeah, one privilege approach. He don't.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24880-1
03:23:58.546 --> 03:24:00.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, understand.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24904-0
03:24:01.137 --> 03:24:15.977
<v Josh Sparkes>She has to and and as I don't know
everything.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24929-0
03:24:16.497 --> 03:24:24.952
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's just getting people on site
today. It's like what happened on Friday.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24929-1
03:24:24.952 --> 03:24:32.017
<v Josh Sparkes>And you know it's natural to and do when
you're I think we start.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24948-0
03:24:32.657 --> 03:24:38.822
<v Josh Sparkes>You don't know.
I don't know because there was no,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24948-1
03:24:38.822 --> 03:24:45.592
<v Josh Sparkes>there was no,
there was no nothing to see that that was</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24948-2
03:24:45.592 --> 03:24:48.977
<v Josh Sparkes>whether we find the problem.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24974-0
03:24:49.417 --> 03:24:56.386
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
actually I don't have a conference,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24974-1
03:24:56.386 --> 03:25:09.057
<v Josh Sparkes>but like I was here and then the person I
was in the car, I to see was driving.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/24988-0
03:25:09.137 --> 03:25:17.937
<v Josh Sparkes>And we have to be advocating still quite
a bit, but then they actually.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25005-0
03:25:18.617 --> 03:25:24.880
<v Josh Sparkes>Because I think it's wrong because it's
about the support and that and they just</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25005-1
03:25:24.880 --> 03:25:28.437
<v Josh Sparkes>need to think that. So no,
it's exactly that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25005-2
03:25:28.437 --> 03:25:33.540
<v Josh Sparkes>But I think it's connected to not so it's
been like that already.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25005-3
03:25:33.540 --> 03:25:38.257
<v Josh Sparkes>So you have to continue this.
So sometimes at least you get.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25017-0
03:25:38.257 --> 03:25:53.737
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that's it. Yeah, that's it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25052-0
03:25:54.457 --> 03:26:05.822
<v Josh Sparkes>You kind of have to.
You have to go through those pencils.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25052-1
03:26:05.822 --> 03:26:09.097
<v Josh Sparkes>She just doesn't.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25066-0
03:26:10.137 --> 03:26:14.675
<v Josh Sparkes>People think, I think somewhere,
somewhere on social media.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25066-1
03:26:14.675 --> 03:26:17.777
<v Josh Sparkes>A lot of people she was getting messages.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25078-0
03:26:18.937 --> 03:26:26.377
<v Josh Sparkes>Somebody that she.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25105-0
03:26:27.537 --> 03:26:36.769
<v Josh Sparkes>We can't. It's like, I hope. Yeah,
we want to piece it all together. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25105-1
03:26:36.769 --> 03:26:45.017
<v Josh Sparkes>but it just anchors. So she's nice.
That's why I said she's tired.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25130-0
03:26:45.137 --> 03:27:03.657
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, unfortunately, yeah, I'm not,
but she just doesn't want to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25152-0
03:27:04.017 --> 03:27:18.162
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, well, sorry. No, that makes sense.
And up until she wants to let me know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25152-1
03:27:18.162 --> 03:27:19.577
<v Josh Sparkes>I think.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25162-0
03:27:22.417 --> 03:27:25.977
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, actually, yeah,
it's hard to keep to do.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25174-0
03:27:28.617 --> 03:27:43.937
<v Josh Sparkes>My audience question to be asked.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25206-0
03:27:45.457 --> 03:27:52.345
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't. I just. Yeah.
And I'll chat to change something.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25206-1
03:27:52.345 --> 03:28:01.370
<v Josh Sparkes>I think I'll be doing the other sessions
as I say. I need to be kick. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25206-2
03:28:01.370 --> 03:28:04.577
<v Josh Sparkes>how to be told to managers.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25233-0
03:28:04.577 --> 03:28:10.682
<v Josh Sparkes>So that when they come in to bring,
they come in and says this is my solution.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25233-1
03:28:10.682 --> 03:28:16.787
<v Josh Sparkes>It's supposed to you're just asking me a
stream of questions and if it doesn't</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25233-2
03:28:16.787 --> 03:28:19.337
<v Josh Sparkes>work, you will ask me a question.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25238-0
03:28:19.617 --> 03:28:25.937
<v Josh Sparkes>That's my big question, I think.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25261-0
03:28:27.217 --> 03:28:46.937
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't understand.
I don't think it's like we're making.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25263-0
03:28:49.417 --> 03:28:51.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it's perfect.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25266-0

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25282-0

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25327-0

<v Josh Sparkes>I know I wanted to see the castle.
I'm so busy. I'll have to take it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25364-0
03:29:44.577 --> 03:29:54.574
<v Josh Sparkes>It's because you've got to have terms
since the end of the Scottish.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25364-1
03:29:54.574 --> 03:30:02.977
<v Josh Sparkes>The only ones that go into the tartan
shops and the cash.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25389-0

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25389-2
03:30:14.125 --> 03:30:19.377
<v Josh Sparkes>I just have a look. I went up the shop,
but I was full all night.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25409-0
03:30:19.377 --> 03:30:25.449
<v Josh Sparkes>It's it's quite clean actually.
It's just it was it's beautiful.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25409-1
03:30:25.449 --> 03:30:32.735
<v Josh Sparkes>But I was just thinking like clearing
power and I said that's it's during the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25409-2
03:30:32.735 --> 03:30:34.977
<v Josh Sparkes>festival. You literally.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25442-0
03:30:35.257 --> 03:30:42.503
<v Josh Sparkes>Camel walks like that with St.
artists as well as it's by the nights,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25442-1
03:30:42.503 --> 03:30:49.128
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's a bit intense.
But it's a lot because when I walked to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25442-2
03:30:49.128 --> 03:30:54.097
<v Josh Sparkes>the restaurant on Thursday night,
it was right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25482-0
03:30:54.897 --> 03:30:58.506

03:30:58.506 --> 03:31:03.654
<v Josh Sparkes>like 6 portions and you need off the
space things. Sorry, it's so not funny.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25482-2
03:31:03.654 --> 03:31:09.135
<v Josh Sparkes>It kept popping up with my social media.
It looked really. I've never been to it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25482-3
03:31:09.135 --> 03:31:13.681

I only talked to you by, but so this like,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25482-4

<v Josh Sparkes>So you kind of got a rain, oh,

<v Josh Sparkes>She said that she's having a comment.
It's happy. Just in a quick 2020 minutes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25578-0

03:31:58.794 --> 03:32:05.737
<v Josh Sparkes>talking to some actions and I said listen.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25598-0

03:32:15.884 --> 03:32:25.017
<v Josh Sparkes>and that was trying to get them to use a
system. That's it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25623-0
03:32:25.657 --> 03:32:31.503
<v Josh Sparkes>So it would be team, my team,
if we're doing sales and interest season,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/25623-1
03:32:31.503 --> 03:32:36.861
