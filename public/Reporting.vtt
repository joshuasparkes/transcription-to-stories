00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:08.017
<v Josh Sparkes>Recording on share screen on.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/315-0
00:00:10.617 --> 00:00:13.651
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
So this is the the broad view Emma down</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/315-1
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:18.961
<v Josh Sparkes>the left there some of those success
metrics that we we hope to get from the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/286-0
00:00:16.577 --> 00:00:16.897
<v Hall, Emma 14831>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/315-2
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:23.030
<v Josh Sparkes>the program and why we're doing this the
top on the right.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/315-3
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.857
<v Josh Sparkes>So these are the the typical reasons why.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/357-0
00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:30.749
<v Josh Sparkes>Ask may get queries in from from the
organisation and we're implementing that</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/357-1
00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.630
<v Josh Sparkes>system across the bottom layer.
They're the different channels that</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/357-2
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.683
<v Josh Sparkes>employees can request by at the moment.
So telephony, e-mail, walk up,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/357-3
00:00:38.683 --> 00:00:41.537
<v Josh Sparkes>they'll still be there as part of this
programme.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/416-0
00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:46.570
<v Josh Sparkes>And in this phase one kind of focus on
employee centre and implementing a very</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/416-1
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.854
<v Josh Sparkes>good experience for employees to to make
requests as of ask and the the IT</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/416-2
00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:53.939
<v Josh Sparkes>department.
So a lot of this call will be focusing on</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/416-3
00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:58.623
<v Josh Sparkes>actually what how employee centre will be
set up to do that for for ask reporting</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/416-4
00:00:58.623 --> 00:00:59.137
<v Josh Sparkes>requests.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/465-0
00:00:59.737 --> 00:01:04.263
<v Josh Sparkes>And then just below that in the orange
there all the functions that are in scope</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/465-1
00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:07.895
<v Josh Sparkes>and across the bottom is a little bit
about the the tool itself.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/465-2
00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:10.689
<v Josh Sparkes>So ServiceNow able to integrate with many
things.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/465-3
00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.935
<v Josh Sparkes>Mature platform has many workflows that
can be designed and built in there,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/465-4
00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:17.897
<v Josh Sparkes>which is what we're going to look at
today actually.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/485-0
00:01:18.217 --> 00:01:23.062
<v Josh Sparkes>So hopefully it comes a bit more to life
when I when I get into the the bulk of it.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/485-1
00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:26.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Any questions at this stage, Emma,
should we move on?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/484-0
00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:27.217
<v Hall, Emma 14831>No, not at this point, thanks.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/556-0
00:01:27.977 --> 00:01:32.547
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I think the only bit I would add, Josh,
just for Emma's benefit is the biggest</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/492-0
00:01:28.097 --> 00:01:28.977
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, cool.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/498-0
00:01:30.617 --> 00:01:30.897
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/556-1
00:01:32.547 --> 00:01:37.116
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>problem change with ServiceNow to share
well for you guys will be how requests</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/556-2
00:01:37.116 --> 00:01:39.893
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>come in.
So we will have a portal this time and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/520-0
00:01:38.617 --> 00:01:39.057
<v Hall, Emma 14831>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/556-3
00:01:39.893 --> 00:01:44.578
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>that's the way that we'll be looking for
the firm and our stakeholders to engage</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/556-4
00:01:44.578 --> 00:01:47.817
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>with us rather than send an e-mail.
So we'll hopefully.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/596-0
00:01:47.897 --> 00:01:52.108
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>They have a bit more control over what
kind of information we gather from our</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/563-0
00:01:51.697 --> 00:01:52.337
<v Hall, Emma 14831>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/596-1
00:01:52.108 --> 00:01:55.347
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>requesters, etcetera.
So that's what these kind of sessions</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/596-2
00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:58.802
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>have been leading up to,
to understand the process a little bit</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/596-3
00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:02.257
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>better and what kind of information we
can gather in there, so.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/606-0
00:02:03.177 --> 00:02:07.253
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>It's just kind of following on from that.
It's good just to have context that</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/599-0
00:02:04.897 --> 00:02:05.057
<v Hall, Emma 14831>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/606-1
00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:08.977
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>that's how requests will come in.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/647-0
00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:13.061
<v Josh Sparkes>Thanks, Joe,
and happy to kind of show you how the the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/647-1
00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Josh Sparkes>employee centre works, Emma,
but there'll be training as part of this</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/647-2
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.257
<v Josh Sparkes>programme.
We will have a lot of time in the system</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/647-3
00:02:20.257 --> 00:02:23.737
<v Josh Sparkes>to to see how it how it works and how to
use it, etcetera.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/642-0
00:02:24.457 --> 00:02:24.577
<v Hall, Emma 14831>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/684-0
00:02:25.857 --> 00:02:31.876
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, cool. So today, yeah, as I said,
we we we discussed with Stephen and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/684-1
00:02:31.876 --> 00:02:38.391
<v Josh Sparkes>Gordon and Wayne over the past couple of
weeks about how we could go about the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/684-2
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.617
<v Josh Sparkes>requesting for for reports.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/731-0
00:02:41.177 --> 00:02:46.654
<v Josh Sparkes>We initially said we could just offer
users a drop down with the different</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/731-1
00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:51.984
<v Josh Sparkes>reports available and then ask them if
they want to create a new report.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/731-2
00:02:51.984 --> 00:02:56.438
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's not on the list, of course,
edit an existing report,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/731-3
00:02:56.438 --> 00:02:58.337
<v Josh Sparkes>delete an existing report.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/781-0
00:02:58.857 --> 00:03:03.055
<v Josh Sparkes>Or have an extract from a existing report
and the feedback we got was that we</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/781-1
00:03:03.055 --> 00:03:07.253
<v Josh Sparkes>actually want to make it a bit more
simple for users if they didn't know what</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/781-2
00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:10.105
<v Josh Sparkes>they wanted.
So I built this to try and capture both</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/781-3
00:03:10.105 --> 00:03:14.142
<v Josh Sparkes>tracks. So if they know what they want,
if they know the report they want,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/781-4
00:03:14.142 --> 00:03:15.057
<v Josh Sparkes>or if they don't.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/840-0
00:03:15.537 --> 00:03:20.097
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm kind of just going to walk through
the logic of of how that could work in</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/840-1
00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:23.475
<v Josh Sparkes>the portal essentially.
So what I'm proposing is a a single</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/840-2
00:03:23.475 --> 00:03:27.697
<v Josh Sparkes>catalog item or form in the in the portal
called Manage Reports. And yeah,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/840-3
00:03:27.697 --> 00:03:30.906
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll just kind of read it because it's
the clearest way.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/840-4
00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:35.297
<v Josh Sparkes>Users would complete a simple form and
starts by asking what they want to do.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/897-0
00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:39.985
<v Josh Sparkes>And for existing report requests that
would indicate they know the report or</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/897-1
00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:44.375
<v Josh Sparkes>not. If they do then provide it.
If not then they describe their need and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/897-2
00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:48.171
<v Josh Sparkes>the team would need to identify it and
kind of consult on that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/897-3
00:03:48.171 --> 00:03:52.977
<v Josh Sparkes>Requests would land with the reporting
team queue where you'll be able to review</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/897-4
00:03:52.977 --> 00:03:54.697
<v Josh Sparkes>self assign and work on them.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/944-0
00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:58.331
<v Josh Sparkes>We did look at automatic assignment last
time we spoke.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/944-1
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:02.393
<v Josh Sparkes>I think with the conclusion we came to
was that we want to manually assign,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/944-2
00:04:02.393 --> 00:04:05.922
<v Josh Sparkes>land them in the queue,
team sees them and we can manually assign</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/944-3
00:04:05.922 --> 00:04:09.984
<v Josh Sparkes>them as needed and we'll be able to
automatically send notifications to who</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/944-4
00:04:09.984 --> 00:04:12.497
<v Josh Sparkes>we want.
I think at the moment I was thinking.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1000-0
00:04:12.857 --> 00:04:17.063
<v Josh Sparkes>If we go with an e-mail notification to
the requester, maybe when it's submitted,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1000-1
00:04:17.063 --> 00:04:20.192
<v Josh Sparkes>when it's completed,
but that's kind of preliminary thought.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1000-2
00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:24.039
<v Josh Sparkes>I know there's a broader view about where
do we want to be sending emails,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1000-3
00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.040
<v Josh Sparkes>so I wouldn't take that as as gospel.
I think it would we need to be fed into</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1000-4
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.297
<v Josh Sparkes>from the broader approach on
notifications.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1045-0
00:04:31.097 --> 00:04:34.781
<v Josh Sparkes>But in the employee centre,
as some of you may know,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1045-1
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:40.343
<v Josh Sparkes>anyone that makes the request will have a
list of requests they've historically</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1045-2
00:04:40.343 --> 00:04:43.471
<v Josh Sparkes>made.
If there's been any response to those,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1045-3
00:04:43.471 --> 00:04:47.017
<v Josh Sparkes>if it's been completed or if it's had any
kind of.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1098-0
00:04:47.097 --> 00:04:50.644
<v Josh Sparkes>Questions on it,
then the user can engage with an agent in</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1098-1
00:04:50.644 --> 00:04:54.432
<v Josh Sparkes>the employee centre.
So there might not be a need for a e-mail</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1098-2
00:04:54.432 --> 00:04:57.859
<v Josh Sparkes>all the time if the requester is in the
employee centre.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1098-3
00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:02.368
<v Josh Sparkes>Just another one of the benefits it
brings on the other benefits here. OK,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1098-4
00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:06.457
<v Josh Sparkes>that leads nicely into it,
so this will give you better visibility.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1148-0
00:05:06.857 --> 00:05:09.442
<v Josh Sparkes>On demand,
you'll be able to see what requests are</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1148-1
00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:11.875
<v Josh Sparkes>getting,
what type of what reports are getting,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1148-2
00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:15.929
<v Josh Sparkes>what type of requests will reduce back
and forth emails because as I mentioned,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1148-3
00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:20.034
<v Josh Sparkes>you'll be able to go back and forth in
the employee center if needed and it will</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1148-4
00:05:20.034 --> 00:05:23.937
<v Josh Sparkes>give you that audit trail because we're
collecting data from these requests.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1195-0
00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:28.748
<v Josh Sparkes>Which of course lets you identify
patterns. You guys are the reporting team,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1195-1
00:05:28.748 --> 00:05:32.314
<v Josh Sparkes>so you know that more more than well
assignments. So as I said,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1195-2
00:05:32.314 --> 00:05:35.992
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll start with manual assignment was
what we came to last time.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1195-3
00:05:35.992 --> 00:05:39.558
<v Josh Sparkes>So you have more control and later when
we have some more data,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1195-4
00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:43.737
<v Josh Sparkes>we can look at automation to see if that
can speed things up for you guys.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1246-0
00:05:43.817 --> 00:05:47.702
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's an overview,
but I've I've done a bit of a semi Visio</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1246-1
00:05:47.702 --> 00:05:51.951
<v Josh Sparkes>that may help some of you.
I've also done a more descriptive version.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1246-2
00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:56.928
<v Josh Sparkes>So what I'm suggesting here is that users
would first select what they want to do</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1246-3
00:05:56.928 --> 00:06:01.966
<v Josh Sparkes>for existing report requests at that top
branch there users an indicator that know</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1246-4
00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:02.937
<v Josh Sparkes>the report name.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1300-0
00:06:03.657 --> 00:06:06.167
<v Josh Sparkes>If yes,
then find it in a list and search it as</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1300-1
00:06:06.167 --> 00:06:09.044
<v Josh Sparkes>well. If no,
then they'd need to skip to describing it</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1300-2
00:06:09.044 --> 00:06:12.600
<v Josh Sparkes>for their need. Of course,
that's easier for the *** reporting team</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1300-3
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.418
<v Josh Sparkes>if they know the report and they were
able to state that in the request.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1300-4
00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:19.608
<v Josh Sparkes>If they don't know it,
then we'd have to understand from the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1300-5
00:06:19.608 --> 00:06:22.537
<v Josh Sparkes>description what it is and there's some
back and forth.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1322-0
00:06:23.177 --> 00:06:28.920
<v Josh Sparkes>But at least if we give them the option,
then it could save a lot of time in that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1322-1
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.417
<v Josh Sparkes>And on the other branch, Yep,
the new reports. Hey, Gordon. Yep.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1348-0
00:06:33.497 --> 00:06:37.180
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Sorry, Josh. Yeah,
I was just on the bit where they enter</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1348-1
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.800
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>the report name.
Is it possible to link that to our list</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1348-2
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.737
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>of scheduled reports,
almost like a search function for them?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1404-0
00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:49.933
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes. So it depends how you want to do it.
Probably like the the simplest way could</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1404-1
00:06:49.933 --> 00:06:54.307
<v Josh Sparkes>be managing a list within ServiceNow.
If we maintain a list within ServiceNow,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1374-0
00:06:52.737 --> 00:06:53.217
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1404-2
00:06:54.307 --> 00:06:58.737
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not sure if you're thinking of an
integration to an an external system, OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1448-0
00:06:54.537 --> 00:06:58.116
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah. So no, no, no.
It would be based on the the regular</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1448-1
00:06:58.116 --> 00:07:02.190
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>reports that we already do.
So they're going to be well and share</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1448-2
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.201
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>well their scheduled tickets,
you know they they are caught on a</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1415-0
00:07:06.017 --> 00:07:06.297
<v Josh Sparkes>Mm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1448-3
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:09.780
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>pre-arranged basis.
So if there was a way for the user to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1448-4
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.977
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>search those for the report looking for
that might be quite useful.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1466-0
00:07:14.937 --> 00:07:18.501
<v Josh Sparkes>As long as there's somewhere in service
now,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1466-1
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:22.937
<v Josh Sparkes>then yet we can reference a list of
reports that exist.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1452-0
00:07:19.097 --> 00:07:19.377
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1459-0
00:07:20.177 --> 00:07:22.417
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>OK, cool.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1494-0
00:07:22.057 --> 00:07:25.241
<v Parik Narain>We can,
we can take take this back Josh and then</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1494-1
00:07:25.241 --> 00:07:29.919
<v Parik Narain>let them be assessed the final set of
reports we are building etcetera.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1494-2
00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:34.337
<v Parik Narain>We will put that as a choice list on this
one is kind of picked up.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1487-0
00:07:32.377 --> 00:07:32.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1491-0
00:07:33.937 --> 00:07:34.177
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Cool.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1524-0
00:07:34.857 --> 00:07:38.200
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Yeah,
cool. OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1524-1
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:43.549
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just wondering if there's any other
requests that might not be in that list</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1524-2
00:07:43.549 --> 00:07:48.697
<v Josh Sparkes>that we might be needed that we could
concatenate on to the end of the list.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1545-0
00:07:49.377 --> 00:07:51.458
<v Josh Sparkes>Eric,
but that we can we can look it offline.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1545-1
00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:54.897
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's something that will come out
the back of the workshops anyway.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1592-0
00:07:53.497 --> 00:07:57.508
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, yeah, definitely. That's one. Yeah,
we can give both options, right?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1551-0
00:07:55.177 --> 00:07:57.697
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>They'll probably be quite a whole.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1592-1
00:07:57.508 --> 00:08:01.358
<v Parik Narain>We can have the list and if it's not
there, we can also ask for a name.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1564-0
00:08:01.137 --> 00:08:01.537
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1592-2
00:08:01.358 --> 00:08:04.834
<v Parik Narain>So we can if it's new one,
then you can always ask what you want</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1592-3
00:08:04.834 --> 00:08:08.096
<v Parik Narain>from it, et cetera.
So we can combine both and have a hybrid</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1575-0
00:08:05.497 --> 00:08:05.777
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1634-0
00:08:07.417 --> 00:08:10.327
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Yeah, maybe,
maybe some kind of free text option as</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1592-4
00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:08.417
<v Parik Narain>which.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1584-0
00:08:08.497 --> 00:08:08.737
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1634-1
00:08:10.327 --> 00:08:14.413
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>well. Within this organization,
there's probably thousands and thousands</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1599-0
00:08:12.497 --> 00:08:12.737
<v Parik Narain>Correct.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1634-2
00:08:14.413 --> 00:08:17.436
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>of report, you know,
just in different systems, free,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1618-0
00:08:16.977 --> 00:08:17.217
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1634-3
00:08:17.436 --> 00:08:20.458
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>you'll have reporting capabilities,
fusion, etcetera.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1634-4
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.697
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>So to try and capture them all would be.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1640-0
00:08:22.897 --> 00:08:25.457
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>An impossible task. Um, but yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1639-0
00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:24.177
<v Parik Narain>Right.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1635-0
00:08:24.457 --> 00:08:24.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Mm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1646-0
00:08:26.257 --> 00:08:26.377
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1650-0
00:08:26.697 --> 00:08:28.297
<v Parik Narain>Definitely, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1695-0
00:08:27.097 --> 00:08:30.126
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Gordian,
see for the see for the scheduled ones,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1657-0
00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:30.497
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1695-1
00:08:30.126 --> 00:08:35.381
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>is there there's like 300 odd isn't there?
Is that is that is that all in or is that</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1659-0
00:08:32.577 --> 00:08:32.817
<v Josh Sparkes>There.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1672-0
00:08:33.337 --> 00:08:35.217
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1670-0
00:08:34.697 --> 00:08:34.977
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1695-2
00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:40.079
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>would that be what would be available
within the search like if you were to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1695-3
00:08:40.079 --> 00:08:40.697
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>have that?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1734-0
00:08:40.697 --> 00:08:44.890
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>That that would be what I would imagine
what was available in the search.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1734-1
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.140
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>So they're the ones that we've already
got established as regular reports.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1713-0
00:08:48.337 --> 00:08:49.057
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1734-2
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.447
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>So if someone wants to change that one of
those reports or decommission it,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1734-3
00:08:53.447 --> 00:08:55.657
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>delete it, they could search that list.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1740-0
00:08:55.417 --> 00:08:58.097
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Cool. And Josh, sorry, go on.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1748-0
00:08:55.697 --> 00:08:59.006
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>I don't know.
It might make life easier for them.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1748-1
00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:01.057
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>It might not thinking out loud.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1779-0
00:09:00.697 --> 00:09:05.243
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Yeah. And Josh, do you know,
is there any like limit on how many can</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1779-1
00:09:05.243 --> 00:09:10.777
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>show in the search function of like would
300 odd be OK if we went down that route?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1802-0
00:09:09.417 --> 00:09:14.417
<v Parik Narain>No limit. Yeah, it's fine. No problem.
Hundreds is fine. Even thousands is fine,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1789-0
00:09:11.737 --> 00:09:14.097
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Yeah. OK. Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1791-0
00:09:13.777 --> 00:09:14.977
<v Mark Sedge>And and nothing.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1802-1
00:09:14.417 --> 00:09:16.577
<v Parik Narain>but thousands is hard to search on.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1800-0
00:09:16.057 --> 00:09:16.577
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1803-0
00:09:16.177 --> 00:09:17.937
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1865-0
00:09:16.417 --> 00:09:19.213
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
the the the other thing too with one of</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1865-1
00:09:19.213 --> 00:09:23.893
<v Mark Sedge>ServiceNow's capabilities is as they
start typing it would bring up close to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1865-2
00:09:23.893 --> 00:09:26.871
<v Mark Sedge>that item.
So they're not scrolling up and down,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1830-0
00:09:25.177 --> 00:09:25.857
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1865-3
00:09:26.871 --> 00:09:29.849
<v Mark Sedge>you know,
desperately trying to find the the the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1865-4
00:09:29.849 --> 00:09:32.949
<v Mark Sedge>said item.
And also if they're not sure if they've</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1853-0
00:09:32.657 --> 00:09:32.897
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1865-5
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:35.137
<v Mark Sedge>got a keyword they can use the star.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1879-0
00:09:35.577 --> 00:09:41.398
<v Mark Sedge>Wild card and put that in as well,
which also accelerates them to find their</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1879-1
00:09:41.398 --> 00:09:43.137
<v Mark Sedge>target, you know, item.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1877-0
00:09:43.497 --> 00:09:44.337
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1928-0
00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:50.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, move the sequel start. Yeah.
And I was debating over do we want to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1880-0
00:09:44.977 --> 00:09:45.137
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Sure.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1928-1
00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:56.857
<v Josh Sparkes>also put in a field for what department
or area or team is the report in but in</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1928-2
00:09:56.857 --> 00:09:59.017
<v Josh Sparkes>in the with the looking at.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1955-0
00:10:00.137 --> 00:10:04.646
<v Josh Sparkes>UX maybe we don't want to do that user
experience and I don't know if you guys</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1955-1
00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:08.984
<v Josh Sparkes>would value that data or would that data
just be available from the reports</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1955-2
00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:09.897
<v Josh Sparkes>metadata anyway?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1999-0
00:10:10.897 --> 00:10:13.635
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah,
I think what's probably more valuable is</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1961-0
00:10:11.057 --> 00:10:11.897
<v Taylor, Simon 14039>Come on.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1999-1
00:10:13.635 --> 00:10:17.596
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>the customer's department,
but that's probably going to be captured</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1979-0
00:10:17.577 --> 00:10:18.297
Yeah.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1999-2
00:10:17.596 --> 00:10:20.916
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>anyway, isn't it?
I imagine that would be a field in the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1982-0
00:10:19.337 --> 00:10:19.577
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2035-0
00:10:20.657 --> 00:10:25.310
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. OK, cool.
So that's that route. And then, yeah,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/1999-3
00:10:20.916 --> 00:10:22.897
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>customer table somewhere. So yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2035-1
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.830
<v Josh Sparkes>if they need a new report,
I think when you touched on it,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2035-2
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.946
<v Josh Sparkes>if they need a new report,
then they need to describe it to you guys</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2035-3
00:10:32.946 --> 00:10:37.719
<v Josh Sparkes>and we need to understand it a bit of a
bit more of a consulting style role and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2035-4
00:10:37.719 --> 00:10:38.017
<v Josh Sparkes>then.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2063-0
00:10:38.097 --> 00:10:42.692
<v Josh Sparkes>If they need help, of course,
that's also a the description.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2063-1
00:10:42.692 --> 00:10:46.307
<v Josh Sparkes>I've said that if it's a change,
delete or new,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2063-2
00:10:46.307 --> 00:10:50.977
<v Josh Sparkes>then we'd ask for justification.
Do you guys agree with that?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2071-0
00:10:52.577 --> 00:10:56.537
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2069-0
00:10:53.617 --> 00:10:56.057
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah, I think that makes sense, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2151-0
00:10:57.217 --> 00:10:59.441
<v Mark Sedge>I think one of one of the other things,
Josh,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2151-1
00:10:59.441 --> 00:11:03.502
<v Mark Sedge>just think about that one and again just
you may have it covered later or whatever.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2087-0
00:10:59.497 --> 00:10:59.657
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2151-2
00:11:03.502 --> 00:11:06.258
<v Mark Sedge>But another important thing would be to
ask the outcome.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2151-3
00:11:06.258 --> 00:11:10.223
<v Mark Sedge>I often ask the business what outcome are
they trying to get when I present these</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2151-4
00:11:10.223 --> 00:11:13.994
<v Mark Sedge>because ultimately they can say, well,
I want to do this because I want to do</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2151-5
00:11:13.994 --> 00:11:17.137
<v Mark Sedge>that and then yeah, yeah,
but what are actually because they're.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2175-0
00:11:17.217 --> 00:11:21.356
<v Mark Sedge>Your outcome might not match their ask.
And then you've got the benefit of saying,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2175-1
00:11:21.356 --> 00:11:25.145
<v Mark Sedge>well, if you're looking for that,
you actually need this report or you need</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2175-2
00:11:25.145 --> 00:11:27.439
<v Mark Sedge>to do something,
you know that can be a handy</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2175-3
00:11:27.439 --> 00:11:28.137
<v Mark Sedge>consideration.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2182-0
00:11:29.457 --> 00:11:32.158
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
sounds good to me if if everyone's on</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2182-1
00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:33.017
<v Josh Sparkes>board of that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2183-0
00:11:32.697 --> 00:11:33.017
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2216-0
00:11:33.537 --> 00:11:37.351
<v Parik Narain>Just just one more point.
Is there any approvals, George,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2189-0
00:11:35.297 --> 00:11:35.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2216-1
00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:41.297
<v Parik Narain>you think will be needed and then the
team especially with?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2225-0
00:11:38.257 --> 00:11:41.501
<v Josh Sparkes>Or I've I've got a checklist of things to
go through, Parikia.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2225-1
00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:43.457
<v Josh Sparkes>That is one of the things, but we can.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2229-0
00:11:42.377 --> 00:11:45.297
<v Parik Narain>OK, lovely. Great. I'm jumping to them.
Apologies.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2279-0
00:11:45.137 --> 00:11:48.828
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, no,
it's it's a good time to talk about it.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2279-1
00:11:48.828 --> 00:11:53.244
<v Josh Sparkes>We're looking at a workflow. So, so yeah,
why not approvals? Yeah,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2279-2
00:11:53.244 --> 00:11:56.803
<v Josh Sparkes>would would any of these need that?
I mean, you know,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2279-3
00:11:56.803 --> 00:12:01.417
<v Josh Sparkes>technically you could if we're selecting
a report name, we could say.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2305-0
00:12:02.257 --> 00:12:07.049
<v Josh Sparkes>If you select a specific report name,
then you could trigger an approval,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2305-1
00:12:07.049 --> 00:12:11.128
<v Josh Sparkes>but I don't want to go down that route.
Could we look at more?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2305-2
00:12:11.128 --> 00:12:15.337
<v Josh Sparkes>If we're deleting a report,
do we need a approval from somebody?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2310-0
00:12:16.857 --> 00:12:18.057
<v Josh Sparkes>For example.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2322-0
00:12:17.137 --> 00:12:20.457
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Yeah, yeah, it's it's something that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2319-0
00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:20.217
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2324-0
00:12:19.497 --> 00:12:21.977
<v Hall, Emma 14831>It would depend on the report, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2378-0
00:12:21.937 --> 00:12:26.473
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Yeah, we need to probably firm,
but the team manager a lot of this stuff</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2327-0
00:12:21.977 --> 00:12:22.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2378-1
00:12:26.473 --> 00:12:30.635
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>fairly informally at the moment,
the the kind of process in place,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2349-0
00:12:27.297 --> 00:12:27.657
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2378-2
00:12:30.635 --> 00:12:34.922
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>we probably could use the system to
mature in that area slightly and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2367-0
00:12:34.377 --> 00:12:34.977
<v Josh Sparkes>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2378-3
00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:37.097
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>particularly decommissions changes.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2407-0
00:12:37.297 --> 00:12:41.062
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Ideally we would be getting approval from
the report owner who got,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2390-0
00:12:40.817 --> 00:12:41.337
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2407-1
00:12:41.062 --> 00:12:44.938
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>and you can correct me if I'm wrong,
but usually listed on the report</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2388-0
00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:41.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2407-2
00:12:44.938 --> 00:12:47.097
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>catalogue who owns that report overall.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2418-0
00:12:45.377 --> 00:12:49.753
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's they'll be the sort of main,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2418-1
00:12:49.753 --> 00:12:52.777
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>main contact for the recipients, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2449-0
00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:57.479
<v Mark Sedge>Do you have any,
do you have any Gordon that's sensitive?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2449-1
00:12:57.479 --> 00:13:00.289
<v Mark Sedge>Uh,
you know which which might need approval</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2428-0
00:12:57.617 --> 00:12:59.097
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2449-2
00:13:00.289 --> 00:13:02.537
<v Mark Sedge>to say yes, it's OK to release that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2494-0
00:13:02.897 --> 00:13:06.022
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, we do.
And that's probably more based on the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2451-0
00:13:04.057 --> 00:13:04.697
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2494-1
00:13:06.022 --> 00:13:09.209
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>type of data that's been requested.
So for example,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2494-2
00:13:09.209 --> 00:13:13.866
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>salary data or personal identifiable
information that needs to be approved.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2494-3
00:13:13.866 --> 00:13:18.217
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Obviously we do have a pre-approval
process in place where we can use.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2482-0
00:13:15.577 --> 00:13:15.977
<v Mark Sedge>Yep.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2563-0
00:13:18.417 --> 00:13:22.302
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>The HR database to look up what people
are already allowed access to.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2489-0
00:13:18.697 --> 00:13:19.017
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2502-0
00:13:22.097 --> 00:13:22.377
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2563-1
00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:25.133
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Beyond that,
it needs to go to data privacy. Hema,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2563-2
00:13:25.133 --> 00:13:28.297
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>that's right, isn't it?
Data privacy will give us, yeah,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2534-0
00:13:26.897 --> 00:13:31.017
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Oh yeah, that's can compliant. Yeah. Data.
Data protection, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2563-3
00:13:28.297 --> 00:13:32.127
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>risk and compliance. Yeah,
they'll give us permission to release it.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2563-4
00:13:32.127 --> 00:13:35.735
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>If the person isn't already pre-approved,
that's their decision.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2563-5
00:13:35.735 --> 00:13:38.177
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>So that's maybe that as a sort of
separate.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2548-0
00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:37.697
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2565-0
00:13:38.257 --> 00:13:39.697
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Workflow if you like.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2614-0
00:13:38.657 --> 00:13:42.260
<v Mark Sedge>So, so it could be,
so it could be that in that we yeah where</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2614-1
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.619
<v Mark Sedge>we recognise those that we can auto
generate some of those reports to that</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2614-2
00:13:46.619 --> 00:13:51.269
<v Mark Sedge>team to say so that it's again uses the
automation and you have the audit trail</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2614-3
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:54.698
<v Mark Sedge>of that approval,
you'll be able to see that in the ticket</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2604-0
00:13:53.017 --> 00:13:53.497
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2614-4
00:13:54.698 --> 00:13:55.337
<v Mark Sedge>and things.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2615-0
00:13:55.697 --> 00:13:57.577
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, that would be good, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2616-0
00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:59.177
<v Hall, Emma 14831>That would be pretty good, yeah,
that'd be awesome.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2659-0
00:14:00.137 --> 00:14:03.192
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, yeah,
I will be publishing a a note of</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2659-1
00:14:03.192 --> 00:14:08.094
<v Josh Sparkes>everything that we discuss here and
actions out of this. By the way,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2659-2
00:14:08.094 --> 00:14:12.286
<v Josh Sparkes>that's why we're recording it. OK, cool.
That sounds good.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2659-3
00:14:12.286 --> 00:14:16.335
<v Josh Sparkes>Any other questions on workflow,
we can come back to it.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2659-4
00:14:16.335 --> 00:14:19.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Otherwise I'll speak around a couple of.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2673-0
00:14:19.537 --> 00:14:24.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Other less critical points if you will.
Otherwise I'll I'll move on.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2674-0
00:14:24.537 --> 00:14:26.137
<v Hall, Emma 14831>No, no questions.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2708-0
00:14:26.257 --> 00:14:28.961
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Can we maybe just one thing on the
workflow, Josh,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2681-0
00:14:26.977 --> 00:14:28.377
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2708-1
00:14:28.961 --> 00:14:31.348
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>that when someone's requesting a new
report,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2708-2
00:14:31.348 --> 00:14:35.537
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>could we have one date field in there and
just ask them when it's required by?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2716-0
00:14:36.737 --> 00:14:39.657

00:14:37.697 --> 00:14:42.262
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Because that's quite often something that
they miss out in their e-mail when they</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2739-1
00:14:42.262 --> 00:14:45.937
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>need it and then they'll chase it because
they haven't got it so.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2795-0

00:14:59.217 --> 00:14:59.577
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>No.</v>

00:15:01.121 --> 00:15:04.017
<v Mark Sedge>say you could actually sort of get them
to guide.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2845-0
00:15:04.257 --> 00:15:04.617
<v Mark Sedge>Little.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2855-0
00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:07.542
<v Mark Sedge>A little bit more about what they're

what are the sorts of things that you</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2855-2
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.677

what? How do they want it?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2855-3
00:15:14.677 --> 00:15:18.417
<v Mark Sedge>Do they want it presented in a graph?
Do they want it presented in a table?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2855-4
00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:20.926
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
some of these things are things that you</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2837-0
00:15:20.497 --> 00:15:21.097
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2855-5
00:15:20.926 --> 00:15:23.977
<v Mark Sedge>can you you can put,
even if it's just a tick list, you know.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2859-0
00:15:24.417 --> 00:15:27.256
<v Mark Sedge>I want, you know,
a table form and a graph form or</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2859-1
00:15:27.256 --> 00:15:29.817
<v Mark Sedge>something. Yeah,
those things that you would.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2878-0
00:15:31.257 --> 00:15:34.300
<v Mark Sedge>Want the, you know,

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2878-1
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.016
<v Mark Sedge>initial.
It just accelerates your ability to plan</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2924-0
00:15:36.657 --> 00:15:40.671
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, I think, well,
it's something we don't get at the moment,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2878-2
00:15:37.016 --> 00:15:37.777
<v Mark Sedge>for it, right?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2924-1
00:15:40.671 --> 00:15:45.625
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Mark, because they do it by e-mail,
but I think a lot of that would be useful.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2900-0
00:15:42.017 --> 00:15:42.457
<v Mark Sedge>It's, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2924-2
00:15:45.625 --> 00:15:50.454
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>I think as a as an absolute bare minimum
would be the date that is required,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2924-3
00:15:50.454 --> 00:15:51.897
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>who the recipients are.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2926-0
00:15:52.657 --> 00:15:53.537
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>And.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2957-0
00:15:55.217 --> 00:15:58.930
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>You know whether it's a what frequency
it's on, if it's in your regular report,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2957-1
00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.457
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>those would be the three bare minimum
things that we would request I think.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3011-0
00:16:00.497 --> 00:16:03.313
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.
So we could do some of those as mandatory.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2954-0
00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:03.097
<v Josh Sparkes>Mm-hmm. Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3011-1
00:16:03.313 --> 00:16:06.647
<v Mark Sedge>And so I think,
sorry Josh and forgive me sort of jumping</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2960-0
00:16:04.017 --> 00:16:04.377
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3011-2
00:16:06.647 --> 00:16:10.958
<v Mark Sedge>in here, but hopefully it's helpful.
What you what you might want to do is</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3011-3
00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.487
<v Mark Sedge>just take a little outside of this
session,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3011-4
00:16:13.487 --> 00:16:17.913
<v Mark Sedge>have a little think about the things if
you know instead of it coming in the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3011-5
00:16:17.913 --> 00:16:20.097
<v Mark Sedge>e-mail, splodge your words, what sort?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/2999-0
00:16:19.777 --> 00:16:20.297
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3069-0
00:16:20.617 --> 00:16:24.912
<v Mark Sedge>What sorts of things would you ask and
what would you want to have for sure?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3010-0
00:16:23.777 --> 00:16:23.897
<v Hall, Emma 14831>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3069-1
00:16:24.912 --> 00:16:29.597
<v Mark Sedge>Structure those as a as a simple list and
then what we can do is take that away and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3069-2
00:16:29.597 --> 00:16:32.218
<v Mark Sedge>fold that in.
So when they select that option,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3069-3
00:16:32.218 --> 00:16:35.788
<v Mark Sedge>they're presented with those fields of
which they can populate,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3069-4
00:16:35.788 --> 00:16:40.417
<v Mark Sedge>which enables you to have a better run at
it when it lands in your laps to action.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3057-0
00:16:39.417 --> 00:16:39.657
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3071-0
00:16:40.897 --> 00:16:44.057
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Cool. Yeah, we can do that. Um, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3070-0
00:16:40.937 --> 00:16:41.057
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3072-0
00:16:42.657 --> 00:16:44.257
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah, we can work on that, Gordon.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3081-0
00:16:44.777 --> 00:16:47.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Right. All right.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3090-0
00:16:45.462 --> 00:16:50.262
Sorry for when is this due by.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3098-0
00:16:50.662 --> 00:16:52.062
I know you're kind of expecting a date.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3102-0
00:16:52.062 --> 00:16:54.102
Is it the only reason?

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3123-0
00:16:54.142 --> 00:16:58.331
I'm kind of questioning it is because if
you get so many requests in I see a date,

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3123-1
00:16:58.331 --> 00:17:00.702
they'll just go well up for today or
tomorrow.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3147-0
00:17:01.552 --> 00:17:02.152
The right, you know.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3148-0
00:17:02.152 --> 00:17:02.232
Is.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3131-0
00:17:02.217 --> 00:17:02.377
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3149-0
00:17:02.232 --> 00:17:04.643
There a.
Is there something that helps you to

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3149-1
00:17:04.643 --> 00:17:08.312
differentiate that you know? OK,
it might be for month end reporting.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3159-0
00:17:08.312 --> 00:17:11.592
It might be for leadership meeting that's
coming up.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3168-0
00:17:11.632 --> 00:17:14.412
It might be for you know.
Is there something that kind of is

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3168-1
00:17:14.412 --> 00:17:15.232
indicative to the?

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3172-0
00:17:15.582 --> 00:17:16.302
Oh, actually, no.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3199-0
00:17:16.302 --> 00:17:18.902
That is a high price,
one that helps us to prioritize it,

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3199-1
00:17:18.902 --> 00:17:22.354
because if we can cut some of it just
becomes a little bit easier for you in

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3184-0
00:17:19.457 --> 00:17:19.977
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>It's.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3199-2
00:17:22.354 --> 00:17:24.102
the team rather than just getting that.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3219-0
00:17:23.457 --> 00:17:27.713
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, I don't.
I don't think we're particularly good at</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3204-0
00:17:24.102 --> 00:17:24.742
I need it by tomorrow.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3219-1
00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:31.817
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>prioritization and I think the reason for
that is it.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3282-0
00:17:32.657 --> 00:17:36.277
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>What would be a high priority is
something that would be critical to the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3282-1
00:17:36.277 --> 00:17:38.806
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>business,
but the reporting team won't necessarily</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3282-2
00:17:38.806 --> 00:17:41.186
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>know what's critical to the business.
You know,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3282-3
00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:44.508
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>we we basically if it comes from a
C-suite employee or a director,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3282-4
00:17:44.508 --> 00:17:47.830
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>we're going to do it straight away.
If it comes from someone else,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3282-5
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.657
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>then you know that's kind of how it works
at the moment.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3296-0
00:17:50.777 --> 00:17:54.581
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>So yeah, I mean,
I appreciate they probably will just put</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3277-0
00:17:52.417 --> 00:17:52.617
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3296-1
00:17:54.581 --> 00:17:58.057
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>in the earliest date they can if we ask
them for it.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3318-0
00:17:59.377 --> 00:18:03.134
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>That's baby up to us to then manage our
customers a bit better and say, OK,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3318-1
00:18:03.134 --> 00:18:05.457
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>you've requested this for today,
but you know.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3366-0
00:18:04.457 --> 00:18:08.594
<v Mark Sedge>Well, so, so again Gordon,
some of the things you can do is you if</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3366-1
00:18:08.594 --> 00:18:12.114
<v Mark Sedge>if you know that your typical turn around
is say 3 days,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3366-2
00:18:12.114 --> 00:18:17.115
<v Mark Sedge>what you can do is when they select when
it's due, if we give them a date thing,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3366-3
00:18:17.115 --> 00:18:20.697
<v Mark Sedge>it will grey out and they'll only ever be
able to select.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3426-0
00:18:21.137 --> 00:18:25.516
<v Mark Sedge>Giving you enough time, right.
So there there's some smart things to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3371-0
00:18:23.857 --> 00:18:23.977
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3426-1
00:18:25.516 --> 00:18:29.451
<v Mark Sedge>sort of consider in the broader design
that you can go, well,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3426-2
00:18:29.451 --> 00:18:32.560
<v Mark Sedge>actually if if they they can't have it
tomorrow,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3426-3
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.764
<v Mark Sedge>if you know you need 48 hours or 36 hours.
So ultimately you present that so they</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3404-0
00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:33.817
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3410-0
00:18:35.377 --> 00:18:35.937
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3426-4
00:18:37.764 --> 00:18:39.097
<v Mark Sedge>can only ever select.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3479-0
00:18:39.457 --> 00:18:43.358
<v Mark Sedge>It with enough lead time for you to
action might be something.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3434-0
00:18:42.457 --> 00:18:43.177
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3479-1
00:18:43.358 --> 00:18:48.312
<v Mark Sedge>And then what you could do is you could
have an open field to say you know when</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3479-2
00:18:48.312 --> 00:18:51.595
<v Mark Sedge>when I sort of talked about the outcome
or whatever,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3479-3
00:18:51.595 --> 00:18:56.673
<v Mark Sedge>you could say you know preferred date or
target date or you know what I mean just</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3479-4
00:18:56.673 --> 00:18:58.097
<v Mark Sedge>as an indicative field.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3475-0
00:18:57.737 --> 00:18:58.457
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3538-0
00:18:58.217 --> 00:19:02.691
<v Mark Sedge>So that you've won when you're setting
the expectations say there's a lead time</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3480-0
00:18:59.657 --> 00:18:59.817
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3538-1
00:19:02.691 --> 00:19:07.165
<v Mark Sedge>and the second level then says so that
you can see when they because they might</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3538-2
00:19:07.165 --> 00:19:11.584
<v Mark Sedge>they might you know say well I want it
for the end of the week and it's Monday</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3510-0
00:19:10.217 --> 00:19:10.457
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3518-0
00:19:11.457 --> 00:19:11.817
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3538-3
00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:16.058
<v Mark Sedge>and then somebody else might say I want
it you know for Thursday or and then it</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3538-4
00:19:16.058 --> 00:19:16.897
<v Mark Sedge>that helps you.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3580-0
00:19:16.977 --> 00:19:21.549
<v Mark Sedge>Although it's not perfect,
it's an indicative view and then you can</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3580-1
00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:24.575
<v Mark Sedge>build upon it as you get used to the
system.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3580-2
00:19:24.575 --> 00:19:28.609
<v Mark Sedge>You might be able to then start refining
what you you know,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3580-3
00:19:28.609 --> 00:19:31.097
<v Mark Sedge>how you draw out that prioritisation.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3581-0
00:19:31.297 --> 00:19:34.051
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, no,
that that would actually be quite good.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3581-1
00:19:34.051 --> 00:19:35.097
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>I like sounding up.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3605-0
00:19:36.817 --> 00:19:41.600
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep, I just to be, yeah,
careful about wording on it when we say</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3587-0
00:19:37.697 --> 00:19:38.137
<v Mark Sedge>I'm glad.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3605-1
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.617
<v Josh Sparkes>so they don't think it's a promised date.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3603-0
00:19:43.137 --> 00:19:44.537
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3607-0
00:19:46.177 --> 00:19:46.417
<v Josh Sparkes>And.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3627-0
00:19:46.657 --> 00:19:49.698
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>OK. Well, again,
Emma and I could probably catch up on</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3613-0
00:19:47.377 --> 00:19:47.657
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3654-0
00:19:48.337 --> 00:19:53.378
<v Mark Sedge>I think, Josh, that's why I was using it.
That's why I was using indicative as a,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3627-1
00:19:49.698 --> 00:19:50.417
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>that as well.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3633-0
00:19:52.497 --> 00:19:52.777
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3639-0
00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:54.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3654-1
00:19:53.378 --> 00:19:56.083
<v Mark Sedge>you know,
or target or something like that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3654-2
00:19:56.083 --> 00:19:59.833
<v Mark Sedge>So it's not locked,
but it helps you see what you need to do</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3654-3
00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:00.017
<v Mark Sedge>by.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3659-0
00:20:02.497 --> 00:20:04.657
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Any other thoughts, Gordon,
while we're here?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3676-0
00:20:05.617 --> 00:20:09.152
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>No, I think we're good there.
I think Emma and I can add that to us to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3676-1
00:20:09.152 --> 00:20:10.497
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>things we'll talk about so.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3677-0
00:20:10.337 --> 00:20:11.897
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Absolutely, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3711-0
00:20:12.097 --> 00:20:18.097
<v Josh Sparkes>All right, great. What else do we have?
So for those where where the report name</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3711-1
00:20:18.097 --> 00:20:21.875
<v Josh Sparkes>is provided,
I guess stuff probably seems obvious,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3711-2
00:20:21.875 --> 00:20:25.578
<v Josh Sparkes>but you know,
be able to verify easier processing</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3711-3
00:20:25.578 --> 00:20:26.097
<v Josh Sparkes>faster.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3768-0
00:20:26.137 --> 00:20:29.173
<v Josh Sparkes>Faster etc.
So that's kind of the benefits of of</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3768-1
00:20:29.173 --> 00:20:34.317
<v Josh Sparkes>having the name where the users will will
use that function or if they'll just try</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3768-2
00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:37.539
<v Josh Sparkes>to skip it.
I mean we we can try and get them to do</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3768-3
00:20:37.539 --> 00:20:40.699
<v Josh Sparkes>that with some some good labeling and and
wording,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3768-4
00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:45.657
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's definitely beneficial whereas
yeah as I said if they if they're fully.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3808-0
00:20:46.497 --> 00:20:50.695
<v Josh Sparkes>So the description route then is a put a
bit more back and forth,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3808-1
00:20:50.695 --> 00:20:54.956
<v Josh Sparkes>but you do have that kind of chat
functionality within ServiceNow,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3808-2
00:20:54.956 --> 00:20:59.217
<v Josh Sparkes>so it's like a comments back and forth.
So keep saying that, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3840-0
00:20:55.737 --> 00:20:58.913
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, that's, yeah. Again,
that'll be a big benefit.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3799-0
00:20:56.857 --> 00:20:58.497
No good.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3840-1
00:20:58.913 --> 00:21:03.766
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>I think what happens at the moment is the
customer will find out who the tickets</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3840-2
00:21:03.766 --> 00:21:07.601
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>are sent to and then message them in
teams and then there's no,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3828-0
00:21:06.657 --> 00:21:06.897
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3840-3
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:11.017
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>there's no audit trail then it's not,
it's not. So yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3832-0
00:21:08.537 --> 00:21:08.737
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3879-0
00:21:10.017 --> 00:21:13.975
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I can.
I can share how that looks as well and if</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3879-1
00:21:13.975 --> 00:21:17.429
<v Josh Sparkes>that will help help visualize it.
And yeah, OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3879-2
00:21:17.429 --> 00:21:22.971
<v Josh Sparkes>So I kind of mentioned earlier about
having the where we manage that list of</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3879-3
00:21:22.971 --> 00:21:27.217
<v Josh Sparkes>reports from. So I guess,
I guess before the call I would.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3928-0
00:21:28.097 --> 00:21:32.867
<v Josh Sparkes>Thought we could have that table of
reports in in ServiceNow with their</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3928-1
00:21:32.867 --> 00:21:36.312
<v Josh Sparkes>metadata and I think this was this was
Mark's idea.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3928-2
00:21:36.312 --> 00:21:41.547
<v Josh Sparkes>But if if there's a new like a request
for a new report or to delete a report,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3928-3
00:21:41.547 --> 00:21:46.847
<v Josh Sparkes>then at the end of that request we can
add a task in just to remind the team we</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3928-4
00:21:46.847 --> 00:21:47.377
<v Josh Sparkes>need to.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3965-0
00:21:47.737 --> 00:21:52.711
<v Josh Sparkes>Edit that that managed list of reports so
that it's an up-to-date list.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3965-1
00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:57.755
<v Josh Sparkes>But what we saying earlier, sorry,
so the for the list of reports we are</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3965-2
00:21:57.755 --> 00:22:02.937
<v Josh Sparkes>saying that we want to get that from
within ServiceNow. I think Parik you.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3967-0
00:22:03.097 --> 00:22:05.097
<v Josh Sparkes>He will speak into that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3975-0
00:22:05.977 --> 00:22:09.097
<v Josh Sparkes>All that all that would be within service
now the list of reports.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3978-0
00:22:10.497 --> 00:22:10.737
<v Parik Narain>Correct.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/3979-0
00:22:11.417 --> 00:22:12.657
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, OK, cool.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4024-0
00:22:13.657 --> 00:22:16.327
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So that's just kind of a note as to what</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4024-1
00:22:16.327 --> 00:22:20.646
<v Josh Sparkes>we can do to make sure that that all
flows together and just check with the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4024-2
00:22:20.646 --> 00:22:23.827
<v Josh Sparkes>things I wanted to make sure we came out
of here weird.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4024-3
00:22:23.827 --> 00:22:27.634
<v Josh Sparkes>So who can make the request?
Is it open to everybody to be able to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4024-4
00:22:27.634 --> 00:22:28.657
<v Josh Sparkes>make this request?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4019-0
00:22:29.457 --> 00:22:29.617
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4022-0
00:22:29.577 --> 00:22:30.537
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4059-0
00:22:30.057 --> 00:22:33.688
<v Josh Sparkes>Cool, cool, cool.
You guys own in form design.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4059-1
00:22:33.688 --> 00:22:39.559
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll take all those bits on board.
If you guys are able to to share with me</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4059-2
00:22:39.559 --> 00:22:44.657
<v Josh Sparkes>what would be useful in the new form
request, I can include that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4050-0
00:22:41.097 --> 00:22:41.377
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4086-0
00:22:45.257 --> 00:22:49.792
<v Josh Sparkes>So, yeah, that makes sense.
We'll kind of go if we're happy to go</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4086-1
00:22:49.792 --> 00:22:53.846
<v Josh Sparkes>ahead with this preliminary workflow,
get those fields in.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4086-2
00:22:53.846 --> 00:22:56.457
<v Josh Sparkes>That can conclude that one. Hey, Jill.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4147-0
00:22:58.217 --> 00:23:02.828
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I'm just thinking out loud here. Sorry,
just take me a wee minute to work through</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4147-1
00:23:02.828 --> 00:23:06.932
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>that workflow piece and what reports
we're talking about here. But Emma,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4147-2
00:23:06.932 --> 00:23:10.587
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Gordon, have you get any?
I know you've got live checks on SOPs.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4147-3
00:23:10.587 --> 00:23:13.624
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Do they sit under this process?
Is it somewhere else?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4147-4
00:23:13.624 --> 00:23:17.897
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>If you get any other kind of live checks
or peer checks that you do within?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4153-0
00:23:17.897 --> 00:23:21.497
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>the teams on any of these ones that need
to be included in the workflow.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4197-0
00:23:22.057 --> 00:23:28.060
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Definitely. It does. Yeah,
the checks aren't recorded anywhere at</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4175-0
00:23:22.137 --> 00:23:26.417
<v Hall, Emma 14831>That just kind of sits separate,
I would say, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4197-1
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:34.700
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>the moment. They sit separately.
So the SOPS are obviously a peer check.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4197-2
00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.337
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>What's the others?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4252-0
00:23:35.657 --> 00:23:38.837
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>That's fine.
I think we've got an opportunity to start</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4200-0
00:23:37.697 --> 00:23:37.817
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4252-1
00:23:38.837 --> 00:23:42.769
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>capturing them in the system.
We can use an approval workflow to do</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4213-0
00:23:39.817 --> 00:23:42.017
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, definitely. Mm-hmm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4211-0
00:23:39.897 --> 00:23:40.817
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Alright, OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4252-2
00:23:42.769 --> 00:23:45.949
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>that and can embed the checklist within
that workflow.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4252-3
00:23:45.949 --> 00:23:49.534
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So just maybe not for this workflow,
but whichever one it is,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4230-0
00:23:46.977 --> 00:23:47.137
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4233-0
00:23:47.097 --> 00:23:48.017
<v Hall, Emma 14831>That'll be good.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4252-4
00:23:49.534 --> 00:23:53.177
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>just keep that in mind so that we
consider that kind of stuff.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4313-0
00:23:54.057 --> 00:23:57.738
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>A good shout Joe.
The other point just around that overall</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4248-0
00:23:54.217 --> 00:23:54.417
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4313-1
00:23:57.738 --> 00:24:02.792
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>workflow is there is probably an end to
end piece here with the data engineering</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4261-0
00:23:58.337 --> 00:23:58.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Um.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4313-2
00:24:02.792 --> 00:24:06.722
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>team that sit within IT and particularly
for any new requests.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4313-3
00:24:06.722 --> 00:24:11.589
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>If there isn't for instance a data model
available or we don't have access to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4313-4
00:24:11.589 --> 00:24:13.897
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>particular data sets, there would be.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4356-0
00:24:13.897 --> 00:24:18.233
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Instances we would have to we'd like to
triage into the data engineering team to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4356-1
00:24:18.233 --> 00:24:22.570
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>make that data available for us reporting
to report on and a lot of that happens</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4356-2
00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:26.960
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>off system right now and can feel like a
bit of a black hole when we don't really</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4408-0
00:24:25.657 --> 00:24:29.400
<v Mark Sedge>We can, yeah, we, yeah,
totally we we can absolutely do it.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4356-3
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.977
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>get visibility but.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4408-1
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.518
<v Mark Sedge>So what the team can do,
what we'll think about when we structure</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4408-2
00:24:33.518 --> 00:24:38.384
<v Mark Sedge>the flow will be once they get it in,
they can either initiate a task or they</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4408-3
00:24:38.384 --> 00:24:41.566
<v Mark Sedge>can say yes,
I need some data engineering support.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4408-4
00:24:41.566 --> 00:24:45.497
<v Mark Sedge>They can, you know,
it'll either pull out some of the content.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4470-0
00:24:45.697 --> 00:24:49.679
<v Mark Sedge>From the existing record,
save them having to type it and then they</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4470-1
00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:54.597
<v Mark Sedge>just put an instruction in what they want
the data engineering team to do for them.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4470-2
00:24:54.597 --> 00:24:59.106
<v Mark Sedge>You know that is that is achievable
because I said I assume currently do you</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4470-3
00:24:59.106 --> 00:25:03.966
<v Mark Sedge>go into chair one and raise a ticket for
them to do that data engineering or is it</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4470-4
00:25:03.966 --> 00:25:05.137
<v Mark Sedge>just send an e-mail?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4455-0
00:25:04.817 --> 00:25:05.057
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>It.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4474-0
00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:07.377
<v Mark Sedge>To someone in the group and say can you
help us?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4521-0
00:25:07.257 --> 00:25:11.004
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>I think it goes into Cherwell,
but we use e-mail as we emailed the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4480-0
00:25:10.577 --> 00:25:10.897
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4521-1
00:25:11.004 --> 00:25:14.807
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>engineering team e-mail address and that
creates a Cherwell ticket.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4494-0
00:25:13.217 --> 00:25:13.457
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4521-2
00:25:14.807 --> 00:25:17.436
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>But as Wayne says there's no visibility
on it,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4521-3
00:25:17.436 --> 00:25:19.897
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>it disappears in a black hole and you
know.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4577-0
00:25:17.697 --> 00:25:21.579
<v Mark Sedge>Well, exactly. And the benefit,
and This is why I'm saying have it as an</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4577-1
00:25:21.579 --> 00:25:25.035
<v Mark Sedge>as amalgamated task, right,
associated with the record is you'll</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4577-2
00:25:25.035 --> 00:25:29.024
<v Mark Sedge>always be able to see where it is.
You'll see whether that person's put it</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4542-0
00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:26.897
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4577-3
00:25:29.024 --> 00:25:32.267
<v Mark Sedge>as work in progress,
whether they've got done any work notes</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4577-4
00:25:32.267 --> 00:25:35.511
<v Mark Sedge>in it, for example.
Now we'll have a look at what that looks</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4577-5
00:25:35.511 --> 00:25:35.777
<v Mark Sedge>like.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4610-0
00:25:36.217 --> 00:25:40.454
<v Mark Sedge>But what we'll do is when we get to that
position, we will, you know,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4610-1
00:25:40.454 --> 00:25:44.450
<v Mark Sedge>we'll engage with the community,
the IT team, because ultimately,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4610-2
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:47.537
<v Mark Sedge>who's is that Caroline's organization
they sit in?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4614-0
00:25:47.657 --> 00:25:48.817
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, it will be.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4673-0
00:25:48.297 --> 00:25:50.656
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah. So we one of the products,
yeah. So,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4673-1
00:25:50.656 --> 00:25:53.303
<v Mark Sedge>So what we would do is we'll align and
then, you know,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4673-2
00:25:53.303 --> 00:25:57.299
<v Mark Sedge>because they're going to be on board with
their own instant problem change and all</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4673-3
00:25:57.299 --> 00:26:00.476
<v Mark Sedge>of that lovely good stuff,
we'll just assign it straight to their</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4673-4
00:26:00.476 --> 00:26:02.834
<v Mark Sedge>queue.
They'll be able to pick it up just as any</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4673-5
00:26:02.834 --> 00:26:06.397
<v Mark Sedge>other task as long as we've got the
content that enables them to take the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4673-6
00:26:06.397 --> 00:26:07.937
<v Mark Sedge>actions that you're looking for.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4686-0
00:26:08.137 --> 00:26:12.649
<v Mark Sedge>For you're then again through the notes,
you'll be able to track, interact,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4686-1
00:26:12.649 --> 00:26:15.617
<v Mark Sedge>you know, follow that through to fruition,
right?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4691-0
00:26:17.817 --> 00:26:18.817
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, sounds good.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4747-0
00:26:18.297 --> 00:26:21.201
<v Mark Sedge>I think Josh,
that's a that's a absolute certainty to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4747-1
00:26:21.201 --> 00:26:25.127
<v Mark Sedge>do that because we talk about the
interoperability a lot across anywhere</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4715-0
00:26:24.737 --> 00:26:25.217
<v Josh Sparkes>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4747-2
00:26:25.127 --> 00:26:27.869
<v Mark Sedge>where there's something going into an
established,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4747-3
00:26:27.869 --> 00:26:31.741
<v Mark Sedge>especially the like the IT squad,
we need to be driving it through as a</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4747-4
00:26:31.741 --> 00:26:32.817
<v Mark Sedge>task auto generated.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4794-0
00:26:33.417 --> 00:26:38.358
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>And I'm assuming you don't need fences
support. Sorry, not fences. What?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4742-0
00:26:33.537 --> 00:26:34.417
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>That would be.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4794-1
00:26:38.358 --> 00:26:41.877
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>The engineering?
Is that what you call them? Sorry,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4759-0
00:26:39.617 --> 00:26:40.977
<v Hall, Emma 14831>The engine.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4794-2
00:26:41.877 --> 00:26:47.021
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I guess you don't need their support on
every single request that comes in.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4779-0
00:26:46.977 --> 00:26:48.337
<v Hall, Emma 14831>No. Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4794-3
00:26:47.021 --> 00:26:50.337
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>It's only certain ones. Yeah,
so it's maybe not.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4789-0
00:26:48.457 --> 00:26:51.057
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, I to be, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4781-0
00:26:48.537 --> 00:26:48.737
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4786-0
00:26:49.817 --> 00:26:50.697
<v Josh Sparkes>I need that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4811-0
00:26:50.617 --> 00:26:54.978
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Automatic in the workflow is just having
the option to be able to create that</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4858-0
00:26:52.537 --> 00:26:55.951
<v Mark Sedge>It will be a tick.
What what we're set up Jill is something</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4805-0
00:26:53.577 --> 00:26:54.177
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4811-1
00:26:54.978 --> 00:26:55.817
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>workflow, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4858-1
00:26:55.951 --> 00:27:00.276
<v Mark Sedge>like where they go data engineering
required for example when they assessed</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4858-2
00:27:00.276 --> 00:27:04.829
<v Mark Sedge>it and they can do a tick save and what
it will do is it will generate the task</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4838-0
00:27:01.177 --> 00:27:04.057
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah. And then that kicks off.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4858-3
00:27:04.829 --> 00:27:09.097
<v Mark Sedge>and then they can or or what it will do
is we'll have it so that they can.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4845-0
00:27:05.177 --> 00:27:05.937
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Perfect.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4921-0
00:27:09.177 --> 00:27:11.834
<v Mark Sedge>You know, they've got the option to say,
you know,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4921-1
00:27:11.834 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Mark Sedge>create a task on the bottom of that
record and assign it specifically to,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4921-2
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.599
<v Mark Sedge>you know, to that. There's there's more,
there's lots of ways of doing it.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4921-3
00:27:19.599 --> 00:27:23.767
<v Mark Sedge>If it's if it's an absolute against a
given type of report that you know you're</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4921-4
00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:26.998
<v Mark Sedge>always going to need,
then we can make that an auto one based</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4921-5
00:27:26.998 --> 00:27:28.457
<v Mark Sedge>upon the name of the report.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4943-0
00:27:28.697 --> 00:27:32.002
<v Mark Sedge>Or the type of the report.
Or what we can do, as I say,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4911-0
00:27:28.737 --> 00:27:28.977
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4943-1
00:27:32.002 --> 00:27:36.193
<v Mark Sedge>is do it so the team can manually
initiate a task that's linked to the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4943-2
00:27:36.193 --> 00:27:38.377
<v Mark Sedge>record and goes off and takes action.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4941-0
00:27:38.577 --> 00:27:40.057
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Oh, thank you.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4968-0
00:27:39.177 --> 00:27:42.914
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Great. That would be a a huge,
huge win for us just in terms of trying</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4955-0
00:27:41.817 --> 00:27:42.337
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4968-1
00:27:42.914 --> 00:27:46.177
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>to sort that operating model.
That'd be a huge benefit, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4958-0
00:27:42.937 --> 00:27:43.217
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Hmm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4957-0
00:27:42.977 --> 00:27:43.457
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4967-0
00:27:46.377 --> 00:27:46.577
<v Mark Sedge>No.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/4966-0
00:27:46.417 --> 00:27:46.577
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5005-0
00:27:47.017 --> 00:27:51.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Great. OK, cool. And I guess in that,
in that line of thinking,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5005-1
00:27:51.937 --> 00:27:57.164
<v Josh Sparkes>are there any other bits like that in the
workflow, Gordon or Remy,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5005-2
00:27:57.164 --> 00:28:01.777
<v Josh Sparkes>you can think of that we could cover any
other intricacies?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5037-0
00:28:02.937 --> 00:28:08.498
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>There's probably one or two with other
ask teams that we work really closely</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5037-1
00:28:08.498 --> 00:28:14.421
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>with particularly ask client. You know,
I think some of the some of the jobs that</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5025-0
00:28:13.297 --> 00:28:13.537
<v Mark Sedge>Yep.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5037-2
00:28:14.421 --> 00:28:18.177
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>ask client do require data from the
reporting team.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5070-0
00:28:18.537 --> 00:28:21.880
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>And you know,
so we have sort of way of working</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5070-1
00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:27.174
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>together at the moment where we just fire
emails to each other's sharewell,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5136-0
00:28:26.657 --> 00:28:31.097
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So, so Gordon, do you, do you,
would you be able to have a little look</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5070-2
00:28:27.174 --> 00:28:28.497
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>which is not great.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5067-0
00:28:28.017 --> 00:28:28.257
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5136-1
00:28:31.097 --> 00:28:34.384
<v Mark Sedge>at the list of those activities and do
the ins and outs.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5136-2
00:28:34.384 --> 00:28:36.979
<v Mark Sedge>So whether I call it the gives and the
gets.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5111-0
00:28:35.497 --> 00:28:40.057
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Mhm. Yeah, we can. Yeah. Yep.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5136-3
00:28:36.979 --> 00:28:41.535
<v Mark Sedge>So when you when you're giving something
out and you need you know for someone</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5136-4
00:28:41.535 --> 00:28:44.937
<v Mark Sedge>else who's asked of you and then when
you're getting from.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5120-0
00:28:42.612 --> 00:28:42.772
Cool.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5174-0
00:28:46.297 --> 00:28:50.634
<v Mark Sedge>The IT will be obviously a get,
it might be worth just running down what</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5174-1
00:28:50.634 --> 00:28:55.505
<v Mark Sedge>are the and then because we can join up,
we've already had some of those sessions</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5174-2
00:28:55.505 --> 00:28:59.485
<v Mark Sedge>with that team, you know,
so we would it will enable us to join up</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5174-3
00:28:59.485 --> 00:29:02.337
<v Mark Sedge>some of those flows and then it will
literally.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5198-0
00:29:02.537 --> 00:29:05.584
<v Mark Sedge>Be a, you know,
nice little flow in and out.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5198-1
00:29:05.584 --> 00:29:09.038
<v Mark Sedge>Sweet handshakes.
Everybody knows what's going on.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5198-2
00:29:09.038 --> 00:29:10.257
<v Mark Sedge>Everybody can sit.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5190-0
00:29:09.177 --> 00:29:09.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5196-0
00:29:09.257 --> 00:29:11.137
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, go.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5248-0
00:29:10.777 --> 00:29:14.361
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So I think we still need to do the
reporting session with client.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5248-1
00:29:14.361 --> 00:29:17.455
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>We can run out of time on their day for
their workshops,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5248-2
00:29:17.455 --> 00:29:20.659
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>but that's something we'll ask them to do
as well, Gordon.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5248-3
00:29:20.659 --> 00:29:24.297
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So we'll see it from both sides and we'll
be able to line them up.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5229-0
00:29:21.257 --> 00:29:22.337
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5240-0
00:29:23.657 --> 00:29:25.017
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, cool.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5253-0
00:29:24.937 --> 00:29:28.329
<v Mark Sedge>And if it doesn't join up,
we're in trouble.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5251-0
00:29:26.457 --> 00:29:27.857
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5253-1
00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:30.817
<v Mark Sedge>Is that what you're saying, Jill?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5252-0
00:29:28.657 --> 00:29:29.537
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Well, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5298-0
00:29:31.897 --> 00:29:35.396
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. And and generally Gordon,
those those was it four things.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5298-1
00:29:35.396 --> 00:29:38.782
<v Josh Sparkes>So I've got a a query about something,
I need a new report,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5298-2
00:29:38.782 --> 00:29:41.490
<v Josh Sparkes>need to delete report,
need to change a report.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5298-3
00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:45.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Are there any other things besides those
that come in at a high level?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5331-0
00:29:45.057 --> 00:29:49.120
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>The the new report one probably covers
two different things.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5331-1
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:54.449
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>So a new regular report or a new one off
report and that's obviously difference</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5331-2
00:29:54.449 --> 00:29:57.513
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>there.
Regular report being it would become a</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5313-0
00:29:54.977 --> 00:29:55.257
<v Josh Sparkes>Hmm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5331-3
00:29:57.513 --> 00:30:00.577
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>scheduled thing that happened every
whatever.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5324-0
00:29:57.897 --> 00:29:59.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5346-0
00:30:00.777 --> 00:30:05.396
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>The information would require be fairly
similar other than the fact that we would</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5346-1
00:30:05.396 --> 00:30:07.537
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>need a frequency for the regular ones.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5345-0
00:30:07.977 --> 00:30:08.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5367-0
00:30:08.857 --> 00:30:13.531
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>But they are probably slightly different
requests to a one-off report and a</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5360-0
00:30:11.737 --> 00:30:13.377
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, we can.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5367-1
00:30:13.531 --> 00:30:14.577
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>irregular report.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5414-0
00:30:15.097 --> 00:30:18.086
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Yeah, it's good to track those those,
those regular ones.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5371-0
00:30:15.257 --> 00:30:16.577
<v Josh Sparkes>Brush that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5372-0
00:30:16.137 --> 00:30:16.897
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>I can.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5414-1
00:30:18.086 --> 00:30:21.796
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>We probably want to just put some
governance around approval of that as</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5414-2
00:30:21.796 --> 00:30:24.269
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>well,
so that we're not continually just adding</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5414-3
00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:26.897
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>to the reporting landscape all the time,
but yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5412-0
00:30:25.097 --> 00:30:26.497
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5410-0
00:30:26.137 --> 00:30:26.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5411-0
00:30:26.617 --> 00:30:27.137
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5452-0
00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:42.577
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5483-0
00:30:42.617 --> 00:30:45.324
<v Mark Sedge>Whatever.
All of these are things that you can ask</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5483-1
00:30:45.324 --> 00:30:48.668
<v Mark Sedge>smart, you know, smart.
Ask at the front end to give you clues</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5483-2
00:30:48.668 --> 00:30:51.109
<v Mark Sedge>about what you're then subsequently
building,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5477-0
00:30:49.502 --> 00:30:49.702
Hello.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5483-3
00:30:51.109 --> 00:30:53.657
<v Mark Sedge>because it enables you to size the work,
right?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5487-0
00:30:53.497 --> 00:30:57.017
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, absolutely. Cool.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5514-0
00:30:56.777 --> 00:31:00.925
<v Josh Sparkes>All right, we can do,
we can do some branching in the form to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5514-1
00:31:00.925 --> 00:31:04.537
<v Josh Sparkes>get us, get all the data we need there.
That is cool.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5536-0
00:31:03.577 --> 00:31:05.938
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>We can,
when Em and I go back with the various</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5536-1
00:31:05.938 --> 00:31:09.003
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>bits of information,
we'll include something on that as well</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5536-2
00:31:09.003 --> 00:31:12.017
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>about how we would like it to to flow,
if that makes sense.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5527-0
00:31:09.977 --> 00:31:10.497
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5532-0
00:31:11.097 --> 00:31:11.937
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5574-0
00:31:11.737 --> 00:31:14.894
<v Josh Sparkes>Perfect. Yeah. All right.
I mean that's the that's,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5574-1
00:31:14.894 --> 00:31:19.145
<v Josh Sparkes>that's the bulk of it. And then approvals,
we've touched on SLASOLAS,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5574-2
00:31:19.145 --> 00:31:23.699
<v Josh Sparkes>I believe where we've landed at the
moment is that we're going with an ask</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5574-3
00:31:23.699 --> 00:31:25.217
<v Josh Sparkes>wide overlay of 48 hours.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5590-0
00:31:27.177 --> 00:31:31.554
<v Josh Sparkes>Joe, please remind me,
was that for response or for completion?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5590-1
00:31:31.554 --> 00:31:33.537
<v Josh Sparkes>And is that the right number?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5659-0
00:31:33.897 --> 00:31:38.846
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I don't know if we've decided that yet.
I think we still probably need to have</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5596-0
00:31:36.417 --> 00:31:36.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Um.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5601-0
00:31:36.577 --> 00:31:37.537
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>It's risky.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5659-1
00:31:38.846 --> 00:31:42.855
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>that approach and that discussion from an
ask wide perspective.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5609-0
00:31:39.377 --> 00:31:39.497
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5659-2
00:31:42.855 --> 00:31:47.365
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I think what we will see about OLAS
though is we will take a structured</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5659-3
00:31:47.365 --> 00:31:51.562
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>approach to that again across ask.
So we'll probably work on OLAS.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5659-4
00:31:51.562 --> 00:31:53.817
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So each task will have an OLA again.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5702-0
00:31:53.897 --> 00:31:57.402
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Instant,
which will then start to inform what our</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5702-1
00:31:57.402 --> 00:32:01.187
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>SLA should be and we'll discuss how we
roll that out,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5702-2
00:32:01.187 --> 00:32:06.794
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I suppose when we are at day one and how
we bring our stakeholders involved and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5702-3
00:32:06.794 --> 00:32:08.897
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>included in that conversation.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5765-0
00:32:09.177 --> 00:32:13.324
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I think it's a good thing and we take
this opportunity to start doing that work</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5765-1
00:32:13.324 --> 00:32:17.057
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>now before we get to day one,
so that we're in a good place that we can</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5765-2
00:32:17.057 --> 00:32:20.168
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>just put them in the system and start
working towards them.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5765-3
00:32:20.168 --> 00:32:23.901
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>But there's obviously lots of
conversations that will be needed outside</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5737-0
00:32:22.217 --> 00:32:22.457
<v Mark Sedge>And.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5765-4
00:32:23.901 --> 00:32:27.737
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>of ask to do that as well. So yeah,
it's something we'll need to kind of.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5746-0
00:32:24.537 --> 00:32:25.297
<v Mark Sedge>Yes.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5831-0
00:32:26.857 --> 00:32:29.958
<v Mark Sedge>And and I'll just, just,
I'll just add to that Jill, if I may,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5770-0
00:32:27.737 --> 00:32:29.297
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Take an ask approach on.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5766-0
00:32:28.097 --> 00:32:28.497
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5831-1
00:32:29.958 --> 00:32:33.454
<v Mark Sedge>I know I've said it to you on it,
there's the other ones where we talk</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5783-0
00:32:31.737 --> 00:32:34.017
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah, that's OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5831-2
00:32:33.454 --> 00:32:37.195
<v Mark Sedge>about it. But just for these guys,
we'd also the the benefit of starting to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5831-3
00:32:37.195 --> 00:32:40.395
<v Mark Sedge>measure and report what we would do is do
a baselining exercise.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5831-4
00:32:40.395 --> 00:32:44.482
<v Mark Sedge>So when we look at establishing the OLA,
typically what we would do is you'd start</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5831-5
00:32:44.482 --> 00:32:46.697
<v Mark Sedge>running and you'd see what you're
typically.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5896-0
00:32:46.697 --> 00:32:49.543
<v Mark Sedge>Or throughput was against those sort of
composite items.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5896-1
00:32:49.543 --> 00:32:53.187
<v Mark Sedge>And then what we would do is then go,
well typically it takes this much,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5896-2
00:32:53.187 --> 00:32:56.682
<v Mark Sedge>you know this much time and then you can
set user expectation at the,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5896-3
00:32:56.682 --> 00:32:59.627
<v Mark Sedge>you know when they raise the request and
things like that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5896-4
00:32:59.627 --> 00:33:02.174
<v Mark Sedge>But the important thing is,
you know as Jill says,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5896-5
00:33:02.174 --> 00:33:06.118
<v Mark Sedge>we've got to tread carefully because what
you don't want to do is overcome it,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5896-6
00:33:06.118 --> 00:33:06.617
<v Mark Sedge>you don't.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5920-0
00:33:06.697 --> 00:33:10.976
<v Mark Sedge>Want to, you know, you know,
basically just set something that you cut</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5920-1
00:33:10.976 --> 00:33:15.497
<v Mark Sedge>that's unrealistic. That's the point.
And the baselining helps us do that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5908-0
00:33:13.257 --> 00:33:13.857
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5910-0
00:33:13.977 --> 00:33:14.497
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5921-0
00:33:15.737 --> 00:33:17.697
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Yeah, I'd anticipate.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5925-0
00:33:16.817 --> 00:33:18.697
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>And I think, sorry, Wayne, on you go.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5993-0
00:33:19.177 --> 00:33:22.965
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>I'm just going to say I'd anticipate for
the reporting team a lot of the SLAS or</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5993-1
00:33:22.965 --> 00:33:25.584
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>the OLAS as well.
I'll probably be based on the T-shirt</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5993-2
00:33:25.584 --> 00:33:28.249
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>sizing that the team do because there is
a wide variety.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5952-0
00:33:28.057 --> 00:33:28.577
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5993-3
00:33:28.249 --> 00:33:31.570
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Some of it is a quick extract from a
system that might take 5 minutes.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5993-4
00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:34.750
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Something else could be development of a
whole new Power BI report.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5993-5
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:38.257
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>There may be weeks and weeks of work and
requirements gathering, etcetera.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5981-0
00:33:36.617 --> 00:33:37.857
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, of course.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5982-0
00:33:37.777 --> 00:33:39.337
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Mm-hmm. Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/5996-0
00:33:38.697 --> 00:33:39.337
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6008-0
00:33:40.057 --> 00:33:43.423
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I forgot you guys had that in place.
It might be worth sharing that actually</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6008-1
00:33:43.423 --> 00:33:46.482
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>what that matrix looks like.
I think that'd be useful for the guys to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6005-0
00:33:43.617 --> 00:33:45.257
<v Hall, Emma 14831>It shows, isn't it?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6008-2
00:33:46.482 --> 00:33:46.657
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>see.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6007-0
00:33:46.697 --> 00:33:47.257
<v Josh Sparkes>Hmm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6011-0
00:33:47.937 --> 00:33:48.577
<v Hall, Emma 14831>It OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6041-0
00:33:48.657 --> 00:33:54.217
<v Josh Sparkes>Very much, yeah. OK. Thanks for,
thanks for clarifying and prioritisation.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6041-1
00:33:54.217 --> 00:33:56.737
<v Josh Sparkes>Talks a little bit. Come up, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6101-0
00:33:54.777 --> 00:33:59.270
<v Mark Sedge>Sorry, sorry, Josh, forgive me, Wayne,
when you talked about do you treat data</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6101-1
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.830
<v Mark Sedge>extracts as different from report
construct?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6046-0
00:33:59.482 --> 00:33:59.642
Yeah.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6101-2
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:06.494
<v Mark Sedge>Because that would be another offering.
You would have thought that somebody will</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6101-3
00:34:06.494 --> 00:34:10.532
<v Mark Sedge>come along and say I just want a data
extract, stick it in a CSV file,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6101-4
00:34:10.532 --> 00:34:14.457
<v Mark Sedge>let me play with it and then you've got a
different set of criteria.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6120-0
00:34:14.537 --> 00:34:17.701
<v Mark Sedge>Around that,
as if they're saying I actually want a</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6120-1
00:34:17.701 --> 00:34:21.717
<v Mark Sedge>crafted report, you know,
caressed in a way that I can present to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6120-2
00:34:21.717 --> 00:34:23.177
<v Mark Sedge>leadership or something.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6178-0
00:34:23.057 --> 00:34:26.476
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>In some ways we do.
I guess the the bigger requests which we</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6178-1
00:34:26.476 --> 00:34:31.072
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>will start to get more of in the future
because we do have another program on the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6178-2
00:34:31.072 --> 00:34:33.875
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>go to try and create this new firm data
platform.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6178-3
00:34:33.875 --> 00:34:37.294
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>So the bigger requests right now tend to
be Emma and Gordon,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6178-4
00:34:37.294 --> 00:34:40.097
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>you can jump in and correct me if I'm
wrong here.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6240-0
00:34:40.457 --> 00:34:43.783
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>But the bigger requests tend to be
managed through Jira.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6240-1
00:34:43.783 --> 00:34:46.933
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>At the moment they become kind of more
project based,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6187-0
00:34:44.057 --> 00:34:44.657
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6194-0
00:34:45.977 --> 00:34:46.737
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6191-0
00:34:46.057 --> 00:34:46.177
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6240-2
00:34:46.933 --> 00:34:50.842
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>whereas the smaller ones it does tend to
be a a share will ticket.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6240-3
00:34:50.842 --> 00:34:54.926
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>We can mature in terms of how we split
that work in the team as well.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6240-4
00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:59.652
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Right now we might have a really senior
analyst still handling data extracts for</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6240-5
00:34:59.652 --> 00:35:00.177
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>instance.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6267-0
00:35:00.497 --> 00:35:04.088
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>So I think through this we can start to
get a bit smarter and how we work and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6267-1
00:35:04.088 --> 00:35:07.726
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>maybe have more junior people in the team
doing those extracts and and kind of</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6258-0
00:35:06.777 --> 00:35:07.297
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6267-2
00:35:07.726 --> 00:35:10.857
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>reserving time for senior analysts to do
the development type work.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6266-0
00:35:09.897 --> 00:35:11.577
<v Mark Sedge>OK, yeah, makes sense.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6305-0
00:35:14.817 --> 00:35:19.381
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, thanks. Yeah, Wayne,
Wayne gave us a low down on the the Data</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6305-1
00:35:19.381 --> 00:35:24.290
<v Josh Sparkes>Lake project and the Jira approach.
I don't know if Tim's on the call,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6305-2
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:28.577
<v Josh Sparkes>but he's also explained that to us.
So all all aligned there.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6349-0
00:35:29.097 --> 00:35:32.607
<v Josh Sparkes>We prioritisation,
we spoke a bit about that. Yeah,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6349-1
00:35:32.607 --> 00:35:38.209
<v Josh Sparkes>I was going to say do we want to kind of
auto prioritise based on whether it's new</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6349-2
00:35:38.209 --> 00:35:41.719
<v Josh Sparkes>and change and then help is a lower
prioritisation.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6349-3
00:35:41.719 --> 00:35:47.457
<v Josh Sparkes>But I think we've already kind of covered
that so I can update that as we discussed.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6392-0
00:35:47.897 --> 00:35:52.057
<v Josh Sparkes>E-mail notifications.
I said at the start from what my take so</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6392-1
00:35:52.057 --> 00:35:57.339
<v Josh Sparkes>far of all the sessions is that we need
to kind of align on what emails we will</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6392-2
00:35:57.339 --> 00:36:02.291
<v Josh Sparkes>be sending out in future because I know
it's been a been a topic in recent</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6392-3
00:36:02.291 --> 00:36:03.017
<v Josh Sparkes>history so.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6428-0
00:36:03.257 --> 00:36:08.552
<v Josh Sparkes>I would normally think that on these
requests you would send an e-mail to the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6428-1
00:36:08.552 --> 00:36:13.440
<v Josh Sparkes>request that upon completion,
but as I said we we do notify them in the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6428-2
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.174
<v Josh Sparkes>employee centre,
probably trying to limit emails where</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6428-3
00:36:17.174 --> 00:36:18.057
<v Josh Sparkes>where we can.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6454-0
00:36:18.457 --> 00:36:22.786
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know if anybody has a a strong
view on whether from their experience</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6454-1
00:36:22.786 --> 00:36:26.777
<v Josh Sparkes>this needs to get an e-mail on completion
or even on receipt. Hey Tim.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6514-0
00:36:28.177 --> 00:36:31.884
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Hello, mate. Yeah, sorry.
Going back to the prioritisation on</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6465-0
00:36:30.577 --> 00:36:31.217
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6514-1
00:36:31.884 --> 00:36:35.353
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>previous workshops,
we've actually discussed prioritising</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6514-2
00:36:35.353 --> 00:36:38.701
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>based on persona.
So maybe a VIP you mentioned earlier,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6514-3
00:36:38.701 --> 00:36:41.572
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Gordon,
you get you see levels come in and they</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6485-0
00:36:39.217 --> 00:36:39.457
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6514-4
00:36:41.572 --> 00:36:45.459
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>want it delivering now.
Maybe it's we could do something on that</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6492-0
00:36:41.697 --> 00:36:42.097
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6501-0
00:36:44.017 --> 00:36:44.377
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>They.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6514-5
00:36:45.459 --> 00:36:45.937
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as well.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6555-0
00:36:45.897 --> 00:36:50.532
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah. The issue we'd have there, Tom,
is that most of the requests would come</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6555-1
00:36:50.532 --> 00:36:54.869
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>through practice executive for a
secretary rather than from that C-suite</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6555-2
00:36:54.869 --> 00:36:58.969
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>or partner level themselves.
So how we'd identify who's requested it</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6555-3
00:36:58.969 --> 00:37:02.297
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>from that? I don't know.
That might be different, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6557-0
00:37:00.377 --> 00:37:04.329
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It can be, yeah,
you could do it requested for on behalf</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6557-1
00:37:04.329 --> 00:37:04.537
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6568-0
00:37:05.217 --> 00:37:08.417
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Oh, OK. That'd be good. Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6573-0
00:37:06.457 --> 00:37:11.457
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>That'll be work. Yeah, that may work.
That's a good one. I like that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6566-0
00:37:08.457 --> 00:37:09.097
<v Josh Sparkes>Mm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6569-0
00:37:10.057 --> 00:37:10.257
<v Josh Sparkes>3.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6582-0
00:37:12.457 --> 00:37:14.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I I think.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6583-0
00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:15.817
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I think just sorry, Josh, are you all?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6596-0
00:37:16.297 --> 00:37:19.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Uh, I feel like, yeah, go on Jill, you go,
you go.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6590-0
00:37:16.777 --> 00:37:16.817
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6645-0
00:37:18.457 --> 00:37:21.180
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I was,
I was just going to come back to the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6645-1
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.202
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>e-mail notifications.
I think that's perhaps on persona as well.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6614-0
00:37:24.937 --> 00:37:25.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Hmm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6645-2
00:37:25.202 --> 00:37:29.967
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>It depends on who that is and whether
they're going to be sitting in service</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6645-3
00:37:29.967 --> 00:37:34.918
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>now or whether they will be only going
into it when they've got something to do</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6645-4
00:37:34.918 --> 00:37:35.537
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>on it, so.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6663-0
00:37:35.817 --> 00:37:38.771
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>And yeah,
we probably just need to agree that maybe</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6663-1
00:37:38.771 --> 00:37:43.316
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>at an enterprise level to start with what
that looks like and work from there I</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6729-0
00:37:43.177 --> 00:37:46.913
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>It's a big change curve for this firm.
You guys have probably heard it in other</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6663-2
00:37:43.316 --> 00:37:43.657
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>think.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6729-1
00:37:46.913 --> 00:37:49.248
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>workshops,
but there is a kind of narrative that,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6729-2
00:37:49.248 --> 00:37:52.517
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>and I don't believe it's true,
but there is a narrative that partners</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6729-3
00:37:52.517 --> 00:37:56.346
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>won't click on links and that we have to
attach things and almost spoon feed them</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6729-4
00:37:56.346 --> 00:37:59.008
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>with information.
So there will be that change curve and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6729-5
00:37:59.008 --> 00:38:02.697
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>we'll probably need some change support
to be able to to handle some of that I</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6729-6
00:38:02.697 --> 00:38:02.977
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>think.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6758-0
00:38:04.377 --> 00:38:07.679
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, OK. Yeah,
that that was kind of what I what I took</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6723-0
00:38:04.897 --> 00:38:05.057
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6758-1
00:38:07.679 --> 00:38:10.633
<v Josh Sparkes>as well.
I was just kind of writing down what what</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6744-0
00:38:09.897 --> 00:38:10.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6758-2
00:38:10.633 --> 00:38:13.993
<v Josh Sparkes>I'd seen previously,
but that is my my learning gear also</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6780-0
00:38:13.337 --> 00:38:17.247
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>I think the term's suggestion on the
prioritisation though if if if the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6758-3
00:38:13.993 --> 00:38:14.457
<v Josh Sparkes>aligned.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6780-1
00:38:17.247 --> 00:38:20.070
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>request can be submitted on behalf of
someone else,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6764-0
00:38:17.777 --> 00:38:18.017
<v Josh Sparkes>Hmm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6780-2
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.057
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>I think that's that would help us.
That would be good.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6862-0
00:38:23.737 --> 00:38:27.198
<v Mark Sedge>We we do that as typical. Anyway,
to be honest, on any request,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6862-1
00:38:27.198 --> 00:38:31.254
<v Mark Sedge>you'd either request it for yourself or
request on behalf of someone else.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6799-0
00:38:27.457 --> 00:38:28.217
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, cool.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6862-2
00:38:31.254 --> 00:38:35.742
<v Mark Sedge>It's a pretty I I can't remember whether
that's something that's gone right across</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6812-0
00:38:32.337 --> 00:38:32.577
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6862-3
00:38:35.742 --> 00:38:38.122
<v Mark Sedge>Jill,
but I'm pretty certain that this Jill</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6862-4
00:38:38.122 --> 00:38:42.556
<v Mark Sedge>just dropped off. Oh no, you're there.
Haven't you just moved on my screen? Yeah,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6839-0
00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:40.737
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah, no, I'm here.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6838-0
00:38:40.097 --> 00:38:40.657
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What she said.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6844-0
00:38:41.897 --> 00:38:42.417
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6862-5
00:38:42.556 --> 00:38:43.097
<v Mark Sedge>so it was.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6875-0
00:38:43.257 --> 00:38:49.242
<v Mark Sedge>Something that we said we we'd have right
across the ability, didn't we? Yeah, good,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6873-0
00:38:46.297 --> 00:38:49.737
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah, it's going to be necessary. Yeah,
definitely.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6874-0
00:38:48.417 --> 00:38:50.097
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Cool. That's good.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6875-1
00:38:49.242 --> 00:38:50.017
<v Mark Sedge>100%, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6920-0
00:38:52.617 --> 00:38:56.286
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, good stuff.
I think we're we're coming to decisions</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6920-1
00:38:56.286 --> 00:38:59.496
<v Josh Sparkes>in places,
some things to that need to go to ask</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6920-2
00:38:59.496 --> 00:39:02.379
<v Josh Sparkes>level,
some things need to go to enterprise</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6920-3
00:39:02.379 --> 00:39:05.392
<v Josh Sparkes>level,
but we are coming to decisions at this</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6920-4
00:39:05.392 --> 00:39:08.537
<v Josh Sparkes>level integration wise.
I'm not foreseeing any.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6935-0
00:39:08.617 --> 00:39:14.337
<v Josh Sparkes>To to bring this to life as as we've
designed it, just want to align on that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6929-0
00:39:12.737 --> 00:39:13.217
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>No.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6967-0
00:39:13.497 --> 00:39:18.779
<v Mark Sedge>It might be worth just referencing that
the it's none for this specifically,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6967-1
00:39:18.779 --> 00:39:24.062
<v Mark Sedge>but you'll utilize the core foundational
user data to identify the users and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6967-2
00:39:24.062 --> 00:39:26.257
<v Mark Sedge>things like that. Josh might be.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6985-0
00:39:26.377 --> 00:39:29.963
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
the the the standard required data to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6989-0
00:39:27.337 --> 00:39:31.612
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, exactly.
But it might just be worth referencing it</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6985-1
00:39:29.963 --> 00:39:32.897
<v Josh Sparkes>make the whole thing work. OK, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/6989-1
00:39:31.612 --> 00:39:33.937
<v Mark Sedge>just for completeness, I think.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7014-0
00:39:35.417 --> 00:39:40.554
<v Josh Sparkes>Can do yet.
So because you're able to say who it's on</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7017-0
00:39:39.897 --> 00:39:42.092
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, exactly. Yeah,
just identify the user.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7014-1
00:39:40.554 --> 00:39:43.217
<v Josh Sparkes>behalf of and whatnot, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7017-1
00:39:42.092 --> 00:39:45.457
<v Mark Sedge>Hello so and so you you want to raise a
report request. Here you go.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7054-0
00:39:46.017 --> 00:39:48.526
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I guess I just saw that mark is coming</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7054-1
00:39:48.526 --> 00:39:51.703
<v Josh Sparkes>through a higher level and then this is
lower. But yeah,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7090-0
00:39:50.137 --> 00:39:52.670
<v Mark Sedge>OK, forget it.
I just it was just it was just a</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7054-2
00:39:51.703 --> 00:39:54.937
<v Josh Sparkes>I I could put it there for clarity.
I could put it there.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7090-1
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:56.786
<v Mark Sedge>reflection because if someone came at
this blank and said what do you mean no</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7057-0
00:39:55.937 --> 00:39:56.057
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7090-2
00:39:56.786 --> 00:40:00.111
<v Mark Sedge>integrations? Well,
how am I going to know who that person is?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7090-3
00:40:00.111 --> 00:40:02.697
<v Mark Sedge>All I was going to do is just say none
specific.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7090-4
00:40:02.697 --> 00:40:05.177
<v Mark Sedge>It's it's I'm belt and braces mate,
ignore me.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7127-0
00:40:05.097 --> 00:40:09.433
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.
I'll put it in for belt and braces, OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7127-1
00:40:09.433 --> 00:40:13.650
<v Josh Sparkes>And then on a reporting level,
so each operator is going to have their</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7127-2
00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:17.274
<v Josh Sparkes>own agent workspace,
which which I can show you guys kind of</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7127-3
00:40:17.274 --> 00:40:20.897
<v Josh Sparkes>looks like a dashboard and we can put
what we want on there.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7176-0
00:40:21.697 --> 00:40:25.559
<v Josh Sparkes>Pending items, items assigned to us,
high priority things,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7176-1
00:40:25.559 --> 00:40:28.962
<v Josh Sparkes>things that are running towards end of
their clock.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7176-2
00:40:28.962 --> 00:40:34.330
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's going to be the operator level
dashboard or reports and then above that</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7176-3
00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:38.977
<v Josh Sparkes>we we're thinking of having kind of team
level reports. So we want to.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7214-0
00:40:39.417 --> 00:40:44.280
<v Josh Sparkes>Come up with what the the team leads
might think are are useful things to show</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7214-1
00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.543
<v Josh Sparkes>on a report.
So probably how many tasks assigned and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7214-2
00:40:47.543 --> 00:40:50.868
<v Josh Sparkes>what types of tasks assigned and
completed, etcetera.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7214-3
00:40:50.868 --> 00:40:54.377
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll we'll come up with a view of
that for you guys.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7241-0
00:40:54.417 --> 00:40:57.548
<v Josh Sparkes>Guys,
I've actually got some suggestions on a</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7241-1
00:40:57.548 --> 00:41:02.995
<v Josh Sparkes>later slide actually, but would you,
would you have a view on that one, Gordon,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7241-2
00:41:02.995 --> 00:41:08.577
<v Josh Sparkes>Emma and Wayne on what you might like to
see in a team manager lead level report?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7244-0
00:41:09.777 --> 00:41:09.897
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7254-0
00:41:10.897 --> 00:41:13.434
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>I'll let Emma and Gordon go.
I've got a few ideas,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7254-1
00:41:13.434 --> 00:41:14.777
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>but I'll let those guys go.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7251-0
00:41:14.217 --> 00:41:14.377
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7314-0
00:41:16.297 --> 00:41:19.873
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I was just going to say as well, sorry,
we do do some level of reporting on this.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7314-1
00:41:19.873 --> 00:41:22.664
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I think we talked about it in one of the
other workshops, Josh,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7314-2
00:41:22.664 --> 00:41:24.627
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>in in terms of what we get out of
Sharewell.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7292-0
00:41:24.577 --> 00:41:24.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7314-3
00:41:24.627 --> 00:41:27.157
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So I'll I'll share that anyway so that
you've got a base,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7314-4
00:41:27.157 --> 00:41:29.817
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>but anything that we can improve on and
that would be great.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7369-0
00:41:28.897 --> 00:41:31.529
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, yeah.
The problem with the current report,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7321-0
00:41:30.857 --> 00:41:31.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Perfect. Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7369-1
00:41:31.529 --> 00:41:34.430
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>I guess, Joe, is it's not live. You know,
we refresh,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7369-2
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:36.954
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>it's in Power BI and it refreshes once a
week.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7331-0
00:41:34.697 --> 00:41:36.137
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Exactly, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7369-3
00:41:36.954 --> 00:41:41.090
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>So it's it's more of a look back at
what's happened rather than the current,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7340-0
00:41:37.537 --> 00:41:38.297
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7341-0
00:41:37.737 --> 00:41:37.977
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7369-4
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.668
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>you know,
current state of which a team we'd be</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7364-0
00:41:41.537 --> 00:41:43.577
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah, where we are, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7369-5
00:41:43.668 --> 00:41:45.817
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>more interested in what's happening now.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7365-0
00:41:45.297 --> 00:41:45.657
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7408-0
00:41:46.177 --> 00:41:49.962
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>So yeah,
I guess current Q levels for each agent</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7408-1
00:41:49.962 --> 00:41:54.443
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>would be useful.
How many they've got currently assigned,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7408-2
00:41:54.443 --> 00:41:59.386
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>how many they've completed,
that sort of thing would be useful.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7408-3
00:41:59.386 --> 00:42:00.777
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>You get any other?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7421-0
00:41:59.777 --> 00:42:02.112
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.
And it's kind of come coming close to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7421-1
00:42:02.112 --> 00:42:06.197
<v Hall, Emma 14831>kind of deadlines, things like that.
So we can keep an eye and kind of chase</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7414-0
00:42:03.897 --> 00:42:04.697
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Mhm, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7421-2
00:42:06.197 --> 00:42:07.577
<v Hall, Emma 14831>up. That would be helpful.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7435-0
00:42:08.577 --> 00:42:11.224
<v Josh Sparkes>All right, perfect. Yeah, that's, uh,
that's what I was thinking as well.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7429-0
00:42:10.777 --> 00:42:10.937
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Yes.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7435-1
00:42:11.224 --> 00:42:11.617
<v Josh Sparkes>It's great.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7431-0
00:42:11.697 --> 00:42:12.577
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7500-0
00:42:12.337 --> 00:42:15.311
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>It's probably similar to many of the
other teams to be honest.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7500-1
00:42:15.311 --> 00:42:17.624
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>I think it's across askable as much as
possible,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7449-0
00:42:16.937 --> 00:42:17.337
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7500-2
00:42:17.624 --> 00:42:19.795
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>not want to put round pegs into square
holes,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7500-3
00:42:19.795 --> 00:42:23.193
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>but trying to kind of mirror what the
team leads are keeping an eye on.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7500-4
00:42:23.193 --> 00:42:26.781
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>So your things like agent tickets and
stuff that I think came up in the the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7500-5
00:42:26.781 --> 00:42:29.377
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>people workshop would be useful for this
team as well.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7570-0
00:42:29.457 --> 00:42:32.703
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>One more nuanced one,
particularly for the reporting team that</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7570-1
00:42:32.703 --> 00:42:36.979
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>I would be quite keen to see is just the
number of scheduled reports that we have.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7513-0
00:42:33.137 --> 00:42:33.257
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7570-2
00:42:36.979 --> 00:42:40.843
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>There is a kind of constant push to try
and reduce the number of scheduled</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7570-3
00:42:40.843 --> 00:42:45.068
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>reports and we'll try and start to push
people towards more self-service options.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7570-4
00:42:45.068 --> 00:42:48.417
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>So just to keep an eye on that trend of
are we going up or down?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7577-0
00:42:49.457 --> 00:42:53.286
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Down in terms of those scheduled reports,
are we decommissioning more than we're</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7568-0
00:42:50.737 --> 00:42:52.137
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Mhm, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7577-1
00:42:53.286 --> 00:42:54.137
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>creating, I guess?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7619-0
00:42:56.417 --> 00:42:59.631
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, great. Yeah,
that's that's perfect type of thing that</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7619-1
00:42:59.631 --> 00:43:02.569
<v Josh Sparkes>we will try and absolutely standardise
where we can,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7619-2
00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:07.169
<v Josh Sparkes>but throughout the workshops there's been
a few of these these kind of niche needs</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7619-3
00:43:07.169 --> 00:43:10.217
<v Josh Sparkes>per team to try and cater.
So that's good information.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7666-0
00:43:11.297 --> 00:43:15.907
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. And that's really the bulk of it.
I think I had some couple of calls to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7666-1
00:43:15.907 --> 00:43:20.517
<v Josh Sparkes>action here. Let me just click through.
So reports we've just talked about,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7666-2
00:43:20.517 --> 00:43:23.671
<v Josh Sparkes>but as I said,
there's a few things that we've done</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7666-3
00:43:23.671 --> 00:43:27.857
<v Josh Sparkes>historically and we can recommend,
but it's it's really going to be.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7719-0
00:43:27.937 --> 00:43:31.461
<v Josh Sparkes>Based on real life.
So actually that that bottom one maybe</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7719-1
00:43:31.461 --> 00:43:35.463
<v Josh Sparkes>somewhat reflects what we're saying in
the report portfolio. Yeah,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7719-2
00:43:35.463 --> 00:43:39.525
<v Josh Sparkes>SLA compliance and task turn around.
So kind of normal stuff there,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7719-3
00:43:39.525 --> 00:43:42.810
<v Josh Sparkes>but I think we've spoken about the the
important bits,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7719-4
00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:45.737
<v Josh Sparkes>but we have some some things to compare
against.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7772-0
00:43:45.857 --> 00:43:49.163
<v Josh Sparkes>On that knowledge management,
if I click the button,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7772-1
00:43:49.163 --> 00:43:53.904
<v Josh Sparkes>it's going to do a bit of a distracting
demo, but on the on the left there.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7772-2
00:43:53.904 --> 00:43:58.895
<v Josh Sparkes>So if there's things that you guys have,
do you have at the moment any employee</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7772-3
00:43:58.895 --> 00:44:03.761
<v Josh Sparkes>facing articles to maybe help employees
get what they need without needing to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7772-4
00:44:03.761 --> 00:44:04.697
<v Josh Sparkes>send a request?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7774-0
00:44:05.497 --> 00:44:05.657
<v Josh Sparkes>To.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7822-0
00:44:06.817 --> 00:44:09.489
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>We don't,
but I think recently there's been a</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7778-0
00:44:07.497 --> 00:44:08.377
<v Hall, Emma 14831>No.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7822-1
00:44:09.489 --> 00:44:14.078
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>couple of how to videos put together,
how to get things out of three etcetera,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7789-0
00:44:12.937 --> 00:44:13.177
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7822-2
00:44:14.078 --> 00:44:16.634
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>which every everyone's got access to
three,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7822-3
00:44:16.634 --> 00:44:20.004
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>so but they just come to us because we
can do it quicker.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7800-0
00:44:17.697 --> 00:44:18.057
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7822-4
00:44:20.004 --> 00:44:23.257
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>So maybe if we educate them on how to do
it themselves.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7827-0
00:44:24.177 --> 00:44:26.857
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, great. Well, well done.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7826-0
00:44:24.417 --> 00:44:25.017
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7886-0
00:44:26.017 --> 00:44:29.655
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>It's a really good show, Gordon.
I think that because we we are,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7886-1
00:44:29.655 --> 00:44:34.077
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>the team are kind of in a transition
phase as we are moving more towards Power</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7886-2
00:44:34.077 --> 00:44:37.547
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>BI dashboards etcetera.
So I think I would definitely like to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7886-3
00:44:37.547 --> 00:44:41.577
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>make more use of that stuff in the future,
those kind of how to guides.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7899-0
00:44:41.937 --> 00:44:45.724
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Details of what is available in Fusion,
details of what is available in the free,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7899-1
00:44:45.724 --> 00:44:47.617
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>just so we can better signpost to people.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7895-0
00:44:45.897 --> 00:44:46.377
<v Josh Sparkes>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7897-0
00:44:47.137 --> 00:44:47.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7961-0
00:44:48.577 --> 00:44:51.614
<v Josh Sparkes>Perfect. Yeah, because we can put,
we can put.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7961-1
00:44:51.614 --> 00:44:56.654
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm trying to skip back so I can see it.
If people go into the knowledge base</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7961-2
00:44:56.654 --> 00:45:00.014
<v Josh Sparkes>specifically,
they can search and come up with with</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7961-3
00:45:00.014 --> 00:45:03.632
<v Josh Sparkes>anything to do with reports,
maybe find what they need,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7961-4
00:45:03.632 --> 00:45:07.897
<v Josh Sparkes>but also in the actual form that we
talked about, we can display.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8005-0
00:45:08.337 --> 00:45:13.483
<v Josh Sparkes>Different knowledge articles based on
what they've selected and even based on</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/7972-0
00:45:12.417 --> 00:45:13.177
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>You could.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8005-1
00:45:13.483 --> 00:45:17.706
<v Josh Sparkes>what they've typed in.
So we'll we'll do that in a smart way to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8005-2
00:45:17.706 --> 00:45:21.137
<v Josh Sparkes>try and get them to self-serve as much as
they can.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8056-0
00:45:19.377 --> 00:45:22.393
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>We do also have just to add that just one
of the other team,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8056-1
00:45:22.393 --> 00:45:24.915
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>they're not moving on to ServiceNow at
this point,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8056-2
00:45:24.915 --> 00:45:28.772
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>but the data governance team obviously
works quite closely with the reporting</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8056-3
00:45:28.772 --> 00:45:31.096
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>team.
They've got quite a good SharePoint with</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8056-4
00:45:31.096 --> 00:45:34.706
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>stuff like data definitions etcetera on
there, but it's not really used.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8056-5
00:45:34.706 --> 00:45:37.425
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>I think if it was more in this kind of
knowledge base,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8056-6
00:45:37.425 --> 00:45:39.057
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>it might be a bit more useful to.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8050-0
00:45:38.417 --> 00:45:38.617
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8064-0
00:45:39.057 --> 00:45:41.621
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>The business,
so there is probably content that we</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8064-1
00:45:41.621 --> 00:45:42.777
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>could provide for that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8067-0
00:45:43.297 --> 00:45:44.057
<v Josh Sparkes>Perfect.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8068-0
00:45:43.377 --> 00:45:45.577
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah, that'd be good, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8065-0
00:45:43.497 --> 00:45:43.737
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8119-0
00:45:46.657 --> 00:45:50.603
<v Josh Sparkes>All right, good stuff. Yeah,
I think that that could that could drive</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8119-1
00:45:50.603 --> 00:45:53.591
<v Josh Sparkes>a lot of efficiency. That's nice to hear.
All right.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8119-2
00:45:53.591 --> 00:45:56.692
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's it's probably seems like a
relative quick one.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8119-3
00:45:56.692 --> 00:46:00.638
<v Josh Sparkes>So we kind of had a quick discussion
previously and now we're on this</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8119-4
00:46:00.638 --> 00:46:02.217
<v Josh Sparkes>iteration I think we've got.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8185-0
00:46:02.497 --> 00:46:06.425
<v Josh Sparkes>Really good feedback here.
I should be able to come up with now</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8185-1
00:46:06.425 --> 00:46:10.477
<v Josh Sparkes>somewhat final designs.
There's a few pieces there that are still</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8185-2
00:46:10.477 --> 00:46:14.283
<v Josh Sparkes>pending definition,
but we'll next phase for us guys is going</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8185-3
00:46:14.283 --> 00:46:19.316
<v Josh Sparkes>to be writing user stories over the next
weeks and we'll share those with you and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8185-4
00:46:19.316 --> 00:46:22.017
<v Josh Sparkes>you'll have visibility of what we're
we're.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8195-0
00:46:22.097 --> 00:46:26.616
<v Josh Sparkes>Planning to design and you'll be able to
see what we're coming up with and we'll</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8195-1
00:46:26.616 --> 00:46:28.457
<v Josh Sparkes>be able to discuss that and then.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8235-0
00:46:30.017 --> 00:46:32.483
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
we will go into build and then there'll</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8235-1
00:46:32.483 --> 00:46:36.826
<v Josh Sparkes>be a testing phase and as I mentioned at
the start there'll be a training phase.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8235-2
00:46:36.826 --> 00:46:40.793
<v Josh Sparkes>So you'll have a whole bunch of
experience in the the system before we we</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8235-3
00:46:40.793 --> 00:46:42.777
<v Josh Sparkes>get to live, which is next September.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8263-0
00:46:43.777 --> 00:46:47.428
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>The additional info that you want,
you're looking for us,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8245-0
00:46:44.177 --> 00:46:46.457
<v Josh Sparkes>If it was anything, don't worry, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8236-0
00:46:44.337 --> 00:46:45.737
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>That's great.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8263-1
00:46:47.428 --> 00:46:51.017
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>are you happy for just upload that to the
teams channel?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8284-0
00:46:52.577 --> 00:46:56.075
<v Josh Sparkes>The the form level stuff we discussed
earlier. Yeah, yeah, please,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8287-0
00:46:54.497 --> 00:46:59.617
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's fine. Yeah,
we can do that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8284-1
00:46:56.075 --> 00:46:58.737
<v Josh Sparkes>if you can upload to the team,
that'll be perfect.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8294-0
00:47:00.097 --> 00:47:03.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Nice one. That's great. Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8360-0
00:47:02.177 --> 00:47:04.493
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>I know,
I know you guys have already have it</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8360-1
00:47:04.493 --> 00:47:06.963
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>covered Josh,
but just to kind of emphasize it,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8360-2
00:47:06.963 --> 00:47:10.925
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>biggest part or a huge part of what the
team do is that scheduled reporting.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8360-3
00:47:10.925 --> 00:47:14.784
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>So we're I guess we're really relying on
reminders or you know tasks being</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8360-4
00:47:14.784 --> 00:47:19.107
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>automatically created within Cherwell for
the team that is the trigger for the team</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8360-5
00:47:19.107 --> 00:47:21.937
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>to then go produce that when we say
scheduled reports.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8384-0
00:47:21.937 --> 00:47:25.424
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>It's not like we've got a scheduler
that's automatically sending out reports</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8384-1
00:47:25.424 --> 00:47:27.552
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>for us.
It's the team are reminded to manually</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8384-2
00:47:27.552 --> 00:47:31.266
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>crank that report at various intervals.
So just to make sure that that's captured</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8378-0
00:47:30.537 --> 00:47:30.777
<v Josh Sparkes>Hmm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8384-3
00:47:31.266 --> 00:47:32.217
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>and understood, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8424-0
00:47:32.977 --> 00:47:36.670
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, OK. We, yeah,
we we are catering for scheduled tasks</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8424-1
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:41.176
<v Josh Sparkes>and things throughout the team.
So I I think we'll we'll tackle that in</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8424-2
00:47:41.176 --> 00:47:44.931
<v Josh Sparkes>the same in the same vein, but noted. OK,
right. Was there,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8411-0
00:47:43.297 --> 00:47:43.897
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8424-3
00:47:44.931 --> 00:47:47.497
<v Josh Sparkes>was there anything else realise that was?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8432-0
00:47:48.177 --> 00:47:52.937
<v Josh Sparkes>It will fly through, but it's, uh,
hopefully making sense, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8460-0
00:47:53.082 --> 00:47:55.445
Plus, Wayne,
just in terms of the schedule pause just

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8460-1
00:47:55.445 --> 00:47:57.371
'cause, you know,
most clients I work with,

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8460-2
00:47:57.371 --> 00:48:01.002
they try to reduce as you mentioned you
know reduce the number of scheduled ports.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8486-0
00:48:01.002 --> 00:48:04.226
Is there a?
Is there a ticket that is set to team to

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8486-1
00:48:04.226 --> 00:48:07.572
then say? Well,
actually it's been I'm making this up,

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8486-2
00:48:07.572 --> 00:48:11.282
let's say 90 days since the scheduled
port has been running.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8497-0
00:48:12.052 --> 00:48:15.452
Or 12 months since been running.
We've looked at usage.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8514-0
00:48:17.092 --> 00:48:21.134
We need to go back to the report on our
user to make sure that we validated that

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8514-1
00:48:21.134 --> 00:48:22.132
it's still relevant.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8519-0
00:48:22.402 --> 00:48:23.162
Let me close.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8530-0
00:48:23.162 --> 00:48:25.522
Is there any kind of ticket like that
that we need to kind of consider?

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8571-0
00:48:25.697 --> 00:48:29.729
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>It's it would be great if we could.
I think in the reporting catalogue at the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8571-1
00:48:29.729 --> 00:48:34.071
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>moment we do have a review date. Gordon,
I'm not sure how well we police it though.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8606-0
00:48:31.217 --> 00:48:34.858
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, we yeah, we do.
We do the the periodic screen test</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8571-2
00:48:34.071 --> 00:48:35.777
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>I don't know how rigorous we are.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8606-1
00:48:34.858 --> 00:48:39.776
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>basically where we'll we'll we'll add a
add a paragraph to the bottom of the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8573-0
00:48:38.017 --> 00:48:38.137
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8578-0
00:48:38.897 --> 00:48:39.377
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8606-2
00:48:39.776 --> 00:48:44.758
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>report saying you know please let us know
by X date if this is still required</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8606-3
00:48:44.758 --> 00:48:47.377
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>otherwise we're going to decommission it.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8614-0
00:48:47.377 --> 00:48:53.177
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, you decommission it to your screams,
you know? Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8640-0
00:48:53.532 --> 00:48:56.546
Josh,
you might be signing for us to just add

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8640-1
00:48:56.546 --> 00:49:01.000
in terms of you know filling when it says
it's new, it's scheduled,

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8640-2
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.572
it's run for X duration.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8664-0
00:49:02.732 --> 00:49:04.452
We just want to make it clear so then we.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8665-0
00:49:04.452 --> 00:49:04.892
Can.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8666-0
00:49:05.772 --> 00:49:09.268
You have some way of kind of reporting
against when the schedule reports can be

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8651-0
00:49:06.977 --> 00:49:07.297
<v Josh Sparkes>Hmm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8666-1
00:49:09.268 --> 00:49:11.452
closed out,
potentially closed down or validated.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8678-0
00:49:12.897 --> 00:49:15.057
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that's a good call. That's it.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8744-0
00:49:14.177 --> 00:49:18.634
<v Mark Sedge>Just just on that one, Josh, and again,
I'm literally shooting from the hip here</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8684-0
00:49:16.537 --> 00:49:16.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Hey.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8744-1
00:49:18.634 --> 00:49:22.101
<v Mark Sedge>with my thought processes,
but we could almost treat them in a</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8744-2
00:49:22.101 --> 00:49:26.448
<v Mark Sedge>similar way to the knowledge cycle that
says there's a review period that auto</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8744-3
00:49:26.448 --> 00:49:30.520
<v Mark Sedge>triggers an action for the team to just
go revisit. Is it still required?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8744-4
00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:34.097
<v Mark Sedge>Do you know what I mean?
I wonder if there's something we could.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8788-0
00:49:34.177 --> 00:49:37.502
<v Mark Sedge>We could look at.
So not only you've got the sort of the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8788-1
00:49:37.502 --> 00:49:40.243
<v Mark Sedge>wider,
a schedule view of you know like almost</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8788-2
00:49:40.243 --> 00:49:44.734
<v Mark Sedge>like a forward schedule of changes.
These are all the things that you've got</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8788-3
00:49:44.734 --> 00:49:49.050
<v Mark Sedge>going on and then each one of those
reports may be that after a period of</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8788-4
00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:50.217
<v Mark Sedge>time has a you know.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8841-0
00:49:51.457 --> 00:49:54.566
<v Mark Sedge>Flag up to say,
just check this is still in use. You know,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8841-1
00:49:54.566 --> 00:49:57.413
<v Mark Sedge>something like that.
Just checking in with the owner.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8841-2
00:49:57.413 --> 00:50:00.680
<v Mark Sedge>Is it still useful? Is it still working?
Yeah, go on, Parikh.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8841-3
00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.632
<v Mark Sedge>I was hoping you were going to jump in
and help me out.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8841-4
00:50:03.632 --> 00:50:07.005
<v Mark Sedge>You know what I'm talking.
You know where I'm you know what I'm</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8871-0
00:50:04.017 --> 00:50:08.873
<v Parik Narain>Exactly what you said. Yeah, yeah.
What we have done before is, you know,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8841-5
00:50:07.005 --> 00:50:08.217
<v Mark Sedge>visualising, don't you?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8839-0
00:50:08.537 --> 00:50:09.737
<v Josh Sparkes>The life cycle, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8871-1
00:50:08.873 --> 00:50:13.335
<v Parik Narain>we have kind of reserved a part of
knowledge for that same purpose.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8844-0
00:50:09.177 --> 00:50:09.457
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8871-2
00:50:13.335 --> 00:50:18.257
<v Parik Narain>So we can actually repurpose knowledge to
manage the reporting life cycle.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8916-0
00:50:19.137 --> 00:50:23.132
<v Parik Narain>Similar to your knowledge owners,
you can have reporting owners assigned to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8916-1
00:50:23.132 --> 00:50:25.498
<v Parik Narain>a report.
They can exactly leverage the same</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8916-2
00:50:25.498 --> 00:50:27.969
<v Parik Narain>knowledge capability you've seen in
knowledge,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8916-3
00:50:27.969 --> 00:50:31.491
<v Parik Narain>but they'll have their own area and
they'll have their own own own</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8916-4
00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:34.961
<v Parik Narain>classifications. For those,
they will not appear on the portal or</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8916-5
00:50:34.961 --> 00:50:35.697
<v Parik Narain>anything else.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8934-0
00:50:35.817 --> 00:50:39.214
<v Parik Narain>We'll receive them for internal review
and that's how we keep it kind of</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8934-1
00:50:39.214 --> 00:50:42.704
<v Parik Narain>out-of-the-box and give you the
capability to review these going forwards,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8932-0
00:50:42.337 --> 00:50:42.617
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8934-2
00:50:42.704 --> 00:50:42.937
<v Parik Narain>yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8985-0
00:50:45.217 --> 00:50:49.067
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>That would be great. We need that.
That would just just from a regular point</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8985-1
00:50:49.067 --> 00:50:51.517
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>of view,
you know it does kind of take that good</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8985-2
00:50:51.517 --> 00:50:55.317
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>governance and also just for me to kind
of be satisfied regularly getting a</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8985-3
00:50:55.317 --> 00:50:59.267
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>quarterly report to to make sure that
these have been reviewed and data owners</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8985-4
00:50:59.267 --> 00:51:02.617
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>to we could formalize that process a wee
bit. That would be super.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/8992-0
00:51:04.897 --> 00:51:09.017
<v Mark Sedge>We'll certainly investigate it. Go on,
Joe, you got your hand up.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9038-0
00:51:11.257 --> 00:51:16.179
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Just one thing that's popped into my head
is around how we share the reports at the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9038-1
00:51:16.179 --> 00:51:19.109
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>moment.
So I'm assuming you attach them basically</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9038-2
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:22.273
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>when you're sending them back out to your
requesters,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9038-3
00:51:22.273 --> 00:51:26.257
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>or do you point them to links of
centralized places where they are?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9028-0
00:51:24.137 --> 00:51:24.337
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9047-0
00:51:25.697 --> 00:51:30.057
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>The majority will be attachments to
emails, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9045-0
00:51:28.617 --> 00:51:30.377
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Attached, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9100-0
00:51:29.617 --> 00:51:32.131
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>OK,
which just makes me think about that</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9100-1
00:51:32.131 --> 00:51:36.915
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>other conversation we had in one of the
other workshops around how long or do</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9100-2
00:51:36.915 --> 00:51:41.207
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>they need to stay in the system or can
they be purged out of service?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9100-3
00:51:41.207 --> 00:51:45.132
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Now once they've been seen,
are they saved centrally elsewhere?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9100-4
00:51:45.132 --> 00:51:47.217
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Do we need to keep copies of them?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9112-0
00:51:47.857 --> 00:51:52.937
<v Josh Sparkes>The the the document management topic,
yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9132-0
00:51:51.857 --> 00:51:53.783
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah,
it's not necessarily one we need to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9110-0
00:51:52.537 --> 00:51:53.177
<v Hall, Emma 14831>I.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9132-1
00:51:53.783 --> 00:51:56.533
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>answer in this group,
but it's just something we need to be</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9118-0
00:51:55.257 --> 00:51:55.497
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9132-2
00:51:56.533 --> 00:51:59.697
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>really mindful of because there'll be
loads going through this team.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9143-0
00:51:59.937 --> 00:52:05.001
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>We probably don't get much beyond a few
months where someone would refer back to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9143-1
00:52:05.001 --> 00:52:06.377
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>a previous report. Um.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9183-0
00:52:07.737 --> 00:52:11.447
<v Hall, Emma 14831>At the moment we saved them down,
but in a central folder where we can a</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9183-1
00:52:11.447 --> 00:52:13.835
<v Hall, Emma 14831>ticket reference and everything.
So we've got,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9207-0
00:52:12.737 --> 00:52:16.620
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So you've got that, OK.
And is that something the system could</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9168-0
00:52:12.857 --> 00:52:13.097
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9183-2
00:52:13.835 --> 00:52:15.817
<v Hall, Emma 14831>we've got a copy of it somewhere, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9207-1
00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:20.442
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>help automate for us?
If we identify where that central place</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9207-2
00:52:20.442 --> 00:52:22.970
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>is,
can it do it once it's sent or do we</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9207-3
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:25.497
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>still have to take that as a manual step?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9218-0
00:52:28.177 --> 00:52:32.177
<v Josh Sparkes>You mean to send the the link to the
document out?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9231-0
00:52:33.377 --> 00:52:35.497
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>It could be.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9229-0
00:52:34.297 --> 00:52:35.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Automatically.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9255-0
00:52:34.577 --> 00:52:39.132
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>You'll save it first though, won't you?
Will you save it centralized first and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9247-0
00:52:37.617 --> 00:52:39.417
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah. And then, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9255-1
00:52:39.132 --> 00:52:42.937
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>then send it right? Forget it. Ignore me.
My brain's not working.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9245-0
00:52:39.657 --> 00:52:39.897
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9246-0
00:52:40.577 --> 00:52:41.057
<v Josh Sparkes>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9256-0
00:52:42.737 --> 00:52:45.057
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Unless there's a way to access the.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9280-0
00:52:46.017 --> 00:52:49.604
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>To have the document library copy to a
SharePoint folder somewhere or something</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9280-1
00:52:49.604 --> 00:52:51.577
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>like that.
I don't know if that's possible.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9337-0
00:52:50.657 --> 00:52:54.339
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I'm overcomplicating, Gordon,
just I'm not quite with it.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9283-0
00:52:52.697 --> 00:52:52.897
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9308-0
00:52:54.017 --> 00:52:59.897
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, I said. This is my first one.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9337-1
00:52:54.339 --> 00:52:59.226
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>It's the last one of our first workshops.
I'm just a little bit like, right,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9337-2
00:52:59.226 --> 00:53:02.654
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>sorry guys.
But so that sounds like we can purge them</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9337-3
00:53:02.654 --> 00:53:06.399
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>from the system then because you're
saving them centrally.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9337-4
00:53:06.399 --> 00:53:10.017
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So that's really the answer we needed.
Great. Thank you.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9325-0
00:53:08.417 --> 00:53:09.577
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9343-0
00:53:10.417 --> 00:53:13.057
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Do you when you go now? No, you go.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9381-0
00:53:10.897 --> 00:53:14.895
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Gordon, sorry, Wayne,
I I was just going to ask Gordon,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9381-1
00:53:14.895 --> 00:53:20.678
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>am I right in saying that macro enabled
documents or they're not able to be sent</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9381-2
00:53:20.678 --> 00:53:24.177
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>out from Sharewell or anything,
aren't they not?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9408-0
00:53:24.337 --> 00:53:27.756
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>I think did we get that changed? You know,
we changed it.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9387-0
00:53:26.097 --> 00:53:27.657
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah, I think.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9408-1
00:53:27.756 --> 00:53:30.467
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>We changed it for I managed links,
didn't we?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9404-0
00:53:29.537 --> 00:53:34.577
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Yeah, so the yeah, there's the.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9408-2
00:53:30.467 --> 00:53:33.297
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>So we could send I managed links macro
enabled.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9422-0
00:53:35.057 --> 00:53:39.857
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>I genuinely can't remember if we can do
that anymore. Can we do it?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9463-0
00:53:37.777 --> 00:53:42.142
<v Hall, Emma 14831>We can well that was the one remember
when we pressed the e-mail with I manage</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9428-0
00:53:41.337 --> 00:53:41.457
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>The.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9463-1
00:53:42.142 --> 00:53:46.618
<v Hall, Emma 14831>attachment it pops up as a normal e-mail
and I'm sure that we allowed us to send</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9463-2
00:53:46.618 --> 00:53:49.657
<v Hall, Emma 14831>macro enabled files.
That was our kind of work around.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9454-0
00:53:47.137 --> 00:53:49.097
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Yeah, So what?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9455-0
00:53:48.537 --> 00:53:49.217
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Uh, cool.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9523-0
00:53:50.257 --> 00:53:53.174
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Yeah.
So what happens just now is it's similar</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9523-1
00:53:53.174 --> 00:53:57.953
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>to I think what ask can ask client and
ask data management do sometimes when</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9523-2
00:53:57.953 --> 00:54:01.987
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>they're sending things out.
So basically for TQ IMAS perspective</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9523-3
00:54:01.987 --> 00:54:07.138
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>we've got like a an action and share well
underneath like the action list which is</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9523-4
00:54:07.138 --> 00:54:09.497
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>like generate CMI. So what happens is.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9577-0
00:54:10.137 --> 00:54:14.832
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>It kind of takes the team out of Cherwell
and Outlook window pops up and they</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9577-1
00:54:14.832 --> 00:54:19.648
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>basically send that e-mail from Outlook.
But because it's got the CMI number at</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9577-2
00:54:19.648 --> 00:54:22.658
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>the bottom,
it automatically like merges with the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9577-3
00:54:22.658 --> 00:54:26.510
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>case within Cherwell.
I was just wondering like will that be OK</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9577-4
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:28.617
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>from a ServiceNow perspective like.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9628-0
00:54:28.097 --> 00:54:30.713
<v Mark Sedge>I think we'd have to look at that,
you know,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9628-1
00:54:30.713 --> 00:54:34.318
<v Mark Sedge>unless Pari can shoot straight away and
say yes, it's doable.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9628-2
00:54:34.318 --> 00:54:38.968
<v Mark Sedge>But let me play back what I think you're
saying is that the point at which they</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9628-3
00:54:38.968 --> 00:54:43.794
<v Mark Sedge>want to you're looking to send the report
currently in Cherwell because you've got</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9628-4
00:54:43.794 --> 00:54:46.817
<v Mark Sedge>macros in those reports and what have you
and it's.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9634-0
00:54:50.617 --> 00:54:50.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9639-0
00:54:50.977 --> 00:54:51.417
Yeah.

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9692-0
00:54:50.977 --> 00:54:55.615
<v Mark Sedge>You you basically use the Outlook
generator to create to pop out a e-mail</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9692-1
00:54:55.615 --> 00:54:58.686
<v Mark Sedge>structure.
It pulls certain information from the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9657-0
00:54:57.217 --> 00:54:58.297
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9692-2
00:54:58.686 --> 00:55:01.444
<v Mark Sedge>record as it creates that e-mail
structure.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9692-3
00:55:01.444 --> 00:55:04.389
<v Mark Sedge>You drop the document in and then you
send it.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9692-4
00:55:04.389 --> 00:55:09.654
<v Mark Sedge>And am I right in saying that when you've
done that nothing is saved in Cherwell or</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9677-0
00:55:06.017 --> 00:55:06.537
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Mhm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9692-5
00:55:09.654 --> 00:55:10.657
<v Mark Sedge>is the document?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9696-0
00:55:10.777 --> 00:55:13.217
<v Mark Sedge>Itself still saved in Cherwell.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9717-0
00:55:15.137 --> 00:55:17.682
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>So the the e-mail will be saved as a
journal entry,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9701-0
00:55:15.537 --> 00:55:16.137
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Mm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9717-1
00:55:17.682 --> 00:55:19.737
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>but I don't think it saves the attachment.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9716-0
00:55:19.857 --> 00:55:20.297
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9762-0
00:55:20.577 --> 00:55:23.144
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>No,
just have the link in it in the body of</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9723-0
00:55:22.777 --> 00:55:23.017
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9762-1
00:55:23.144 --> 00:55:27.462
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>the journal because the problem is
Sharewell won't allow us to send macro</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9762-2
00:55:27.462 --> 00:55:30.963
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>enabled documents,
so that's why we have to save it outside</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9771-0
00:55:28.577 --> 00:55:34.114
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, just there's a couple of, yeah,
it's the usual couple of file extensions</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9743-0
00:55:28.737 --> 00:55:29.017
<v Hall, Emma 14831>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9762-3
00:55:30.963 --> 00:55:31.897
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>and send a link.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9756-0
00:55:33.097 --> 00:55:33.217
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9771-1
00:55:34.114 --> 00:55:36.777
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>that are that are banned from sending.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9808-0
00:55:34.977 --> 00:55:39.372
<v Mark Sedge>But in the interest of,
in the interest of sort of efficient,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9808-1
00:55:39.372 --> 00:55:42.917
<v Mark Sedge>not having heavy weighted emails slinging
around,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9808-2
00:55:42.917 --> 00:55:46.603
<v Mark Sedge>if you're saving something locally in an
open area,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9808-3
00:55:46.603 --> 00:55:50.857
<v Mark Sedge>would you not just send them the link and
get so that they?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9827-0
00:55:51.057 --> 00:55:56.697
<v Mark Sedge>Click the link from within there,
or do you always send the actual attached</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9847-0
00:55:56.257 --> 00:56:00.147
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, we don't. We don't have a,
we don't have a space really that we</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9827-1
00:55:56.697 --> 00:55:57.217
<v Mark Sedge>report?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9847-1
00:56:00.147 --> 00:56:04.537
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>could save those sort of things that all
our customers could access, you know?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9841-0
00:56:04.297 --> 00:56:04.417
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9850-0
00:56:06.817 --> 00:56:09.297
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>A lot of the stuff we might send.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9875-0
00:56:10.177 --> 00:56:14.247
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Particularly when it comes to
confidential matters are only for the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9875-1
00:56:14.247 --> 00:56:17.719
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>addressee only,
so we wouldn't want that being in an open</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9875-2
00:56:17.719 --> 00:56:18.377
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>area, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9897-0
00:56:17.777 --> 00:56:23.532
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, OK. OK, understood. Well,
we'll catch that as a requirement and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9881-0
00:56:21.337 --> 00:56:21.497
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9897-1
00:56:23.532 --> 00:56:25.177
<v Mark Sedge>then we'll work out.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9895-0
00:56:24.337 --> 00:56:25.057
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>I think.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9900-0
00:56:24.417 --> 00:56:27.497
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Is it the same challenge in service now,
Mark?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9927-0
00:56:26.737 --> 00:56:29.330
<v Mark Sedge>I'm I.
I was hoping Parek's going to jump in.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9927-1
00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:33.559
<v Mark Sedge>I've certainly not experienced it,
but I'll shut up and let Parek have the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9910-0
00:56:30.137 --> 00:56:30.257
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>But.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9988-0
00:56:32.897 --> 00:56:35.458
<v Parik Narain>I I would say it's not a technical
challenge.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9927-2
00:56:33.559 --> 00:56:33.897
<v Mark Sedge>floor.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9988-1
00:56:35.458 --> 00:56:39.355
<v Parik Narain>We just need to understand who should be
the audience for the report,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9988-2
00:56:39.355 --> 00:56:42.139
<v Parik Narain>where should it be stored.
And as I said earlier,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9988-3
00:56:42.139 --> 00:56:45.201
<v Parik Narain>using ServiceNow as a document store is
not advisable.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9988-4
00:56:45.201 --> 00:56:48.764
<v Parik Narain>If it's a report which is already built
in ServiceNow natively,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9988-5
00:56:48.764 --> 00:56:50.657
<v Parik Narain>it's easier to give people access.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10040-0
00:56:50.737 --> 00:56:54.714
<v Parik Narain>But if you want to have a format which is
stored as an attachment to a reporting</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/9996-0
00:56:54.417 --> 00:56:54.697
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Thanks.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10040-1
00:56:54.714 --> 00:56:57.906
<v Parik Narain>management kind of form,
then it becomes a bit a bit challenging</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10040-2
00:56:57.906 --> 00:57:00.459
<v Parik Narain>because externals don't have access to
this anyway.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10040-3
00:57:00.459 --> 00:57:04.191
<v Parik Narain>But we need to manage it somehow so that
you can expose it to the audience.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10022-0
00:57:04.057 --> 00:57:04.137
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10040-4
00:57:04.191 --> 00:57:07.382
<v Parik Narain>So let us take it back.
We'll check what's the best solution and</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10040-5
00:57:07.382 --> 00:57:08.217
<v Parik Narain>come back to you.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10061-0
00:57:08.857 --> 00:57:11.312
<v Parik Narain>But technically it's not a problem.
We just want to.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10033-0
00:57:09.097 --> 00:57:09.177
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10061-1
00:57:11.312 --> 00:57:15.158
<v Parik Narain>I just want to understand some interplays
between various personas and the and the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10056-0
00:57:14.897 --> 00:57:16.737
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah, I think the biggest.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10061-2
00:57:15.158 --> 00:57:17.057
<v Parik Narain>people who want to see it and the format.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10134-0
00:57:15.937 --> 00:57:18.344
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>OK,
I just want to make sure that we're</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10134-1
00:57:18.344 --> 00:57:23.219
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>talking about the same challenge here.
I don't think it's about where that macro</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10073-0
00:57:20.777 --> 00:57:20.937
<v Parik Narain>Mm.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10134-2
00:57:23.219 --> 00:57:27.191
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>enabled documents saved.
It's more about how we send that because</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10134-3
00:57:27.191 --> 00:57:32.187
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>and Gordon mail correct me if I'm wrong,
but I don't know the tech reasons for it,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10089-0
00:57:27.497 --> 00:57:27.697
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10134-4
00:57:32.187 --> 00:57:35.076
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>right?
But Share will won't allow us to send an</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10119-0
00:57:32.897 --> 00:57:35.177
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>It's it's the failure, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10134-5
00:57:35.076 --> 00:57:35.497
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>actual.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10148-0
00:57:35.737 --> 00:57:39.574
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>File that's got macros in it.
So if that's not an issue in ServiceNow,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10140-0
00:57:36.697 --> 00:57:39.497
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>It's the file extension, so.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10128-0
00:57:36.897 --> 00:57:37.017
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10148-1
00:57:39.574 --> 00:57:40.817
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>then it's not an issue.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10194-0
00:57:40.737 --> 00:57:43.238
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Yeah,
there's certain file extensions that</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10194-1
00:57:43.238 --> 00:57:46.496
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>aren't allowed.
I manage attachments being one of them.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10194-2
00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:50.335
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>XLSM documents or macro enabled Excel
files, they're not allowed.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10194-3
00:57:50.335 --> 00:57:54.058
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>So that's the problem.
We can't send those file extensions from</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10194-4
00:57:54.058 --> 00:57:56.792
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Cherwell,
so we have to work around it and use</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10194-5
00:57:56.792 --> 00:57:57.257
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>Outlook.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10190-0
00:57:57.857 --> 00:57:58.537
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>So.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10196-0
00:57:57.857 --> 00:58:01.857
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So can we send XLSM documents through
ServiceNow?</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10253-0
00:58:01.217 --> 00:58:05.889
<v Parik Narain>So sometimes macros are blocked by
security anyway because you're you are</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10253-1
00:58:05.889 --> 00:58:09.047
<v Parik Narain>your SAS platform,
the platform will send it out.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10253-2
00:58:09.047 --> 00:58:14.161
<v Parik Narain>So either even if you allow from service
now it could be that destination blocks</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10220-0
00:58:10.937 --> 00:58:11.057
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10301-0
00:58:13.937 --> 00:58:16.685
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So it's maybe still a OK,
I get you Paddock.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10253-3
00:58:14.161 --> 00:58:17.697
<v Parik Narain>it because it's got macros in there.
So you'll have to.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10246-0
00:58:15.857 --> 00:58:17.297
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Yeah, so I.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10301-1
00:58:16.685 --> 00:58:21.692
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So it's maybe still us that's blocking
that from our security kind of things. OK,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10248-0
00:58:17.857 --> 00:58:17.977
<v Hall, Emma 14831>OK.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10256-0
00:58:17.977 --> 00:58:19.137
<v Parik Narain>Address that.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10257-0
00:58:20.537 --> 00:58:20.857
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10263-0
00:58:21.417 --> 00:58:22.137
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10301-2
00:58:21.692 --> 00:58:24.379
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>yeah.
So that's something just to consider.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10301-3
00:58:24.379 --> 00:58:27.737
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Then we will need to find a workaround
for that, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10268-0
00:58:24.457 --> 00:58:24.697
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10289-0
00:58:26.257 --> 00:58:28.697
<v Parik Narain>We'll keep a note and we'll see.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10293-0
00:58:27.097 --> 00:58:29.257
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>We could, yeah, yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10358-0
00:58:27.857 --> 00:58:32.001
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>I was going to say that it's, yeah,
I don't believe it's a Sharewell thing.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10358-1
00:58:32.001 --> 00:58:35.981
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>I believe it's an Asher thing that blocks

00:58:35.981 --> 00:58:40.288
<v Wilson, Mel 14628>I think I've got a list of the file types
that Sharewell accepts or it doesn't</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10358-3
00:58:40.288 --> 00:58:43.941

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10376-0
00:58:42.417 --> 00:58:46.899
<v Middleton, Gordon 14755>So it's funny that it would block,

00:59:20.339 --> 00:59:25.538
<v Josh Sparkes>clarify we've got it, got it right.
But we'll be in touch about user stories</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10467-3
00:59:25.538 --> 00:59:30.737
<v Josh Sparkes>and you'll have a have a view there as

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10498-0
00:59:31.497 --> 00:59:35.206

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10498-1
00:59:35.206 --> 00:59:40.733
<v Josh Sparkes>I know for some good things come up
organically, but open to anything else,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10481-0
00:59:37.137 --> 00:59:37.577
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>They.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10487-0
00:59:38.497 --> 00:59:39.017
<v Hall, Emma 14831>No.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10554-0
00:59:38.977 --> 00:59:42.373
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>Very last thing for me, Josh,
it's just on back to those scheduled</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10498-2
00:59:40.733 --> 00:59:41.097
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10554-1
00:59:42.373 --> 00:59:46.328
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>cases that the team handle each of them
or depending on the complexity of it,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10554-2
00:59:46.328 --> 00:59:50.130
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>but each of them will probably work
instruction associated with it just in</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10554-3
00:59:50.130 --> 00:59:52.462
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>terms of how to actually complete the
report.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10554-4
00:59:52.462 --> 00:59:54.996
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>So just making sure probably a knowledge
article,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10554-5
00:59:54.996 --> 00:59:58.697
<v Tant, Wayne 14530>but making sure those scheduled cases can
then link into that knowledge.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10542-0
00:59:56.577 --> 00:59:57.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10561-0
00:59:59.697 --> 01:00:03.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep, if it's a step one by Mark, sorry.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10615-0
01:00:00.737 --> 01:00:04.203
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, I was just going to say, Wayne,
what what you know,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10615-1
01:00:04.203 --> 01:00:06.892
<v Mark Sedge>what I've seen in the past is the,
you know,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10615-2
01:00:06.892 --> 01:00:10.836
<v Mark Sedge>like the knowledge articles triggered by
the title of the report.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10615-3
01:00:10.836 --> 01:00:14.003
<v Mark Sedge>So as soon as they soon as they sort of
start on it,</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10615-4
01:00:14.003 --> 01:00:18.665
<v Mark Sedge>there's a there's a reference to the
knowledge article and a link straight to</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10615-5
01:00:18.665 --> 01:00:20.577
<v Mark Sedge>it so they can tap into it view.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10623-0
01:00:20.657 --> 01:00:24.937
<v Mark Sedge>Come out of it, action, etcetera.
So we'd look to make that really slick.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10625-0
01:00:24.817 --> 01:00:26.137

<v Josh Sparkes>Nice. Yeah,
I think we can add a lot of value here</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10665-1
01:00:30.286 --> 01:00:35.470
<v Josh Sparkes>with with what we've just spoken through.
Sounds like we could mature the the</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10665-2
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:40.588
<v Josh Sparkes>system quite a lot. Cool. All right.
If that's it then, then happy to close.</v>

d973ffc4-4804-40ff-b14f-4e7b887585a0/10665-3

01:00:52.417 --> 01:00:54.577
