<v Josh Sparkes>I didn't realize you weren't.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27070-0
00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:10.414
<v Josh Sparkes>I had thought last week that you were
moving it or it moved as people spoke.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27070-1
00:17:10.414 --> 00:17:16.300
<v Josh Sparkes>It needs to be controlled,
so we have shut solid tail down.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27110-0
00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:22.737
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm getting control. All right. Yeah.
Should we get into invoices?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27110-1
00:17:22.737 --> 00:17:28.251
<v Josh Sparkes>We still have a couple of things to do
after a bit of prioritization,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27110-2
00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:34.315
<v Josh Sparkes>but it should be simple and quick.
Quick look at some recommended dashboards</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27110-3
00:17:34.315 --> 00:17:35.260
<v Josh Sparkes>and reports.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27142-0
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:41.313
<v Josh Sparkes>Sports again, that's nothing to to tax in.
So this is probably the the last real</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27142-1
00:17:41.313 --> 00:17:45.692
<v Josh Sparkes>chunk of bulky bulky deep dive stuff.
So yeah, when we go,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27142-2
00:17:45.692 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Josh Sparkes>it's quite a heavy lift in here.
It's quite a few processes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27173-0
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.655
<v Josh Sparkes>Deborah,
I know you wanted to try and consolidate</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27173-1
00:17:54.655 --> 00:17:59.346
<v Josh Sparkes>these quite a lot.
So so I had a look at your as in this</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27173-2
00:17:59.346 --> 00:18:04.860
<v Josh Sparkes>world today and there was a lot of upload
invoice, upload invoice.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27208-0
00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:11.939
<v Josh Sparkes>Localisations value over 100,
000 and so as a service we recommend that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27208-1
00:18:11.939 --> 00:18:17.004
<v Josh Sparkes>may become one service like managing
voices essentially.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27208-2
00:18:17.004 --> 00:18:22.780
<v Josh Sparkes>And again that's not to trivialise every
scenario that comes in.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27245-0
00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.956
<v Josh Sparkes>But that was from analysing what you do
to date,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27245-1
00:18:27.956 --> 00:18:33.591
<v Josh Sparkes>sort of where I landed as a service and
maybe as we talk through that that you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27245-2
00:18:33.591 --> 00:18:38.940
<v Josh Sparkes>agree with so that you get this.
So within that service you can get a new.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27288-0
00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:44.221
<v Josh Sparkes>You can administrate it, control it.
Maybe there's a rejection process.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27288-1
00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:48.475
<v Josh Sparkes>I thought if we can go through that
because there was like portal</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27288-2
00:18:48.475 --> 00:18:52.342
<v Josh Sparkes>subscription fee, it's still an invoice.
Now you might say,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27288-3
00:18:52.342 --> 00:18:56.854
<v Josh Sparkes>well actually that's slightly different,
that's outside of the scope,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27288-4
00:18:56.854 --> 00:18:58.980
<v Josh Sparkes>but it is a consolidated manager.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27329-0
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.810
<v Josh Sparkes>Invoice service.
So maybe start from the is that is that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27329-1
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:07.514
<v Josh Sparkes>good to as a good landing point and that
again when I had seen it for</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27329-2
00:19:07.514 --> 00:19:12.822
<v Josh Sparkes>localisations I sort of challenged back
to actually that they seemed it seemed</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27329-3
00:19:12.822 --> 00:19:15.980
<v Josh Sparkes>very globalised service that we could
provide.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27359-0
00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:20.467
<v Josh Sparkes>And you know,
maybe that you have again from your skill</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27359-1
00:19:20.467 --> 00:19:26.207
<v Josh Sparkes>matrix or location of that request,
there could be some auto assignment in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27344-0
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.260
Yeah.

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27359-2
00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:32.100
<v Josh Sparkes>place that goes to use in, you know,
depending on team members which can be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27366-0
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:36.660
<v Josh Sparkes>um changed accordingly or reassigned to
if you need to do that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27371-0
00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.820
<v Josh Sparkes>But that's something you can start with.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27427-0
00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.465
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean I called it uploads.
So you've got invoice management.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27427-1
00:19:48.465 --> 00:19:53.074
<v Josh Sparkes>So soon you get a new invoice that comes
in. Is that a fair?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27427-2
00:19:53.074 --> 00:19:59.194
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes to start with and then you could have
the entry criteria or dependency where</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27427-3
00:19:59.194 --> 00:20:03.500
<v Josh Sparkes>you've already on board with the clients
they're active.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27472-0
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:08.391
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's the point that's that's sort
of happy path presumably of that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27472-1
00:20:08.391 --> 00:20:13.588
<v Josh Sparkes>So it would look up that you know the the
service could look up the fact that the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27472-2
00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:18.532
<v Josh Sparkes>client's already in place, they're active,
they're not deactivated or longer.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27472-3
00:20:18.532 --> 00:20:20.940
<v Josh Sparkes>So we're not getting invoices equally.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27500-0
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:27.537
<v Josh Sparkes>That are for previously deactivated
company. So there's that check.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27500-1
00:20:27.537 --> 00:20:34.563
<v Josh Sparkes>So the requester could upload the invoice,
then send it and then you would receive</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27500-2
00:20:34.563 --> 00:20:37.780
<v Josh Sparkes>it as a group. So is that fair to say?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27535-0
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:44.908
<v Josh Sparkes>And then is that and then I think that's
probably and then from that process you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27535-1
00:20:44.908 --> 00:20:51.520
<v Josh Sparkes>would then be processing the invoice.
Now I've made it sound as if it's one</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27535-2
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.260
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice, one client.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27582-0
00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:59.644
<v Josh Sparkes>But maybe the person is submitting one
client, multiple invoices,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27544-0
00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.300
<v Max Trickett>Mhm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27582-1
00:20:59.644 --> 00:21:06.574
<v Josh Sparkes>multiple clients, multiple invoices.
Is that better to say that they just use</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27582-2
00:21:06.574 --> 00:21:12.260
<v Josh Sparkes>it all? Normally it will be no batch race,
but it will be like.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27626-0
00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.872
<v Josh Sparkes>So overall,
it could be their partners worked on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27626-1
00:21:15.872 --> 00:21:21.179
<v Josh Sparkes>online and they'll send it over.
It really depends on who's setting the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27626-2
00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:24.717
<v Josh Sparkes>request. OK,
and the service could handle that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27626-3
00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:29.877
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be that each task and this is
probably where you'll come in,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27626-4
00:21:29.877 --> 00:21:31.940
<v Josh Sparkes>but essentially you'll have.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27663-0
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:36.549
<v Josh Sparkes>Some parent information limited for and
then each task will be this for this</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27663-1
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:40.200
<v Josh Sparkes>client attachments.
Those clients maybe you enter the value,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27663-2
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.869
<v Josh Sparkes>they enter the value that's over 100,
000 or they actually enter the value of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27663-3
00:21:44.869 --> 00:21:48.220
<v Josh Sparkes>the invoice.
Then you've got some reconciliation there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27713-0
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.645
<v Josh Sparkes>And they can add whilst they're in that
request, add another, add another,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27713-1
00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:57.292
<v Josh Sparkes>add another.
And you've got that clear association of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27713-2
00:21:57.292 --> 00:22:02.357
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice related to clients rather than
having to scroll through the e-mail</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27713-3
00:22:02.357 --> 00:22:05.532
<v Josh Sparkes>attachments which will say invoice one or
PDF,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27713-4
00:22:05.532 --> 00:22:08.300
<v Josh Sparkes>you know that naming convention that you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27749-0
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.578
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably isn't there and you can download
them from there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27749-1
00:22:12.578 --> 00:22:17.968
<v Josh Sparkes>And I know a feature probably that I see
in your pain point is having to download</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27749-2
00:22:17.968 --> 00:22:21.846
<v Josh Sparkes>them one by one,
whereas there's a service of download all</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27749-3
00:22:21.846 --> 00:22:24.540
<v Josh Sparkes>that is available as well as the service.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27756-0
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:30.980
<v Josh Sparkes>Because what we find is there is actually
multiple units into one request.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27817-0
00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.169
<v Josh Sparkes>We upload per client,
so it could end up in two different</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27817-1
00:22:35.169 --> 00:22:39.117
<v Josh Sparkes>people. So like, right,
they'll do that one and then it goes into</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27817-2
00:22:39.117 --> 00:22:42.705
<v Josh Sparkes>the mix because that we just upload one
client per request.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27817-3
00:22:42.705 --> 00:22:46.354
<v Josh Sparkes>You would prefer the rules to be one
client per request, OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27817-4
00:22:46.354 --> 00:22:50.540
<v Josh Sparkes>as a rule rather than multiple clients
and multiple invoices, OK, so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27852-0
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.704
<v Josh Sparkes>The request can still have like the 10:15
where invoice is on there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27852-1
00:22:55.704 --> 00:22:58.533
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's just the one line it doesn't just
OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27852-2
00:22:58.533 --> 00:23:03.145
<v Josh Sparkes>that's that's because we want to capture
111 invoice and multiple invoice,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27852-3
00:23:03.145 --> 00:23:07.819
<v Josh Sparkes>but the line has to be the same. OK,
so what I can see is like this request</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27852-4
00:23:07.819 --> 00:23:10.340
<v Josh Sparkes>will be like client name invoice numbers.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27901-0
00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.637
<v Josh Sparkes>Value.
We'd like to take some of that and like</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27901-1
00:23:14.637 --> 00:23:18.571
<v Josh Sparkes>partnering.
So take care of a little bit special.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27901-2
00:23:18.571 --> 00:23:24.863
<v Josh Sparkes>That would be a really good indicator to
see because at the moment we don't see</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27901-3
00:23:24.863 --> 00:23:28.560
<v Josh Sparkes>that.
We see upgraded invoice and then we have</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27901-4
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.740
<v Josh Sparkes>to go into the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27931-0
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:34.047
<v Josh Sparkes>There's some priority in there.
So you've got over 100,000,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27931-1
00:23:34.047 --> 00:23:38.097
<v Josh Sparkes>that's value that could be in either
currency, yeah, any currency.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27931-2
00:23:38.097 --> 00:23:43.053
<v Josh Sparkes>So I suppose all it'll be tick and would
you want the value so that you can refer</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27931-3
00:23:43.053 --> 00:23:46.740
<v Josh Sparkes>to so they actually you're marking
against, yeah, I suppose.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27932-0
00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:47.780
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27975-0
00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:56.681
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean I suppose the reason why I've
mentioned that as a service like you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27975-1
00:23:56.681 --> 00:24:02.921
<v Josh Sparkes>could say like if if it's recurring that
everyone time and materials or billing,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/27975-2
00:24:02.921 --> 00:24:07.620
<v Josh Sparkes>you know you're expecting this recurring
invoices coming in.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28011-0
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:12.409
<v Josh Sparkes>Suddenly on the dashboard there's this
bullet that last market was 80K and you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28011-1
00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:17.189
<v Josh Sparkes>get this sort of reporting that there's a
spike in the in the value on that client</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28011-2
00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:20.298
<v Josh Sparkes>for example,
and you can sort of see the anomalies on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28011-3
00:24:20.298 --> 00:24:23.580
<v Josh Sparkes>the dashboard if a value is entered up by
the requester.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28043-0
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:29.379
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah,
we have to have like a matter ID or a PO</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28043-1
00:24:29.379 --> 00:24:35.295
<v Josh Sparkes>number one that's like mandatory.
We don't have that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28043-2
00:24:35.295 --> 00:24:39.020
<v Josh Sparkes>We can't get the invoice I saw on.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28079-0
00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.103
<v Josh Sparkes>E someone billing that they have invoices,
non PO.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28079-1
00:24:44.103 --> 00:24:47.419
<v Josh Sparkes>Are you saying you have invoices or PO?
OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28079-2
00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:53.221
<v Josh Sparkes>so that would be a mandatory field
because most of the time you just get PEF</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28079-3
00:24:53.221 --> 00:24:55.180
<v Josh Sparkes>and you can't do anything.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28112-0
00:24:55.380 --> 00:25:02.547
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, so it's not that. So all PO. Yep. Yep.
And so it's PO. It's PO different clients.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28112-1
00:25:02.547 --> 00:25:08.214
<v Josh Sparkes>It's different. So like a matter ID.
Climb, matter reference. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28112-2
00:25:08.214 --> 00:25:12.380
<v Josh Sparkes>So we need to figure out what we want to
land on.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28157-0
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.244
<v Josh Sparkes>So would you have?
So would you have reference and then if</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28157-1
00:25:16.244 --> 00:25:20.392
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a client e-billing reference,
you have a drop down or you just prefer</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28157-2
00:25:20.392 --> 00:25:25.037
<v Josh Sparkes>it to be client e-billing reference? Yeah,
and then it would be like a free text in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28157-3
00:25:25.037 --> 00:25:29.296
<v Josh Sparkes>because it doesn't follow suit each
client. There's no formatting. No. Well,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28157-4
00:25:29.296 --> 00:25:32.780
<v Josh Sparkes>it depends on the client somewhere,
alphanumeric some numeric.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28174-0
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.536
<v Josh Sparkes>Would they be able to submit that request
if it's eBay?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28174-1
00:25:40.536 --> 00:25:42.820
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be like managing bureau.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28208-0
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:47.142
<v Josh Sparkes>It can be a mandatory, but it can.
I mean either. Yes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28208-1
00:25:47.142 --> 00:25:51.852
<v Josh Sparkes>if you need it to be mandatory because
without it you're preventing you being</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28208-2
00:25:51.852 --> 00:25:55.234
<v Josh Sparkes>downstream, you can't do anything,
then it needs to be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28208-3
00:25:55.234 --> 00:25:59.340
<v Josh Sparkes>And I'd recommend as part of that service
you have it as mandatory.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28266-0
00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.069
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
because at the moment it doesn't come</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28266-1
00:26:02.069 --> 00:26:06.056
<v Josh Sparkes>through as mandatory sources on our stats
because we can't do that. We can't.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28266-2
00:26:06.056 --> 00:26:09.736
<v Josh Sparkes>We just can't progress it. Yeah,
we can't progress it until we have any</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28266-3
00:26:09.736 --> 00:26:13.416
<v Josh Sparkes>information. We can't upload it.
So it just adds and adds on our, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28266-4
00:26:13.416 --> 00:26:17.709
<v Josh Sparkes>thinking stats because it can take like a
week together. It can take a month. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28266-5
00:26:17.709 --> 00:26:19.140
<v Josh Sparkes>So if they don't send it to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28257-0
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:18.700
<v Mark Sedgey>This.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28295-0
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.111
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
and they can mark what I'm on at the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28295-1
00:26:22.111 --> 00:26:25.405
<v Josh Sparkes>requester level you can they can save as
drafts.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28295-2
00:26:25.405 --> 00:26:30.379
<v Josh Sparkes>So if they submit a certain amount,
they can save as a draft that sits in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28295-3
00:26:30.379 --> 00:26:33.740
<v Josh Sparkes>their task list that they needed to
provide them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28348-0
00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.733
<v Mark Sedgey>Well, Parik,
I was going to ask Parikh on that point,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28348-1
00:26:39.733 --> 00:26:42.821
<v Mark Sedgey>whether we could do,
whether there's a way of doing a,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28348-2
00:26:42.821 --> 00:26:45.685
<v Mark Sedgey>you know,
so I think it's what level of submission</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28348-3
00:26:45.685 --> 00:26:50.177
<v Mark Sedgey>you get to for them to save it because
you don't want them to have a whole load</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28348-4
00:26:50.177 --> 00:26:54.500
<v Mark Sedgey>with just say a name in it sitting there.
It's at what point and how do you?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28407-0
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.950
<v Mark Sedgey>You know what,
what's the mandatory stuff to enable you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28407-1
00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:02.122
<v Mark Sedgey>to save it and then add to it.
I think that's the that will be the key</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28407-2
00:27:02.122 --> 00:27:06.880
<v Mark Sedgey>thing because you could do, you could,
you could have a certain amount of fields</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28407-3
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.524
<v Mark Sedgey>just say what we do with the change
process.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28407-4
00:27:09.524 --> 00:27:13.460
<v Mark Sedgey>You have a certain amount to get that you
know that record raised.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28447-0
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.834
<v Mark Sedgey>And then you have a number of other items
that they once it's saved,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28447-1
00:27:17.834 --> 00:27:21.809
<v Mark Sedgey>they then add to it before they submit it.
So and again, if Parik,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28447-2
00:27:21.809 --> 00:27:25.784
<v Mark Sedgey>I don't know if you're on the call,
is that something that we can,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28432-0
00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.020
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, I I'm here. I I'm here.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28447-3
00:27:25.784 --> 00:27:27.860
<v Mark Sedgey>is that something we could do here?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28478-0
00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.647
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
That's absolutely, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28478-1
00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:30.985
<v Parik Narain>that's a standard process. So yeah,
that's fine.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28478-2
00:27:30.985 --> 00:27:34.469
<v Parik Narain>We can look at the fields and the
information gathered and anything else</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28453-0
00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:31.980
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28458-0
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:33.820
OK.

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28478-3
00:27:34.469 --> 00:27:38.382
<v Parik Narain>which is auxiliary to that and then make
sure that's available before submission,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28478-4
00:27:38.382 --> 00:27:38.620
<v Parik Narain>yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28536-0
00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.105
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, so, so we got,
we could almost have two, two pieces.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28536-1
00:27:42.105 --> 00:27:45.315
<v Mark Sedgey>You've got it,
you've got the mandatory information to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28536-2
00:27:45.315 --> 00:27:49.518
<v Mark Sedgey>enable you to save the record and then
complete you know certain items.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28536-3
00:27:49.518 --> 00:27:52.670
<v Mark Sedgey>Once it's saved,
you can then instate up post saving.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28536-4
00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.881
<v Mark Sedgey>These are the mandatory information
before submission.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28509-0
00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:53.420
<v Parik Narain>Right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28536-5
00:27:55.881 --> 00:27:57.340
<v Mark Sedgey>So you kind of have that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28572-0
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:03.023
<v Mark Sedgey>That two-step process.
The one thing that I was just about to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28532-0
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:00.980
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28572-1
00:28:03.023 --> 00:28:08.858
<v Mark Sedgey>ask on that preferred free text statement
is your the e-billing the the sort of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28572-2
00:28:08.858 --> 00:28:12.505
<v Mark Sedgey>reference number that you want as that
free text.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28572-3
00:28:12.505 --> 00:28:15.860
<v Mark Sedgey>Do you want to put any controls in that
cell?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28604-0
00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:20.389
<v Mark Sedgey>The innate that sort of derives for the
right content because what you don't want</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28579-0
00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28604-1
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:23.426
<v Mark Sedgey>to do is have it free text and if someone
doesn't know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28604-2
00:28:23.426 --> 00:28:27.820
<v Mark Sedgey>they just put don't know and then submit
it and then you go back round the loop.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28619-0
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:35.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it's like a blacklist.
We want TBC and then JC.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28678-0
00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.810
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah,
so you or or you structure it if you've</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28678-1
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.108
<v Mark Sedgey>got,
say you've got an E billing number that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28678-2
00:28:38.108 --> 00:28:41.224
<v Mark Sedgey>you're that needs,
you know it's 16 digit number with a E on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28678-3
00:28:41.224 --> 00:28:45.055
<v Mark Sedgey>the front of it or whatever it is.
You can define some of the rules to say</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28678-4
00:28:45.055 --> 00:28:48.937
<v Mark Sedgey>look out for this number and if it
doesn't contain this number then you you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28678-5
00:28:48.937 --> 00:28:52.870
<v Mark Sedgey>put an error code to the person to say
we're looking for this number to look</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28678-6
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:53.380
<v Mark Sedgey>like this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28679-0
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:54.460
<v Mark Sedgey>Or whatever.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28723-0
00:28:55.540 --> 00:29:01.193
<v Josh Sparkes>That's too much. Yeah,
we've got 400 plus clients and then we've</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28698-0
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:06.180
<v Mark Sedgey>Forget that idea then. Forget that. Yeah,
understood.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28723-1
00:29:01.193 --> 00:29:06.324
<v Josh Sparkes>got different. Yeah,
numbers that can be numeric combined.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28723-2
00:29:06.324 --> 00:29:12.411
<v Josh Sparkes>I was going to say different clients use
different reference numbers.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28702-0
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:10.860
<v Mark Sedgey>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28704-0
00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:11.260
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28723-3
00:29:12.411 --> 00:29:15.020
<v Josh Sparkes>There's going to be difficult.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28711-0
00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:12.700
<v Parik Narain>The.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28766-0
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:21.014
<v Josh Sparkes>Text that you say unknown or TVC objects.
Yeah, you can do that. I mean,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28766-1
00:29:21.014 --> 00:29:26.030
<v Josh Sparkes>it's customized. It's customization.
We can't do that. You know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28744-0
00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.100
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28766-2
00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:30.660
<v Josh Sparkes>you have descriptive to say do not allow
TVC, NA, etcetera.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28756-0
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.220
<v Parik Narain>The only point is.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28821-0
00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:36.683
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, Julian, the only point is,
you know the validation we were talking</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28770-0
00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:34.780
<v Josh Sparkes>Let's say that one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28821-1
00:29:36.683 --> 00:29:39.168
<v Parik Narain>about,
it's only useful if the information is as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28821-2
00:29:39.168 --> 00:29:43.378
<v Parik Narain>less free text as possible because people
can just put dot or dash or ABC in there</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28784-0
00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:40.420
<v Josh Sparkes>The system.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28821-3
00:29:43.378 --> 00:29:47.588
<v Parik Narain>as you say or TBC in there and carry on
because it's not used to useful otherwise.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28821-4
00:29:47.588 --> 00:29:50.580
<v Parik Narain>So what we'll have to see is things we
may make mandatory.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28857-0
00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:54.966
<v Parik Narain>They are made mandatory and you're not
able to bypass that without putting the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28857-1
00:29:54.966 --> 00:29:57.590
<v Parik Narain>right detail.
Otherwise that's it's it's of no use,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28857-2
00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:01.323
<v Parik Narain>you know that development work.
So that's that's the only point I want to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28880-0
00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:06.848
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it sounds good. Yeah,
it's it's that client votes that be whole</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28857-3
00:30:01.323 --> 00:30:05.107
<v Parik Narain>make. We can always discuss later.
We can always discuss later what what's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28857-4
00:30:05.107 --> 00:30:05.460
<v Parik Narain>needed.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28880-1
00:30:06.848 --> 00:30:11.028
<v Josh Sparkes>products.
You've been so dependent on the client as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28880-2
00:30:11.028 --> 00:30:15.852
<v Josh Sparkes>well because they may change their own
formats and impacts.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28880-3
00:30:15.852 --> 00:30:17.620
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's it's probably.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28916-0
00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.419
<v Josh Sparkes>I would say wasted effort and value.
It's just that it's short term.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28916-1
00:30:22.419 --> 00:30:26.282
<v Josh Sparkes>You won't get a long term.
It comes back to probably Lynn to your</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28916-2
00:30:26.282 --> 00:30:28.858
<v Josh Sparkes>point of the value to change either
habits.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28916-3
00:30:28.858 --> 00:30:33.540
<v Josh Sparkes>You know you can pull those insights of
who are the people that always put TBC.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28969-0
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.432
<v Josh Sparkes>It was consistent, you know, behavioural,
yes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28969-1
00:30:36.432 --> 00:30:39.082
<v Josh Sparkes>that you can grab based on the question.
Exactly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28969-2
00:30:39.082 --> 00:30:42.845
<v Josh Sparkes>I can say it might be worth just almost
go live with the kind of open,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28969-3
00:30:42.845 --> 00:30:45.707
<v Josh Sparkes>but allow them to put their own reference
numbers in,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28969-4
00:30:45.707 --> 00:30:49.735
<v Josh Sparkes>then start to look at behaviours and
patterns and then look at your reports</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28969-5
00:30:49.735 --> 00:30:51.060
<v Josh Sparkes>and dashboards and go OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28983-0
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.514
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
we've seen a lot of this and then we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28983-1
00:30:54.514 --> 00:30:58.224
<v Josh Sparkes>might look at, OK, OK,
let's put in some blockers on TVC, NA,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/28983-2
00:30:58.224 --> 00:30:59.420
<v Josh Sparkes>dot, dot, et cetera.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29019-0
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:05.770
<v Josh Sparkes>Because you're giving them pointers to,
you know you can have a recommended field</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29019-1
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.032
<v Josh Sparkes>that they and you know even the standard
pop-ups.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29019-2
00:31:09.032 --> 00:31:14.250
<v Josh Sparkes>Have you completed this correctly that
you're getting them to confirm that it's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29019-3
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.620
<v Josh Sparkes>sort of driving that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29055-0
00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:21.077
<v Josh Sparkes>Behaviour without, as you said,
mandatory boxing. The need is noted. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29055-1
00:31:21.077 --> 00:31:26.057
<v Josh Sparkes>can I just check something?
So you mentioned for each of the requests</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29055-2
00:31:26.057 --> 00:31:31.820
<v Josh Sparkes>you'd like one client can have multiple
invoices and then you mentioned as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29088-0
00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:38.566
<v Josh Sparkes>You'd like the matter ID or purchase
order number. Is that per invoice?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29088-1
00:31:38.566 --> 00:31:43.259
<v Josh Sparkes>You'd have to maybe a different matter
number. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29088-2
00:31:43.259 --> 00:31:48.228
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a reference on each of the
attachments. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29071-0
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:45.140
<v Mark Sedgey>Oh.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29088-3
00:31:48.228 --> 00:31:51.540
<v Josh Sparkes>you could actually say same for all.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29120-0
00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.036
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.
And it's saying for it can just be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29120-1
00:31:54.036 --> 00:31:57.175
<v Josh Sparkes>entered once. Yeah, that's a good point.
Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29120-2
00:31:57.175 --> 00:32:02.126
<v Josh Sparkes>Imagine that client maybe you'd want to
have as a drop down to avoid that kind of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29120-3
00:32:02.126 --> 00:32:07.017
<v Josh Sparkes>human behavioural, you know, various.
Well, that was my kind of second question,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29120-4
00:32:07.017 --> 00:32:07.620
<v Josh Sparkes>which was.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29154-0
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.727
<v Josh Sparkes>If we wanted to drop down with the client
names,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29154-1
00:32:11.727 --> 00:32:16.994
<v Josh Sparkes>is there a way that the client onboarding
process, oh amazing, I was going to,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29154-2
00:32:16.994 --> 00:32:22.127
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just going to go back to that is
client active and that's why we started</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29154-3
00:32:22.127 --> 00:32:23.660
<v Josh Sparkes>with client onboarding.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29176-0
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.486
<v Josh Sparkes>When we're discussing it as a team that
you've got the the active,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29176-1
00:32:28.486 --> 00:32:33.068
<v Josh Sparkes>you should do that dynamically updated
options in the drop down list.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29176-2
00:32:33.068 --> 00:32:34.180
<v Josh Sparkes>I think they can.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29237-0
00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:40.653
<v Josh Sparkes>I just want to make sure that we've got a
trusted source for that company data as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29237-1
00:32:40.653 --> 00:32:43.956
<v Josh Sparkes>well and and those will be triggered by
the client on boarding,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29237-2
00:32:43.956 --> 00:32:47.930
<v Josh Sparkes>but then once it's in and governed and
then it feeds into other process like</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29237-3
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.956
<v Josh Sparkes>this particular service here as well.
So we can do that and it can be OK if I</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29237-4
00:32:51.956 --> 00:32:52.420
<v Josh Sparkes>select a.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29292-0
00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.904
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we used government maybe used
before like JP Morgan or maybe on the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29292-1
00:32:55.904 --> 00:32:59.570
<v Josh Sparkes>other banks as well and then there'll be
some information that needs to capture</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29292-2
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.641
<v Josh Sparkes>about them as well that can be dynamic
and differentiated as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29292-3
00:33:02.641 --> 00:33:06.079
<v Josh Sparkes>But we just need to make sure that that
source is trusted in terms of that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29292-4
00:33:06.079 --> 00:33:08.325
<v Josh Sparkes>company data as well. Yeah,
I mean you can have,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29292-5
00:33:08.325 --> 00:33:10.020
<v Josh Sparkes>but I think you were talking earlier.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29344-0
00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:16.112
<v Josh Sparkes>Your onboarding goes to the parents.
Do you have invoices for subsidiaries</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29344-1
00:33:16.112 --> 00:33:22.013
<v Josh Sparkes>that sort of you know that and then I
think vendor onboarding also there was an</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29344-2
00:33:22.013 --> 00:33:26.734
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice associated that.
So yes in theory you can the fact that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29344-3
00:33:26.734 --> 00:33:29.020
<v Josh Sparkes>you've onboarded these clients.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29349-0
00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:33.514
<v Josh Sparkes>Can be part of the dropdown,
so you have to avoid this pretext in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29349-1
00:33:33.514 --> 00:33:34.140
<v Josh Sparkes>principle.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29402-0
00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:44.340
<v Parik Narain>Can I just point back to the conversation
we had a few couple of hours back around</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29365-0
00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:43.900
<v Josh Sparkes>Mhm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29402-1
00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:48.588
<v Parik Narain>the CRM, right. So the customer data,
your clients and obviously it's a bit</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29402-2
00:33:48.588 --> 00:33:51.831
<v Parik Narain>could be a technical discussion which
I'll do separately,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29402-3
00:33:51.831 --> 00:33:56.247
<v Parik Narain>but is CRM the right source for that?
Can we look at getting the data from CRM</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29402-4
00:33:56.247 --> 00:33:57.420
<v Parik Narain>as a source of truth?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29420-0
00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:03.082
<v Parik Narain>You have two CRM's you mentioned and that
could give us all the clients and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29409-0
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:01.340
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29420-1
00:34:03.082 --> 00:34:05.100
<v Parik Narain>subsidiaries and etcetera, etcetera.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29445-0
00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.891
<v Josh Sparkes>I think I was just going to ask the
question along the lines of where does</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29445-1
00:34:09.891 --> 00:34:12.117
<v Josh Sparkes>this number come from or where is it
stored?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29434-0
00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:11.180
<v Parik Narain>Mm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29445-2
00:34:12.117 --> 00:34:14.689
<v Josh Sparkes>Does it a static place or is it different
for each?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29445-3
00:34:14.689 --> 00:34:16.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Where do you pull that number from?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29443-0
00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:17.180
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29468-0
00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:22.369
<v Josh Sparkes>Which number? The client ID,
client e-billing reference number.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29468-1
00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:27.538
<v Josh Sparkes>The reference is at the matter level,
so it would be down to the public or the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29468-2
00:34:27.538 --> 00:34:31.399
<v Josh Sparkes>PE would provide that.
Is it saved in our system anywhere?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29468-3
00:34:31.399 --> 00:34:35.260
<v Josh Sparkes>It should be saved in three,
but it's not the same always.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29471-0
00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:36.780
<v Josh Sparkes>Always there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29467-0
00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:37.020
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29515-0
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:44.057
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll just get added to the investment and
to where they get it from them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29515-1
00:34:44.057 --> 00:34:47.978
<v Josh Sparkes>It would be an question.
They would get it from their matter</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29515-2
00:34:47.978 --> 00:34:51.256
<v Josh Sparkes>contract to the client side.
They will provide it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29515-3
00:34:51.256 --> 00:34:55.819
<v Josh Sparkes>They should put it into three.
This should all happen after reception,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29515-4
00:34:55.819 --> 00:34:56.140
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29561-0
00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.617
<v Josh Sparkes>And by there's candles,
build the stream and build and raise the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29561-1
00:34:59.617 --> 00:35:01.966
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice.
It should automatically pull through to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29561-2
00:35:01.966 --> 00:35:05.417
<v Josh Sparkes>the invoice media. Yeah, you could go,
but sometimes they won't get it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29561-3
00:35:05.417 --> 00:35:08.198
<v Josh Sparkes>They'll get the invoice.
They'll go to the client, right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29561-4
00:35:08.198 --> 00:35:10.739
<v Josh Sparkes>Can we pay this? No,
he's going to e-mail it. Right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29561-5
00:35:10.739 --> 00:35:14.430
<v Josh Sparkes>Here's your reference number back to
Billy, and that's on an e-mail at this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29561-6
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:15.820
<v Josh Sparkes>So sometimes it doesn't even.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29564-0
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.340
<v Josh Sparkes>System is down to the PA on their
housekeeping.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29611-0
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.648
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
I'm just thinking about potential for</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29571-0
00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.740
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, so um.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29611-1
00:35:23.648 --> 00:35:28.268
<v Josh Sparkes>integration or anything like that,
but I don't know that there is as I say</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29611-2
00:35:28.268 --> 00:35:33.011
<v Josh Sparkes>it is a it is a potential for integration
and we we should look at use case,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29587-0
00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.260
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, so it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29611-3
00:35:33.011 --> 00:35:38.001
<v Josh Sparkes>but there's also a much larger process
that needs to be fixed on the free E side</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29611-4
00:35:38.001 --> 00:35:38.740
<v Josh Sparkes>rather than.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29614-0
00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.020
<v Josh Sparkes>Try to fix it here if that makes sense.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29648-0
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:47.663
<v Josh Sparkes>Wondering if it's a question for our data
team around what data boxes that you use</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29648-1
00:35:47.663 --> 00:35:51.010
<v Josh Sparkes>in 3D from that.
If we can get some clarity on that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29642-0
00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:50.140
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29648-2
00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:52.020
<v Josh Sparkes>it might inform.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29654-0
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:57.020
<v Parik Narain>I will take that back. Um.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29664-0
00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:59.380
<v Josh Sparkes>A document that using the scenario in the
source is.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29715-0
00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:02.175
<v Parik Narain>Let me let me take that back because
we're having a few discussions around the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29715-1
00:36:02.175 --> 00:36:05.838
<v Parik Narain>integration in the coming days.
So I'll take both of these points back</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29715-2
00:36:05.838 --> 00:36:08.262
<v Parik Narain>around CRM,
healthy complements that obviously</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29715-3
00:36:08.262 --> 00:36:12.234
<v Parik Narain>billing is 3 itself and then where is
where the source of customer data or a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29691-0
00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:09.100
<v Josh Sparkes>So.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29715-4
00:36:12.234 --> 00:36:16.360
<v Parik Narain>client data from because it's it could be
a combination of three and CRM itself</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29715-5
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.340
<v Parik Narain>across the process.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29751-0
00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:23.938
<v Josh Sparkes>I I don't think CRM is a single source of
truth and I wouldn't rely on that in the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29721-0
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:21.900
<v Parik Narain>Got it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29751-1
00:36:23.938 --> 00:36:29.950
<v Josh Sparkes>short term on the basis that we've got a
review of our CRM system on ongoing.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29729-0
00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.060
<v Parik Narain>Mhm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29751-2
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:34.420
<v Josh Sparkes>So any integration that we did with that
would then just.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29774-0
00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.786
<v Josh Sparkes>Be redundant.
But I think it's just good to understand</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29774-1
00:36:37.786 --> 00:36:41.340
<v Josh Sparkes>the source of the truth.
We need to go and think about that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29784-0
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:44.260
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, yeah, definitely. Sure, sure.
We'll take it back as as a parking item.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29787-0
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.384
<v Josh Sparkes>Tim,
is that something that you could take</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29787-1
00:36:45.384 --> 00:36:47.940
<v Josh Sparkes>around on as well with the data
governance team?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29792-0
00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.740
<v Josh Sparkes>Sort of JP's owners.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29808-0
00:36:54.540 --> 00:37:02.460
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm going right to the fields at the
requester, so we've landed on.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29835-0
00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:08.900
<v Josh Sparkes>Reference value over 100,000,
which should be good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29835-1
00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:15.600
<v Josh Sparkes>And then that rules for one client,
multiple invoices, one client,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29835-2
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.900
<v Josh Sparkes>multiple and so that's very good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29880-0
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.049
<v Josh Sparkes>It's about three times,
but the over 100 one,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29880-1
00:37:22.049 --> 00:37:27.045
<v Josh Sparkes>we defer like taking that from the field
of the value or you want a thing in a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29880-2
00:37:27.045 --> 00:37:30.776
<v Josh Sparkes>checkbox inside afterwards. Yeah,
you can have a checkbox.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29880-3
00:37:30.776 --> 00:37:34.128
<v Josh Sparkes>Just take the value of the field though.
Yeah, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29880-4
00:37:34.128 --> 00:37:37.100
<v Josh Sparkes>just check that in the sense that it
picks up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29916-0
00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:41.836
<v Josh Sparkes>Your prioritization matrix,
as you said that it will be also</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29916-1
00:37:41.836 --> 00:37:45.852
<v Josh Sparkes>assigning if it's over 100,
000 and is that your point,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29916-2
00:37:45.852 --> 00:37:50.012
<v Josh Sparkes>is it over 100,
000 or total value of the invoices or any</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29916-3
00:37:50.012 --> 00:37:52.020
<v Josh Sparkes>one of them is over 100,000?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29919-0
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.260
<v Josh Sparkes>1000.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29956-0
00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:01.074
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be a combination.
So probably we need a combination of a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29956-1
00:38:01.074 --> 00:38:06.200
<v Josh Sparkes>checkbox over 100,
000 and adding up the values to be over</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29956-2
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.544
<v Josh Sparkes>100,000.
You could have and less quickly 10 at 10</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29956-3
00:38:10.544 --> 00:38:14.540
<v Josh Sparkes>equating over.
So individually small changes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29983-0
00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:21.068
<v Josh Sparkes>I could actually have to break it.
I think I think she said the date of the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29983-1
00:38:21.068 --> 00:38:27.300
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice wasn't going to like the stuff
that's aging is only just 166 months old.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29983-2
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.300
<v Josh Sparkes>So again having anything over a certain
date range.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/29989-0
00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.660
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a power, yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30032-0
00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.638
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah. Is that the catching catching date?
Sorry,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30032-1
00:38:36.638 --> 00:38:41.192
<v Mark Sedgey>just to check that I heard that right,
you you want to catch the date it was</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30032-2
00:38:41.192 --> 00:38:45.923
<v Mark Sedgey>raised and then the date it gets to you
sort of thing so you can report against</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30069-0
00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.425
<v Josh Sparkes>You know the invoice,
you know just the invoice date because</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30032-3
00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:46.100
<v Mark Sedgey>it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30069-1
00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:51.619
<v Josh Sparkes>when what we do when we receive the
request request, we go into three,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30069-2
00:38:51.619 --> 00:38:56.169
<v Josh Sparkes>we've got a people in history form and we
record when we receive the date of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30069-3
00:38:56.169 --> 00:38:59.300
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice and that's what we use to track
our metrics.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30091-0
00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.795
<v Josh Sparkes>How long wait till it takes us to upload
new works? Good to see, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30061-0
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:00.860
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30091-1
00:39:03.795 --> 00:39:06.357
<v Josh Sparkes>the aging ones,
if it is like 6 months old,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30091-2
00:39:06.357 --> 00:39:07.580
<v Josh Sparkes>we should prioritize.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30105-0
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.724
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah,
'cause that was something you did want to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30139-0
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:14.405
<v Josh Sparkes>They can't fire retirements. Yeah,
and we want these ones to push the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30105-1
00:39:10.724 --> 00:39:13.503
<v Mark Sedgey>be able to report.
You wanted to be able to report on that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30105-2
00:39:13.503 --> 00:39:13.780
<v Mark Sedgey>right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30139-1
00:39:14.405 --> 00:39:19.754
<v Josh Sparkes>So if they enter the invoice date as well
as a field by the requester, OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30139-2
00:39:19.754 --> 00:39:24.034
<v Josh Sparkes>and that could vary.
So they could have one for six months,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30139-3
00:39:24.034 --> 00:39:25.460
<v Josh Sparkes>they could have one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30167-0
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.732
<v Josh Sparkes>For this month process as well.
So for the client,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30167-1
00:39:30.732 --> 00:39:35.575
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be a variation of old plus new
coming in. Is that correct?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30167-2
00:39:35.575 --> 00:39:40.845
<v Josh Sparkes>But still that becomes a priority. Yeah,
we just take the oldest one. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30167-3
00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Josh Sparkes>got that noted, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30175-0
00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:50.020
<v Josh Sparkes>Want to stick to the upload topic and go
through? Yes, Yep.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30188-0
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:59.300
<v Josh Sparkes>So we could talk to who can raise such a
thing or finance you guys responding.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30241-0
00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:08.793
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just ad hoc presumably or do they
come in ad hoc towards the end of the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30241-1
00:40:08.793 --> 00:40:15.195
<v Josh Sparkes>month always the last last couple of days,
first couple of days and as a service,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30241-2
00:40:15.195 --> 00:40:20.739
<v Josh Sparkes>is it useful? So for example,
you know that there's a client's been on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30241-3
00:40:20.739 --> 00:40:22.300
<v Josh Sparkes>boarded and we know.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30287-0
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:26.210
<v Josh Sparkes>But on that regularly we should get
monthly invoicing.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30287-1
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:31.363
<v Josh Sparkes>So is there something that you would
consider that a service you could do</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30287-2
00:40:31.363 --> 00:40:36.934
<v Josh Sparkes>schedule that that or reminder that we
should be expecting invoices to come in?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30287-3
00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:41.460
<v Josh Sparkes>No, that's not on yourself,
that's on the requester to see that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30295-0
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:46.580
<v Josh Sparkes>It's good in terms that we can look if
I'm working.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30320-0
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:53.814
<v Josh Sparkes>Workload headcount holidays and we're
going to peak periods.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30320-1
00:40:53.814 --> 00:41:00.220
<v Josh Sparkes>That's more like my considering you have
a recurring invoice like.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30364-0
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.988
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So it's much more sort of a proactive</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30364-1
00:41:05.988 --> 00:41:13.131
<v Josh Sparkes>activity that we could capture.
We'd request to ignore that if it's going</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30364-2
00:41:13.131 --> 00:41:20.660
<v Josh Sparkes>to be a referring invoice to be able to
provide that information at the time.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30402-0
00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:26.305
<v Josh Sparkes>They should, yeah. Yes,
they'll still have to resubmit a new. Yes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30402-1
00:41:26.305 --> 00:41:31.811
<v Josh Sparkes>it's part of their requester.
It could be part of their notification or</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30402-2
00:41:31.811 --> 00:41:35.482
<v Josh Sparkes>their pass,
but based on that recurring invoice</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30402-3
00:41:35.482 --> 00:41:37.700
<v Josh Sparkes>activity, you'll proactively.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30459-0
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:44.954
<v Josh Sparkes>And that they they see it as a prompt
that I'm not going to send you on the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30459-1
00:41:44.954 --> 00:41:47.641
<v Josh Sparkes>28th.
I'm just trying to think because we could</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30459-2
00:41:47.641 --> 00:41:50.551
<v Josh Sparkes>put that.
I'm just worried that if we trigger these</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30459-3
00:41:50.551 --> 00:41:54.021
<v Josh Sparkes>types of notifications,
you might have PS who've got loads of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30459-4
00:41:54.021 --> 00:41:55.420
<v Josh Sparkes>these to submit and then.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30491-0
00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:00.249
<v Josh Sparkes>They're bombarded with these
notifications saying you've got monthly</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30491-1
00:42:00.249 --> 00:42:03.973
<v Josh Sparkes>time to submit. They see this,
they send the rules over.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30491-2
00:42:03.973 --> 00:42:06.913
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the priority ones over 100,000.
I mean,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30491-3
00:42:06.913 --> 00:42:10.180
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just a half thinking we can note for
future.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30552-0
00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.661
<v Josh Sparkes>As you said, yeah,
we're thinking about rather than you say</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30552-1
00:42:14.661 --> 00:42:18.036
<v Josh Sparkes>multiple notifications.
I think it's probably just a quite a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30552-2
00:42:18.036 --> 00:42:22.408
<v Josh Sparkes>difference to the way that we currently
work for our requesters and if they're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30552-3
00:42:22.408 --> 00:42:26.835
<v Josh Sparkes>getting a prompt to tell them to then
send that and just you manage that from a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30552-4
00:42:26.835 --> 00:42:30.100
<v Josh Sparkes>change management perspective and
understand the benefits.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30554-0
00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.380
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, we can partners, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30583-0
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:44.610
<v Josh Sparkes>And more than part partly look back. OK,
that's scheduling for upload. Yeah, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30583-1
00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:51.155
<v Josh Sparkes>visibility on the portal.
So anybody in finance can have visibility</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30583-2
00:42:51.155 --> 00:42:51.540
<v Josh Sparkes>for.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30592-0
00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:56.302
<v Josh Sparkes>And inquestor,
I think there's not be any requester</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30592-1
00:42:56.302 --> 00:42:58.220
<v Josh Sparkes>sending requestor all sorts.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30607-0
00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:05.641
<v Josh Sparkes>Hi, London. Billing will be doing it.
What will it be connected up?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30607-1
00:43:05.641 --> 00:43:08.260
<v Josh Sparkes>The regional finance offices.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30613-0
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, associates. Oh, OK, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30614-0
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:20.100
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30649-0
00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:28.740
<v Josh Sparkes>Or trail that team requests.
We should say you've got the value,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30649-1
00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:36.368
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got skills, matrix, maybe client,
again, client specific VI PS. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30649-2
00:43:36.368 --> 00:43:39.340
<v Josh Sparkes>not only clients, VIP clients.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30679-0
00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:45.578
<v Josh Sparkes>And we can get that make sure it's off
you. But again, would you have,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30679-1
00:43:45.578 --> 00:43:52.156
<v Josh Sparkes>because it's going to be a global form,
can anybody in the e-billing pick it up</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30679-2
00:43:52.156 --> 00:43:54.540
<v Josh Sparkes>essentially so they could be?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30728-0
00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:58.560
<v Josh Sparkes>Someone in Australia knows you're
following the sun.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30728-1
00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:04.160
<v Josh Sparkes>Anybody in the team can pick it up and
upload it to the portal. Is that? So Asia,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30728-2
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:08.121
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia, beginning,
Brisbane and the rest of the world.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30728-3
00:44:08.121 --> 00:44:12.560
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's what you do today.
That's what we do today. But yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30728-4
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.540
<v Josh Sparkes>because you can move forward.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30768-0
00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:18.962
<v Josh Sparkes>Forwards for particularly as you said,
you know when you're getting things or</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30768-1
00:44:18.962 --> 00:44:22.713
<v Josh Sparkes>last minute or the due date six months
ago, any member of the team,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30768-2
00:44:22.713 --> 00:44:27.235
<v Josh Sparkes>e-building team globally can pick it up.
So as we're following the principles set</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30768-3
00:44:27.235 --> 00:44:30.820
<v Josh Sparkes>with the other ones here with the
conditional based on location.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30806-0
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:36.906
<v Josh Sparkes>Conditional location,
but then reassigned for agency that any</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30806-1
00:44:36.906 --> 00:44:40.916
<v Josh Sparkes>member. Yeah,
we have some instances on home,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30806-2
00:44:40.916 --> 00:44:47.194
<v Josh Sparkes>we're online and they're like,
can you want like stuff like that? Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30806-3
00:44:47.194 --> 00:44:49.460
<v Josh Sparkes>and you get that activity.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30825-0
00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:55.327
<v Josh Sparkes>Away from your dashboard that's
outstanding, as Mark says,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30825-1
00:44:55.327 --> 00:45:00.558
<v Josh Sparkes>probably breaching, coming to be,
you know, buying limits and as a team,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30825-2
00:45:00.558 --> 00:45:02.420
<v Josh Sparkes>anyone you can pick it up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30873-0
00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:08.761
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
it's going to be available to all</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30873-1
00:45:08.761 --> 00:45:13.372
<v Josh Sparkes>countries. Yeah,
one form skill metrics plus as you said,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30873-2
00:45:13.372 --> 00:45:19.175
<v Josh Sparkes>some VIP clients localisation,
but generally as a global team of ways of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30873-3
00:45:19.175 --> 00:45:23.865
<v Josh Sparkes>working, you know,
within a 24 hour period each of you are</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30873-4
00:45:23.865 --> 00:45:24.580
<v Josh Sparkes>probably.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30887-0
00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:29.908
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, if it's a heavy load in the UK,
there's no no doubt that the Australian</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30887-1
00:45:29.908 --> 00:45:32.780
<v Josh Sparkes>team can pick up that,
get through those counts.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30893-0
00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:38.100
<v Josh Sparkes>Um, other fields. So this is um.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30947-0
00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:45.414
<v Josh Sparkes>On the records that you might have that's
a bit like the onboarding where you have</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30947-1
00:45:45.414 --> 00:45:50.994
<v Josh Sparkes>a checkbox that you uploaded Steve in the
portal when you did that with there was a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30947-2
00:45:50.994 --> 00:45:54.780
<v Josh Sparkes>reference back.
So is there any activities that you have</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30947-3
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.500
<v Josh Sparkes>that you might find useful to mark
against that record?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30952-0
00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:02.460
<v Josh Sparkes>Once you've received it from the
requester.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30986-0
00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:12.695
<v Josh Sparkes>It's going back to your message.
It's uploaded or the invoice rejected and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30986-1
00:46:12.695 --> 00:46:20.583
<v Josh Sparkes>we either in which we will then or to do
an action or it's on us to do actions.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/30986-2
00:46:20.583 --> 00:46:25.020
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's either uploaded,
which is basically.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31008-0
00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:30.521
<v Josh Sparkes>And then that's. And so at that point,
you know that it's been accepted. Mm-hmm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31008-1
00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:35.540
<v Josh Sparkes>And therefore, within the service,
you can mark its code complete. Mm-hmm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31037-0
00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:41.636
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's probably a a state uploaded TE
billing and that's probably that's that's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31037-1
00:46:41.636 --> 00:46:46.511
<v Josh Sparkes>closed approved essentially and then from
that point on the form saying that they</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31037-2
00:46:46.511 --> 00:46:47.700
<v Josh Sparkes>need to be rejected.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31069-0
00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:54.112
<v Josh Sparkes>So and then back into the service,
it will be rejected, reasons,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31069-1
00:46:54.112 --> 00:47:00.081
<v Josh Sparkes>root cause analysis and then and what's
the variety of those reasons rejected the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31069-2
00:47:00.081 --> 00:47:05.540
<v Josh Sparkes>rates. They're not even industry. Yeah,
these are work notes that we have.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31083-0
00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:12.239
<v Josh Sparkes>Projective wise might be the portal,
the client or us and the team and then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31083-1
00:47:12.239 --> 00:47:15.020
<v Josh Sparkes>it's all within the eight reasons.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31101-0
00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:21.704
<v Josh Sparkes>Category.
So it can be the budget hasn't been in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31101-1
00:47:21.704 --> 00:47:26.843
<v Josh Sparkes>place,
the matter hasn't been signed in the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31101-2
00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:27.660
<v Josh Sparkes>portal.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31107-0
00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.820
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean the right syndrome.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31143-0
00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:39.200
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. And some of those are picked up.
Those reasons that you just said are</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31143-1
00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:46.091
<v Josh Sparkes>picked up downstream on timekeeper and so
we've got some of that crossover and so</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31143-2
00:47:46.091 --> 00:47:48.780
<v Josh Sparkes>rejected by us probably reduces.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31181-0
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:53.016
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
And then you got rejected by clients,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31181-1
00:47:53.016 --> 00:47:58.666
<v Josh Sparkes>which again can be addressed by the
timekeeper. Yeah, right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31181-2
00:47:58.666 --> 00:48:05.427
<v Josh Sparkes>The time was scraped right up.
Then we have to push it back to the PE to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31181-3
00:48:05.427 --> 00:48:08.020
<v Josh Sparkes>get more information for it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31229-0
00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.285
<v Josh Sparkes>Justify client,
rejected by us and rejected by portal.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31229-1
00:48:11.285 --> 00:48:15.859
<v Josh Sparkes>So the portal is generally the budget
isn't in place all the time to keep the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31229-2
00:48:15.859 --> 00:48:18.673
<v Josh Sparkes>rates.
So the portal is doing the heavy work to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31229-3
00:48:18.673 --> 00:48:22.661
<v Josh Sparkes>do the initial reject before it even gets
to a client approval. OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31229-4
00:48:22.661 --> 00:48:25.885
<v Josh Sparkes>And so even if it passes portal,
the client can still,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31229-5
00:48:25.885 --> 00:48:27.820
<v Josh Sparkes>it can get rejected at any point.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31261-0
00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:32.894
<v Josh Sparkes>From that invoice going into and it can
get rejected multiple times for different</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31261-1
00:48:32.894 --> 00:48:36.609
<v Josh Sparkes>reasons. So the porter can reject it,
we fix it, it goes in,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31261-2
00:48:36.609 --> 00:48:39.776
<v Josh Sparkes>the client can see it. Nope,
the client rejects it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31261-3
00:48:39.776 --> 00:48:42.820
<v Josh Sparkes>So at this point your upload invoice is
still in.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31264-0
00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:44.820
<v Josh Sparkes>A state of.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31313-0
00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:51.909
<v Josh Sparkes>Openness as it were until until final
approval of passing all that gates in,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31313-1
00:48:51.909 --> 00:48:58.071
<v Josh Sparkes>probably to touch on that point budget in
place if that field that on timekeeper or</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31313-2
00:48:58.071 --> 00:49:03.573
<v Josh Sparkes>admin we'd capture to make sure that
therefore your rejection rate at this</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31313-3
00:49:03.573 --> 00:49:04.820
<v Josh Sparkes>point is reduced.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31358-0
00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:10.598
<v Josh Sparkes>Budget, we don't get access to that.
You don't know that to any of the pre</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31358-1
00:49:10.598 --> 00:49:14.374
<v Josh Sparkes>some portals.
We submit budget and it goes to approval.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31358-2
00:49:14.374 --> 00:49:18.082
<v Josh Sparkes>Majority of the portals,
we don't get to see anything.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31358-3
00:49:18.082 --> 00:49:21.116
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't get access,
we don't get to see it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31358-4
00:49:21.116 --> 00:49:24.420
<v Josh Sparkes>we don't get submitted to be done by the
client.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31390-0
00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:29.209
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe you can't even track it to see if
how much volume we've consumed to go to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31390-1
00:49:29.209 --> 00:49:31.594
<v Josh Sparkes>trigger an actions.
I was just trying to ask,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31390-2
00:49:31.594 --> 00:49:35.638
<v Josh Sparkes>do you see what the rejection reason is
or the kind of information that helps</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31390-3
00:49:35.638 --> 00:49:39.060
<v Josh Sparkes>with the does that help?
You don't get any of that at the moment.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31394-0
00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.980
<v Josh Sparkes>Was very little. Yeah, it's very.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31423-0
00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:47.600
<v Josh Sparkes>Something,
something that we can capture on that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31423-1
00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.294
<v Josh Sparkes>side is kind of open and to unpick and to
put in place upstream,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31423-2
00:49:52.294 --> 00:49:58.289
<v Josh Sparkes>but you just get a rejection essentially
and you have to unpick it and it tends to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31423-3
00:49:58.289 --> 00:49:59.300
<v Josh Sparkes>be on budgets.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31424-0
00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:00.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Rights.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31465-0
00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:05.190
<v Josh Sparkes>Other things, yeah,
client entity would be billing the wrong</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31465-1
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:10.380
<v Josh Sparkes>entity on that invoice and then it has to
go back and get the first and get change.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31465-2
00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:14.767
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just like your pre-checks.
So maybe that's a we feel that we can</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31465-3
00:50:14.767 --> 00:50:16.620
<v Josh Sparkes>capture client entity as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31505-0
00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:22.254
<v Josh Sparkes>That's only invoice upload.
This information, we don't see it at all.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31505-1
00:50:22.254 --> 00:50:25.525
<v Josh Sparkes>So even if we upload the matter into the
portal,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31505-2
00:50:25.525 --> 00:50:29.864
<v Josh Sparkes>we don't know what entity it's what the
client's attached to it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31505-3
00:50:29.864 --> 00:50:33.669
<v Josh Sparkes>So even if we get it on the form,
we can't even. Oh, OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31505-4
00:50:33.669 --> 00:50:36.740
<v Josh Sparkes>there's only one portal that we can do it
on.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31506-0
00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:38.300
<v Josh Sparkes>It's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31555-0
00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:42.904
<v Josh Sparkes>And we would on that particular.
So that's legal traffic.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31555-1
00:50:42.904 --> 00:50:47.552
<v Josh Sparkes>If we see the entity is different,
we would have to reject it back to the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31555-2
00:50:47.552 --> 00:50:50.317
<v Josh Sparkes>team and go, no,
this is up to this entity,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31555-3
00:50:50.317 --> 00:50:54.525
<v Josh Sparkes>your invoices to London,
this is to the US, you need to change it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31555-4
00:50:54.525 --> 00:50:57.980
<v Josh Sparkes>So we would try and stop as many
rejections as we can.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31584-0
00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:05.756
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's a good point. Yes,
but it's that reactive capturing it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31584-1
00:51:05.756 --> 00:51:13.494
<v Josh Sparkes>upstream. Is that, you know,
using that because it is very high and I</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31584-2
00:51:13.494 --> 00:51:14.820
<v Josh Sparkes>think it is.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31629-0
00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:20.891
<v Josh Sparkes>Meeting towards public standard scenes,
a lot of that until we get this all</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31629-1
00:51:20.891 --> 00:51:26.298
<v Josh Sparkes>captured at mattering section and
everything's all laid out properly,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31629-2
00:51:26.298 --> 00:51:30.700
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just going to have this issue and
it's going to be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31641-0
00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:36.064
<v Josh Sparkes>Have all that building information and
the entity as well needs to be tied up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31641-1
00:51:36.064 --> 00:51:39.340
<v Josh Sparkes>I wish it's outside of home really,
rather than.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31648-0
00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.100
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that should have, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31704-0
00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:53.147
<v Josh Sparkes>But we've captured in some of the evening,
as you said, well,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31704-1
00:51:53.147 --> 00:51:58.283
<v Josh Sparkes>some of the brief fields that might be
rejected by us. That's good. Sorry,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31704-2
00:51:58.283 --> 00:52:02.598
<v Josh Sparkes>just a quick question.
We set clients up in the we set them up</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31681-0
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.060
<v Mark Sedgey>Just to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31704-3
00:52:02.598 --> 00:52:07.940
<v Josh Sparkes>with a sort of a client address and then
an invoice address or they'll often.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31731-0
00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:12.770
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, we need to. Yeah,
they'll send one of the client and then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31731-1
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:15.969
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll have the different the client
entities.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31731-2
00:52:15.969 --> 00:52:21.585
<v Josh Sparkes>So someone to me that's really still
understood if it's this this client group</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31731-3
00:52:21.585 --> 00:52:23.220
<v Josh Sparkes>that's the invoice, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31736-0
00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:27.620
<v Josh Sparkes>Well, that is the case.
Why is that not getting picked up?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31750-0
00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:39.060
<v Josh Sparkes>We could be engaging in London,
but actually it's the French.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31765-0
00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:49.208
<v Josh Sparkes>And who does that get? Who that get fixed?
That just seems like the data entry issue</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31765-1
00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:51.380
<v Josh Sparkes>in the Yeah, and I don't.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31768-0
00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.620
<v Josh Sparkes>Who's doing that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31781-0
00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:03.060
<v Mark Sedgey>Forgive me guys,
we can't hear the answers on uh from you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31773-0
00:52:58.780 --> 00:52:58.900
<v Josh Sparkes>Use.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31851-0
00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:05.876
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a wider issue that's part of the
project that are going on for rates and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31851-1
00:53:05.876 --> 00:53:08.802
<v Josh Sparkes>matter inception and how they set all
that up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31851-2
00:53:08.802 --> 00:53:13.968
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's not stuff we're going to be able
to solve and do it from an earlier point.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31851-3
00:53:13.968 --> 00:53:17.641
<v Josh Sparkes>We will always need to have a certain
level of rejections.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31851-4
00:53:17.641 --> 00:53:20.940
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just the situation that we're in at
the moment.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31862-0
00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:24.109
<v Josh Sparkes>Until that project joins up what we need
to do, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31862-1
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:27.540
<v Josh Sparkes>and we can just capture the insights of
that at this point.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31892-0
00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:37.960
<v Josh Sparkes>I think probably the next month she goes
away because it's corrected is a one off</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31892-1
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:41.700
<v Josh Sparkes>activity which has been corrected.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31936-0
00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:45.363
<v Mark Sedgey>In the sorry guys in the data in that
previous cell that you're in Josh,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31936-1
00:53:45.363 --> 00:53:50.550
<v Mark Sedgey>are you expecting to have a like a
comments box for additional information?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31936-2
00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:55.942
<v Mark Sedgey>Just generally it's it's usually pretty
good to have like a free form comments</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31936-3
00:53:55.942 --> 00:53:59.900
<v Mark Sedgey>box for just additional comments notes at
point of which.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31948-0
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:04.623
<v Mark Sedgey>The case is created.
Sometimes that can be useful to capture</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31948-1
00:54:04.623 --> 00:54:06.820
<v Mark Sedgey>various insights to the record.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/31967-0
00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:18.580
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, working notes are sometimes useful.
We have that standard standard across the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32012-0
00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:21.207
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, I was thinking,
I was thinking more about not necessarily</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32012-1
00:54:21.207 --> 00:54:24.793
<v Mark Sedgey>in the working way.
I suppose it could go in the working</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32012-2
00:54:24.793 --> 00:54:29.701
<v Mark Sedgey>notes, but often there's some, you know,
you have an initial submission text,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32012-3
00:54:29.701 --> 00:54:33.476
<v Mark Sedgey>just additional text.
It's it can be useful just which sits</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32012-4
00:54:33.476 --> 00:54:35.300
<v Mark Sedgey>there, you know, in paturity.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32065-0
00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:40.117
<v Mark Sedgey>For you know that you can report against
potentially look for keyword searches and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32065-1
00:54:40.117 --> 00:54:42.781
<v Mark Sedgey>things like that.
Just just something to to raise.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32065-2
00:54:42.781 --> 00:54:46.908
<v Mark Sedgey>I typically do them on all my requests
that I would shape just have additional</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32065-3
00:54:46.908 --> 00:54:51.192
<v Mark Sedgey>comments filled in case there's something
that's informative that the agent wants</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32065-4
00:54:51.192 --> 00:54:54.536
<v Mark Sedgey>to raise. Just something to think about.
It doesn't have to be,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32065-5
00:54:54.536 --> 00:54:55.580
<v Mark Sedgey>it's just a thought.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32096-0
00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:02.291
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, can be, as I said,
probably reporting on notes. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32096-1
00:55:02.291 --> 00:55:08.260
<v Josh Sparkes>Are we talking about the requester adding
Mark or the the agent? OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32160-0
00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:09.569
<v Mark Sedgey>No, even the agent.
So the agent generating the record,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32160-1
00:55:09.569 --> 00:55:13.653
<v Mark Sedgey>there might be something pertinent that
they don't want to put because trouble is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32103-0
00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:13.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32160-2
00:55:13.653 --> 00:55:17.238
<v Mark Sedgey>if you put it in the work notes,
it might not jump out to the audience,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32160-3
00:55:17.238 --> 00:55:20.674
<v Mark Sedgey>say reviewing the front page.
So there might be something pertinent.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32160-4
00:55:20.674 --> 00:55:24.260
<v Mark Sedgey>So you just do a general additional
comments field so that if there was</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32145-0
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:24.980
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32160-5
00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:26.500
<v Mark Sedgey>anything they wanted to jump out that
first.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32164-0
00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:32.100
<v Mark Sedgey>View without having to look at the notes.
That would be the place to position it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32202-0
00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:37.064
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, what you do at the moment,
if it's rejected to say timekeepers,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32202-1
00:55:37.064 --> 00:55:43.187
<v Josh Sparkes>they'll put the member in the team will
put weighted timekeeper approval in the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32202-2
00:55:43.187 --> 00:55:48.620
<v Josh Sparkes>subject line of the ticket so they know
that they're waiting. Yes, so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32199-0
00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:48.340
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32238-0
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:54.061
<v Josh Sparkes>So that could be as based on if you just
manage it in workflow rather than text</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32238-1
00:55:54.061 --> 00:55:58.022
<v Josh Sparkes>based on that rejection,
you could then have the additional</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32238-2
00:55:58.022 --> 00:56:02.906
<v Josh Sparkes>waiting waiting information or waiting.
We have to have lots of them that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32238-3
00:56:02.906 --> 00:56:04.820
<v Josh Sparkes>awaiting further information.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32251-0
00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:12.300
<v Josh Sparkes>And so it's an actual reportable
dashboard activity flagged.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32263-0
00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:18.300
<v Josh Sparkes>But additional notes, yeah, to be careful,
could be useful for key.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32308-0
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:21.707
<v Mark Sedgey>There were where I'm thinking of those
sort of things is sometimes the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32308-1
00:56:21.707 --> 00:56:26.268
<v Mark Sedgey>additional note might be this is the
ninth time round that we've tried to do</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32308-2
00:56:26.268 --> 00:56:30.948
<v Mark Sedgey>this or you know some some just pertinent
to that record that enables you know</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32308-3
00:56:30.948 --> 00:56:33.140
<v Mark Sedgey>future analysis or a I investigation.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32314-0
00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:37.220
<v Mark Sedgey>Support type stuff, but anyway it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32335-0
00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:41.403
<v Josh Sparkes>As you said,
it's probably we could add it as a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32335-1
00:56:41.403 --> 00:56:44.990
<v Josh Sparkes>standard feature across cases. Yeah,
correct.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32329-0
00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:44.780
<v Mark Sedgey>Yep.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32335-2
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:48.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you have another that was covered to
go?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32338-0
00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:56.540
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32365-0
00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:03.186
<v Josh Sparkes>Where are we at?
Workflow for upload and we've talked to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32365-1
00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:09.008
<v Josh Sparkes>it. Workflows for the requester,
one client, multiple invoices, one client,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32365-2
00:57:09.008 --> 00:57:13.220
<v Josh Sparkes>one invoice and we complete that with the
value dates.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32388-0
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:23.346
<v Josh Sparkes>And finds name in the and then which is
only saved as a global process.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32388-1
00:57:23.346 --> 00:57:28.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Nation skill matrix aligned on workflow.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32440-0
00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:40.622
<v Josh Sparkes>Process we've got two lots of live checks,
so we have one specific for one I end</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32440-1
00:57:40.622 --> 00:57:45.928
<v Josh Sparkes>that always has to get checked and then
another one is auto submit.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32440-2
00:57:45.928 --> 00:57:50.220
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have different types of uploads.
We have upload.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32455-0
00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:55.868
<v Josh Sparkes>And also submit those.
So we just need these are high risk.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32455-1
00:57:55.868 --> 00:58:00.380
<v Josh Sparkes>Just tell me the first two PDF or leads.
So yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32475-0
00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:07.638
<v Josh Sparkes>So live check complaints.
Everything needs to get reviewed right to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32475-1
00:58:07.638 --> 00:58:11.350
<v Josh Sparkes>upload.
So now I will go to the team e-mail</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32475-2
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:11.940
<v Josh Sparkes>myself.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32527-0
00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:16.499
<v Josh Sparkes>And that can be tracked.
So you would have live check,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32527-1
00:58:16.499 --> 00:58:20.691
<v Josh Sparkes>you know based on that more as you said,
this is what gets live checked.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32527-2
00:58:20.691 --> 00:58:24.251
<v Josh Sparkes>But from an audit perspective rather than
just looking at it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32527-3
00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:29.017
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be live checked or like approved,
like reviewed whatever you want on that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32527-4
00:58:29.017 --> 00:58:32.060
<v Josh Sparkes>label and then reviewed by.
So you've got the check.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32534-0
00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:34.675
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
'cause that's the moment is on an Excel</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32534-1
00:58:34.675 --> 00:58:37.020
<v Josh Sparkes>document.
We'll just take it through and then.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32581-0
00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:42.383
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
but you could do it on this form and then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32581-1
00:58:42.383 --> 00:58:48.808
<v Josh Sparkes>you're not locking your own homework.
So if you're log, if it's yours,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32581-2
00:58:48.808 --> 00:58:54.780
<v Josh Sparkes>you're not like checking. Yeah, yeah.
And do you want to do that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32584-0
00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:57.540
<v Josh Sparkes>That bulk is there multiple ones where
you could.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32641-0
00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:03.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry,
can I just stay here about the live check</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32641-1
00:59:03.177 --> 00:59:06.740
<v Josh Sparkes>stuff?
So I think what we've talked about</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32641-2
00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:13.696
<v Josh Sparkes>previously in the system is that we'll
use an approver task to do the live check.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32641-3
00:59:13.696 --> 00:59:18.700
<v Josh Sparkes>So because it will be a peer and the team
that will do it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32670-0
00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:23.159
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can see a task on the workflow,
it goes to the peer and as part of that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32670-1
00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:25.771
<v Josh Sparkes>task,
the checklist should be included in that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32670-2
00:59:25.771 --> 00:59:29.688
<v Josh Sparkes>So the peer can fill out the checklist
and send it back to the original</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32670-3
00:59:29.688 --> 00:59:32.735
<v Josh Sparkes>requester to see approved or not.
That's OK. Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32670-4
00:59:32.735 --> 00:59:35.020
<v Josh Sparkes>We weren't using yet. OK, good. Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32701-0
00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:43.024
<v Josh Sparkes>Right. That was a standard. Yeah,
that's not that's for all peer checks,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32701-1
00:59:43.024 --> 00:59:47.337
<v Josh Sparkes>for all last teams. That's it.
So and checklist and all that are all</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32701-2
00:59:47.337 --> 00:59:51.338
<v Josh Sparkes>available in spreadsheets.
So we can just handle that over when</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32701-3
00:59:51.338 --> 00:59:52.900
<v Josh Sparkes>you're ready. Cool. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32703-0
00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:55.580
<v Josh Sparkes>Inward flow.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32710-0
00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:01.660
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the other live check we have is
done after submission.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32772-0
01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:05.959
<v Josh Sparkes>So we check because it's so we run it
through our system.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32772-1
01:00:05.959 --> 01:00:11.133
<v Josh Sparkes>So it tracks all that information and it
uses an API and sends it directly to our</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32772-2
01:00:11.133 --> 01:00:14.287
<v Josh Sparkes>portals.
So we're just checking to make sure it's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32772-3
01:00:14.287 --> 01:00:18.198
<v Josh Sparkes>going to the right one. OK,
so it's not done in the workflow,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32772-4
01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:21.100
<v Josh Sparkes>it's done in the workflow you could say
it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32801-0
01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:27.530
<v Josh Sparkes>It's going and it goes to somebody else
to then check and they just won't check</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32801-1
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:32.134
<v Josh Sparkes>it. Is that someone else? OK,
so as part of the workflow,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32801-2
01:00:32.134 --> 01:00:36.340
<v Josh Sparkes>it's all then assigned to as part of the
next stage.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32832-0
01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:40.267
<v Josh Sparkes>Been done peer reviews, live,
live reviews,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32832-1
01:00:40.267 --> 01:00:45.735
<v Josh Sparkes>then you get another approval and that
one's it's not peer reviewed,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32832-2
01:00:45.735 --> 01:00:50.568
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just that's the other one at the end
and that's it. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32832-3
01:00:50.568 --> 01:00:53.500
<v Josh Sparkes>and that's within the e-billing team.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32848-0
01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:57.917
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
And then assuming that role could be like</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32848-1
01:00:57.917 --> 01:01:02.820
<v Josh Sparkes>manager role and then that's checked and
signed off.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32869-0
01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:07.550
<v Josh Sparkes>And at that point,
would you then consider the upload</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32869-1
01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:11.556
<v Josh Sparkes>process of that new to be closed,
complete, closed, complete,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32869-2
01:01:11.556 --> 01:01:13.300
<v Josh Sparkes>approved essentially, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32900-0
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:23.712
<v Josh Sparkes>So the the condition for it to either be
checked by somebody in the building team</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32900-1
01:01:23.712 --> 01:01:27.606
<v Josh Sparkes>or not. What was that?
What was the differentiator? Sorry,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32900-2
01:01:27.606 --> 01:01:30.180
<v Josh Sparkes>whether it was or not. Oh, auto submit.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32901-0
01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:33.380
<v Josh Sparkes>Let's be like.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32903-0
01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.340
<v Josh Sparkes>We have to have something on John.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32962-0
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:44.702
<v Josh Sparkes>Because they need to have to say that
they don't come to a submit. Yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32962-1
01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:50.697
<v Josh Sparkes>And then because we don't differentiate.
So what we find when we're in the QA that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32962-2
01:01:50.697 --> 01:01:55.465
<v Josh Sparkes>we need to sample PDF of those,
we need to sample these of those,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32962-3
01:01:55.465 --> 01:01:58.860
<v Josh Sparkes>but we don't,
we're not able to differentiate.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32991-0
01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:03.082
<v Josh Sparkes>And then apply tickets.
So to be able for the teams of the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32991-1
01:02:03.082 --> 01:02:07.675
<v Josh Sparkes>service, yeah, is there's a PDF,
is this a lead or is this an auto submit</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32991-2
01:02:07.675 --> 01:02:11.771
<v Josh Sparkes>to have them tick the box? Yep.
So we can differentiate that way.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32991-3
01:02:11.771 --> 01:02:15.060
<v Josh Sparkes>And then if it's auto submit,
it goes to like, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/32992-0
01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:15.300
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33036-0
01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:21.240
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's the other day,
then it's easier for you to and then you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33036-1
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:26.277
<v Josh Sparkes>are after the autism that you need then
need a confirmation that it's been done.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33036-2
01:02:26.277 --> 01:02:29.138
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.
So it doesn't even after autism that you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33036-3
01:02:29.138 --> 01:02:32.620
<v Josh Sparkes>still need that close complete. Yeah.
And who provides?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33074-0
01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:38.084
<v Josh Sparkes>That way you just get the clarification
from your submit. Is that right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33074-1
01:02:38.084 --> 01:02:43.841
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that system generated clarification or
who was it a person you physically go in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33074-2
01:02:43.841 --> 01:02:48.142
<v Josh Sparkes>and check that it's in.
So again prior to your submit code is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33074-3
01:02:48.142 --> 01:02:51.540
<v Josh Sparkes>complete,
it will be confirmation of submission.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33094-0
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:58.872
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. And then you can sign that off.
We we're on the same lines here that it's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33094-1
01:02:58.872 --> 01:03:03.340
<v Josh Sparkes>a manual selection of auto submit. Yes.
Yeah, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33145-0
01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:08.787
<v Josh Sparkes>What was that?
Because the requested I won't know.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33145-1
01:03:08.787 --> 01:03:12.506
<v Josh Sparkes>They won't know.
They won't know why at the agent level.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33145-2
01:03:12.506 --> 01:03:17.072
<v Josh Sparkes>But you'll be saying, yeah,
this is uploaded if it's I have submitted</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33145-3
01:03:17.072 --> 01:03:21.052
<v Josh Sparkes>this PDA for practice.
So then PDA leads after uploading the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33145-4
01:03:21.052 --> 01:03:24.509
<v Josh Sparkes>case first.
If it's possible to trigger something to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33145-5
01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:24.900
<v Josh Sparkes>lower.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33177-0
01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:31.207
<v Josh Sparkes>And then they have to check once they've
checked. Yeah, yeah. Or like for instance,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33177-1
01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:37.172
<v Josh Sparkes>other scenario that is that he needs to
check the leads and then that comes back</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33177-2
01:03:37.172 --> 01:03:40.780
<v Josh Sparkes>to me only once. So he's not. Yes. Yeah,
that's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33189-0
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:47.998
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, understood.
Clarified PDS are also live, correct? No,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33189-1
01:03:47.998 --> 01:03:50.820
<v Josh Sparkes>no, it's only auto submit.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33199-0
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:53.975
<v Mark Sedgey>And what's the?
Does anything different happen if it's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33199-1
01:03:53.975 --> 01:03:55.820
<v Mark Sedgey>rejected, if it's not approved?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33212-0
01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:02.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Almost three different types you're
saying, well, no.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33252-0
01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:04.605
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, just just across each of them.
So what happens?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33252-1
01:04:04.605 --> 01:04:07.534
<v Mark Sedgey>Does the does whoever it is that doesn't
approve it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33252-2
01:04:07.534 --> 01:04:12.121
<v Mark Sedgey>do we trigger them to put a statement as
to why? And then does the does something,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33252-3
01:04:12.121 --> 01:04:14.939
<v Mark Sedgey>you know,
what what's different for it to go round</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33252-4
01:04:14.939 --> 01:04:17.260
<v Mark Sedgey>again or does it just go back round again?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33255-0
01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:18.580
<v Mark Sedgey>What's the?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33298-0
01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:24.275
<v Josh Sparkes>It depends on the projection.
It's something that the team can fix.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33298-1
01:04:24.275 --> 01:04:28.105
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm doing live in the moment resubmitting
until it's accepted,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33298-2
01:04:28.105 --> 01:04:32.969
<v Josh Sparkes>but if it's something we need matter team
involved in or we need to talk to the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33298-3
01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:35.340
<v Josh Sparkes>client, we need to submit rate, that's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33335-0
01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:39.148
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
that's why we now we've always got to the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33335-1
01:04:39.148 --> 01:04:44.694
<v Josh Sparkes>point where this is this workflow Mark
has said this has gone through OK as the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33335-2
01:04:44.694 --> 01:04:49.893
<v Josh Sparkes>happy part and now probably Mark will
touch upon the rejection workflow of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33335-3
01:04:49.893 --> 01:04:52.180
<v Josh Sparkes>which we'll get into more detail.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33337-0
01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:54.100
<v Mark Sedgey>Was was I jumping the gun? Sorry.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33392-0
01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:56.656
<v Josh Sparkes>No, no, no. No, no,
you're perfectly timed to come into</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33392-1
01:04:56.656 --> 01:05:00.994
<v Josh Sparkes>rejection. We can some.
So even though it's been also submitted</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33392-2
01:05:00.994 --> 01:05:04.450
<v Josh Sparkes>at this point,
you can still get those rejections.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33392-3
01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:07.975
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's still not.
I said we've got close complete,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33392-4
01:05:07.975 --> 01:05:12.380
<v Josh Sparkes>but just as a activity,
so it could be that it's also submitted.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33432-0
01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:16.533
<v Josh Sparkes>Check done,
uploaded PDS and then this file's done.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33432-1
01:05:16.533 --> 01:05:22.955
<v Josh Sparkes>Now we've got to wait for the accepted or
rejection process to come in and that's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33432-2
01:05:22.955 --> 01:05:29.220
<v Josh Sparkes>probably timing mark for yourself as now
we're getting into the reasons for it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33476-0
01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:34.686
<v Josh Sparkes>I know we've touched upon it from some
pre-checks on the previous workflows,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33476-1
01:05:34.686 --> 01:05:39.659
<v Josh Sparkes>but now we have to sort of say, OK,
so we can also submit some of the same</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33476-2
01:05:39.659 --> 01:05:44.566
<v Josh Sparkes>reasons it's been rejected because of
rates matter all all of the type of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33476-3
01:05:44.566 --> 01:05:49.340
<v Josh Sparkes>invoices will have the same rejection
reason, if you agree with it, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33491-0
01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.901
<v Josh Sparkes>Let's check on the auto submit,
but two approvals.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33491-1
01:05:56.901 --> 01:06:01.211
<v Josh Sparkes>They're going to be two different people.
We should only have one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33491-2
01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:03.140
<v Josh Sparkes>There was one after it closed.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33510-0
01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:09.987
<v Josh Sparkes>No, it should just be one.
Once it's gone through and has submitted</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33510-1
01:06:09.987 --> 01:06:14.420
<v Josh Sparkes>the invoice, it doesn't get rechecked,
it gets post checked. Oh OK OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33518-0
01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:20.420
<v Josh Sparkes>It can't be the same person.
They can't Margaret.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33560-0
01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:25.768
<v Josh Sparkes>Can I just ask another question?
You were talking earlier, Megan,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33560-1
01:06:25.768 --> 01:06:30.220
<v Josh Sparkes>about the notification getting pushed to
either Peter or Lauren to do the check.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33560-2
01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:34.287
<v Josh Sparkes>Where does that happen? Just now?
Is that in Cherwell or does that happen</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33560-3
01:06:34.287 --> 01:06:36.926
<v Josh Sparkes>in? No,
I just send things to you in an e-mail.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33560-4
01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:37.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Cool. OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33585-0
01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:48.574
<v Josh Sparkes>But that could be part of the workflow of
the Simon group. Yeah, that's good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33585-1
01:06:48.574 --> 01:06:51.460
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good. Thank you. So for all.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33593-0
01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:53.420
<v Mark Sedgey>Parry's got his hand up, guys,
if you didn't know.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33586-0
01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:52.860
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33598-0
01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.700
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I didn't. I can't see you slowly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33663-0
01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:59.064
<v Parik Narain>Thank you. Thank you, Mark.
It's it's more of a on the rejection part,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33663-1
01:06:59.064 --> 01:07:01.525
<v Parik Narain>right.
And I can see that there are a lot of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33663-2
01:07:01.525 --> 01:07:05.847
<v Parik Narain>there might be might be a lot of ways you
want to handle a rejection and Mark,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33663-3
01:07:05.847 --> 01:07:09.785
<v Parik Narain>perhaps something for us to see whether
we can have a rejection reason.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33663-4
01:07:09.785 --> 01:07:13.340
<v Parik Narain>I think you mentioned that earlier as
well in in in the session.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33655-0
01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.260
<v Mark Sedgey>Yes, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33704-0
01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:17.916
<v Parik Narain>And the different different reasons can
then branch out in different activities</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33704-1
01:07:17.916 --> 01:07:22.434
<v Parik Narain>or instructions for for the person who's
now going to handle it again and then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33704-2
01:07:22.434 --> 01:07:26.037
<v Parik Narain>it's reportable as well.
So you can see how many requests were</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33728-0
01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:28.990
<v Mark Sedgey>So like a pick,
are you thinking of a a standard pick</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33704-3
01:07:26.037 --> 01:07:27.180
<v Parik Narain>rejected because of.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33728-1
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:33.508
<v Mark Sedgey>list and then from what's selected it
could trigger some tasks or something</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33711-0
01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:30.820
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33772-0
01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:35.239
<v Parik Narain>Correct. If yeah, yeah,
you have you have options now because</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33728-2
01:07:33.508 --> 01:07:34.340
<v Mark Sedgey>thereof? Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33772-1
01:07:35.239 --> 01:07:38.795
<v Parik Narain>obviously when you see ServiceNow
rejection and approval records are very,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33772-2
01:07:38.795 --> 01:07:41.876
<v Parik Narain>very simple. There's a state field,
there's a description field.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33772-3
01:07:41.876 --> 01:07:45.147
<v Parik Narain>It's not reportable as such.
You can just see how many of rejections</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33772-4
01:07:45.147 --> 01:07:48.180
<v Parik Narain>have occurred, but not the reason why.
What if we add a reason?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33802-0
01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:53.122
<v Parik Narain>Then it then gives us the flexibility to
either modify the flows later or and or</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33802-1
01:07:53.122 --> 01:07:57.646
<v Parik Narain>and also report the report the you know
the metrics etcetera around the reasons</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33802-2
01:07:57.646 --> 01:07:59.060
<v Parik Narain>it's a reason themselves.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33847-0
01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:03.039
<v Josh Sparkes>And we have that now in at the moment the
invoice level,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33847-1
01:08:03.039 --> 01:08:07.609
<v Josh Sparkes>that's how we're managing it and we can
see our volumes and you have a,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33847-2
01:08:07.609 --> 01:08:10.466
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean standard, you have like a tree.
Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33847-3
01:08:10.466 --> 01:08:13.323
<v Josh Sparkes>it's I don't know how many levels you go
to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33847-4
01:08:13.323 --> 01:08:18.020
<v Josh Sparkes>You just have one drop down or if you
pick one drop down, it's the other.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33880-0
01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:23.684
<v Josh Sparkes>Three main ones and then the sub ones
within three and then 8 categories we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33880-1
01:08:23.684 --> 01:08:27.087
<v Josh Sparkes>need.
I think that calls to what we were just</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33880-2
01:08:27.087 --> 01:08:33.228
<v Josh Sparkes>saying is that root cause analysis tree.
We've got three options at level 18 level</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33880-3
01:08:33.228 --> 01:08:33.820
<v Josh Sparkes>level 2.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33928-0
01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:37.336
<v Josh Sparkes>And then you can do that,
as Karen was saying,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33928-1
01:08:37.336 --> 01:08:42.706
<v Josh Sparkes>you can report upon that to get the
insights to correct downstream behaviour.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33928-2
01:08:42.706 --> 01:08:45.391
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
it's good that when I'm doing my</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33928-3
01:08:45.391 --> 01:08:49.246
<v Josh Sparkes>reporting is live information,
so if we're changing it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33928-4
01:08:49.246 --> 01:08:51.380
<v Josh Sparkes>I can't retrospectively see it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33974-0
01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:56.982
<v Josh Sparkes>So then if we have it,
you can see it right. These ones aren't.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33974-1
01:08:56.982 --> 01:09:01.118
<v Josh Sparkes>It has got a history,
but when you're reporting,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33974-2
01:09:01.118 --> 01:09:05.423
<v Josh Sparkes>it will just report the last slide.
So it doesn't.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33974-3
01:09:05.423 --> 01:09:11.500
<v Josh Sparkes>So you have to be able to see it right.
This was rejected. I'm keepers.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34032-0
01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:16.842
<v Mark Sedgey>So typically, typically in addition,
so typically on records if it's gone</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/33976-0
01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:13.300
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34032-1
01:09:16.842 --> 01:09:22.271
<v Mark Sedgey>round a number of times what you what
there's a and again I'm just presupposing</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34032-2
01:09:22.271 --> 01:09:25.664
<v Mark Sedgey>I'll I'll take Parekh's guidance on this
as well,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34032-3
01:09:25.664 --> 01:09:30.686
<v Mark Sedgey>but usually you'll track all the
approvals associated with that record in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34032-4
01:09:30.686 --> 01:09:31.500
<v Mark Sedgey>like I said.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34097-0
01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:34.317
<v Mark Sedgey>Separate tab near the bottom of the
record.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34023-0
01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:33.380
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34097-1
01:09:34.317 --> 01:09:39.140
<v Mark Sedgey>So what you can do is you can effectively
see how many iterations it's gone through,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34029-0
01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:35.100
<v Parik Narain>Mhm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34097-2
01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:43.453
<v Mark Sedgey>who went through the who did the reject
or approve, whichever is pertinent.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34097-3
01:09:43.453 --> 01:09:47.766
<v Mark Sedgey>But ultimately it gives you a bit of a
history of what's happened with that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34069-0
01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:45.780
<v Parik Narain>Correct.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34097-4
01:09:47.766 --> 01:09:51.340
<v Mark Sedgey>record and then what you can do is you
can report on how many.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34081-0
01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:49.220
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34128-0
01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:55.139
<v Mark Sedgey>Times do you go around something twice
because someone hasn't, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34128-1
01:09:55.139 --> 01:09:58.603
<v Mark Sedgey>some maybe a partner hasn't done the
right thing or some, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34128-2
01:09:58.603 --> 01:10:02.424
<v Mark Sedgey>so it enables you to do continuous
service improvement as a result of that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34122-0
01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:03.260
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34128-3
01:10:02.424 --> 01:10:02.780
<v Mark Sedgey>output.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34182-0
01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:07.207
<v Parik Narain>The among the challenge we have seen,
I mean approval process works quite</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34126-0
01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:05.260
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34182-1
01:10:07.207 --> 01:10:09.859
<v Parik Narain>nicely out-of-the-box,
but it also assumes the person approving</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34182-2
01:10:09.859 --> 01:10:12.469
<v Parik Narain>would put some detail in there.
We have seen it so many times,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34182-3
01:10:12.469 --> 01:10:15.660
<v Parik Narain>you know we have seen rejections and
teams don't know why something has been</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34182-4
01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.814
<v Parik Narain>rejected,
especially in a complex process like that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34182-5
01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:20.300
<v Parik Narain>if finance are involved and building are
involved etcetera.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34239-0
01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:24.599
<v Parik Narain>So what we have generally done is at
least given a drop down so that someone</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34172-0
01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:21.060
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34239-1
01:10:24.599 --> 01:10:28.649
<v Parik Narain>people don't have to tie things off as
they're rejecting at least to save their</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34239-2
01:10:28.649 --> 01:10:32.496
<v Parik Narain>two seconds or five seconds and we at
least have a very basic set of themes</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34239-3
01:10:32.496 --> 01:10:35.332
<v Parik Narain>around a process where the rejection
generally happens.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34290-0
01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:38.131
<v Mark Sedgey>So you're OK.
So let let me still play that. So,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34239-4
01:10:35.332 --> 01:10:37.660
<v Parik Narain>Maybe it's the value of a boy is not
correct.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34243-0
01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:39.940
<v Parik Narain>And we, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34290-1
01:10:38.131 --> 01:10:41.881
<v Mark Sedgey>so it might be, you know,
incorrect data as a pick list or some</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34290-2
01:10:41.881 --> 01:10:45.454
<v Mark Sedgey>something else and yeah,
or numbers don't match or whatever,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34251-0
01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:43.940
<v Parik Narain>Something like that, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34290-3
01:10:45.454 --> 01:10:48.794
<v Mark Sedgey>whatever that. So.
So you've got a standard one and then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34268-0
01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:48.420
<v Parik Narain>Correct, correct.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34290-4
01:10:48.794 --> 01:10:52.660
<v Mark Sedgey>maybe another and then if they select
other, it's free form text.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34327-0
01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:56.354
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yeah.
And then you can report on these.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34294-0
01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.420
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, understood.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34327-1
01:10:56.354 --> 01:11:00.036
<v Parik Narain>You can actually select them in tables,
break break these down, see how many,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34327-2
01:11:00.036 --> 01:11:03.576
<v Parik Narain>how many rejections in the billing
process were because of the wrong value</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34327-3
01:11:03.576 --> 01:11:06.220
<v Parik Narain>rather than just saying how many
rejections were there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34327-4
01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.580
<v Parik Narain>Does that help you narrow down the actual
issues?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34331-0
01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:11.740
<v Parik Narain>And that's quite,
quite powerful that that metric.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34381-0
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:16.134
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, well,
you can have your tree that is like</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34381-1
01:11:16.134 --> 01:11:19.785
<v Josh Sparkes>similar to today, not,
but you can also have that as they're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34381-2
01:11:19.785 --> 01:11:24.454
<v Josh Sparkes>saying inaccuracy data issues you know
and that become very team specific for</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34381-3
01:11:24.454 --> 01:11:28.404
<v Josh Sparkes>correction downstream. OK,
I think we'll agree that you know root</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34381-4
01:11:28.404 --> 01:11:29.900
<v Josh Sparkes>cause analysis trees are.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34424-0
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:35.112
<v Josh Sparkes>Very powerful.
It gives you that insight that the same</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34424-1
01:11:35.112 --> 01:11:40.099
<v Josh Sparkes>client issues or over a certain value
seems to be an issue,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34424-2
01:11:40.099 --> 01:11:45.585
<v Josh Sparkes>whatever it might be that can be
corrected. I think that's clear.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34424-3
01:11:45.585 --> 01:11:47.580
<v Josh Sparkes>So each of them will be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34453-0
01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:54.199
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll just go back to going going through
the uploads, checking rules, submit,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34453-1
01:11:54.199 --> 01:12:00.990
<v Josh Sparkes>auto submit and then at that point how
long between submitting and the rejection</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34453-2
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:01.660
<v Josh Sparkes>process?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34502-0
01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:08.210
<v Josh Sparkes>Is the time?
Is it almost once you're uploading it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34502-1
01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:14.087
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there a check or to these?
So if you want hours, days,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34502-2
01:12:14.087 --> 01:12:22.396
<v Josh Sparkes>it should be instantly on the screen or
it would be an e-mail notification coming</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34502-3
01:12:22.396 --> 01:12:22.700
<v Josh Sparkes>in.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34550-0
01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:26.126
<v Josh Sparkes>The volume's come in,
so right to get notifications if it's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34550-1
01:12:26.126 --> 01:12:30.149
<v Josh Sparkes>been accepted, if it's been rejected,
the portal will be almost instant.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34550-2
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:33.234
<v Josh Sparkes>But then if it's past that check and the
clients, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34550-3
01:12:33.234 --> 01:12:35.879
<v Josh Sparkes>if that's being stays month,
which stays month.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34550-4
01:12:35.879 --> 01:12:40.122
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's if it could remain open,
we would once we've got it in the system,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34550-5
01:12:40.122 --> 01:12:41.940
<v Josh Sparkes>it's then you'll be closed again.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34576-0
01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:46.216
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
because then theoretically it leads into</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34576-1
01:12:46.216 --> 01:12:52.030
<v Josh Sparkes>credit control to start chasing.
I'm just thinking of the workflow process,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34576-2
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:56.390
<v Josh Sparkes>Mark and Barry,
that close complete normal suggests that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34576-3
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:59.220
<v Josh Sparkes>it's close complete and non-editable.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34623-0
01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:04.595
<v Josh Sparkes>In the system later on where you've got
sort of closed submitted and therefore</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34623-1
01:13:04.595 --> 01:13:08.593
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not completely closed and if the
rejection comes in later,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34623-2
01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:13.028
<v Josh Sparkes>you can still add to that data,
but you're not actually acting upon it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34623-3
01:13:13.028 --> 01:13:16.900
<v Josh Sparkes>actively in your dashboards or having to
do anything with it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34648-0
01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:21.321
<v Josh Sparkes>Well, would you recommend that?
Because there could be some subsequent</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34648-1
01:13:21.321 --> 01:13:23.816
<v Josh Sparkes>data that's coming in from rejection from
the clients.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34648-2
01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:26.220
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that what you would want though,
Lauren? Because.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34706-0
01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:29.704
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
I want it closed and date of our of your</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34706-1
01:13:29.704 --> 01:13:32.544
<v Josh Sparkes>our books.
But what we're finding if we've got a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34706-2
01:13:32.544 --> 01:13:35.441
<v Josh Sparkes>rejection,
we're going to backtrack where it came</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34706-3
01:13:35.441 --> 01:13:40.020
<v Josh Sparkes>from and open it up and open up a new
ticket because at the moment it's closed</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34706-4
01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.091
<v Josh Sparkes>to a set much.
I don't want to open up a new ticket.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34706-5
01:13:43.091 --> 01:13:46.220
<v Josh Sparkes>We want to have the same issue.
This is what we have.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34697-0
01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:46.540
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah,
So what you want is link the records.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34747-0
01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:49.529
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
like the e-mail we talked about earlier,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34747-1
01:13:49.529 --> 01:13:52.580
<v Josh Sparkes>find the original e-mail,
go back on that e-mail,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34747-2
01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:56.792
<v Josh Sparkes>keep it in the same chain. Yes,
rather than opening up and trying to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34747-3
01:13:56.792 --> 01:13:59.904
<v Josh Sparkes>match where is this where exactly makes
it easier.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34747-4
01:13:59.904 --> 01:14:04.420
<v Josh Sparkes>But we can just close off your books as
an activity. Yeah, for reporting.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34751-0
01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:08.500
<v Josh Sparkes>But ability to link it when the rejection
comes in.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34817-0
01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:12.220
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, that's where I was going.
That's where I was going.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34767-0
01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:12.300
<v Josh Sparkes>As we talked about one of the other cases.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34817-1
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:16.097
<v Mark Sedgey>You want you want to be able to because
you might have two or three come,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34817-2
01:14:16.097 --> 01:14:19.136
<v Mark Sedgey>two or three activities associated with
that single item.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34817-3
01:14:19.136 --> 01:14:23.014
<v Mark Sedgey>But you want to be able to link the
records so that you've got your audit</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34817-4
01:14:23.014 --> 01:14:27.310
<v Mark Sedgey>trail without clouding or having you're
running the risk of someone changing some</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34817-5
01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:28.620
<v Mark Sedgey>data in the previous one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34824-0
01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:33.054
<v Mark Sedgey>When it's closed,
it's usually closed and then you just</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34824-1
01:14:33.054 --> 01:14:35.060
<v Mark Sedgey>link your associated records.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34842-0
01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:45.026
<v Josh Sparkes>And based on that,
so if I was a story of one client's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34842-1
01:14:45.026 --> 01:14:46.900
<v Josh Sparkes>multiple invoices.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34873-0
01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:53.053
<v Josh Sparkes>And the rejection happened on one invoice.
It could be one of many,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34873-1
01:14:53.053 --> 01:14:56.773
<v Josh Sparkes>but you might not know.
You might just get rejection and you have</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34873-2
01:14:56.773 --> 01:15:00.380
<v Josh Sparkes>to pick unpick all the invoices or do
they tend to tell you it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34876-0
01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:04.220
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34927-0
01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:08.523
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's known.
Just going back to your earlier point,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34927-1
01:15:08.523 --> 01:15:13.238
<v Josh Sparkes>one about you'll submit it and then it
goes to credit control to chase the the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34927-2
01:15:13.238 --> 01:15:17.296
<v Josh Sparkes>payment and stuff like that.
I know we haven't touched on this now.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34927-3
01:15:17.296 --> 01:15:21.593
<v Josh Sparkes>Are you guys scared to see it?
But we still use the e-bill and tracker.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34927-4
01:15:21.593 --> 01:15:23.980
<v Josh Sparkes>We use the old manual updates and stuff.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34975-0
01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.368
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so how then if credit control for example</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34975-1
01:15:27.368 --> 01:15:30.797
<v Josh Sparkes>are on ServiceNow,
can we look for ways to remove that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34975-2
01:15:30.797 --> 01:15:34.038
<v Josh Sparkes>spreadsheet?
And it's not necessarily an answer for</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34975-3
01:15:34.038 --> 01:15:37.093
<v Josh Sparkes>right now.
It's probably something that you guys</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/34975-4
01:15:37.093 --> 01:15:41.020
<v Josh Sparkes>haven't seen either,
but there is a working spreadsheet where.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35018-0
01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:45.012
<v Josh Sparkes>Lauren,
you might be better to talk about how you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35018-1
01:15:45.012 --> 01:15:47.674
<v Josh Sparkes>use it and who's in the spreadsheet,
etcetera,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35018-2
01:15:47.674 --> 01:15:52.206
<v Josh Sparkes>but how we can start to pull that audit
trail actually on ServiceNow if all the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35018-3
01:15:52.206 --> 01:15:54.811
<v Josh Sparkes>teams are in them,
especially the difference.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35018-4
01:15:54.811 --> 01:15:56.340
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've got even everyone.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35045-0
01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:01.541
<v Josh Sparkes>So the e-book history one that we can log
in through here once we've done our</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35045-1
01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:04.892
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice upload or it's rejected,
all our notes in it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35045-2
01:16:04.892 --> 01:16:06.940
<v Josh Sparkes>We run our report rejected daily.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35076-0
01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:11.639
<v Josh Sparkes>And do our work.
Credit control also have those fields in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35076-1
01:16:11.639 --> 01:16:14.409
<v Josh Sparkes>their report.
So when they're looking at their</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35076-2
01:16:14.409 --> 01:16:19.124
<v Josh Sparkes>portfolio, they will see our comments,
if it's been uploaded, if it's rejected,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35076-3
01:16:19.124 --> 01:16:20.420
<v Josh Sparkes>if we're told held in.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35116-0
01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:28.454
<v Josh Sparkes>I see it's like you mentioned on it says
on hold, is that right? So they'll be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35116-1
01:16:28.454 --> 01:16:34.517
<v Josh Sparkes>So then we have handled teams.
So invoice day, the date that it was sent,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35116-2
01:16:34.517 --> 01:16:38.940
<v Josh Sparkes>it's pending group approval.
So they'll look if it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35149-0
01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:44.935
<v Josh Sparkes>If we've not voted it and it's pending,
we assign it to credit control. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35149-1
01:16:44.935 --> 01:16:48.227
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's in V,
then you'll be asked to sit with the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35149-2
01:16:48.227 --> 01:16:51.067
<v Josh Sparkes>master, so they'll be able to identify.
OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35149-3
01:16:51.067 --> 01:16:54.100
<v Josh Sparkes>it'd be worth seeing those spreadsheets.
Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35182-0
01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:59.950
<v Josh Sparkes>Just something I think to be aware for
the credit control sessions as well,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35182-1
01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:04.824
<v Josh Sparkes>because it feels like something that I
feel there should be a solution in here</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35182-2
01:17:04.824 --> 01:17:08.033
<v Josh Sparkes>for it. I just,
I can't remember the detail enough,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35182-3
01:17:08.033 --> 01:17:12.660
<v Josh Sparkes>so we'll probably need to look at it
separately. Maybe a parking lot item.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35256-0
01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:20.846
<v Josh Sparkes>Particularly if they're chasing the
blimming and then there's a rejection,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35256-1
01:17:20.846 --> 01:17:25.471
<v Josh Sparkes>you know there is a rejection process
coming as well that they've got four</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35256-2
01:17:25.471 --> 01:17:28.493
<v Josh Sparkes>sides of of that even though it's been
uploaded.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35256-3
01:17:28.493 --> 01:17:33.427
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it just goes back to that point
Mark was making earlier around the work</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35256-4
01:17:33.427 --> 01:17:36.140
<v Josh Sparkes>notes versus the other notes that the
team.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35286-0
01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:38.685
<v Josh Sparkes>We can use internally and how we utilize
that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35286-1
01:17:38.685 --> 01:17:41.360
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it may be something we can help
with that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35254-0
01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:39.260
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35286-2
01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:45.399
<v Josh Sparkes>but I don't want to oversimplify it
because there is a lot of information in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35286-3
01:17:45.399 --> 01:17:48.860
<v Josh Sparkes>using parts in that spreadsheet that you
just need to look at it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35343-0
01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:52.383
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, the the, the key,
the key question is how, how read,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35343-1
01:17:52.383 --> 01:17:54.880
<v Mark Sedgey>you know,
what's the immediacy of that Intel?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35343-2
01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.385
<v Mark Sedgey>You want it either right up front on the
front of the record or front of the case,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35343-3
01:17:59.385 --> 01:18:03.618
<v Mark Sedgey>or is it something that you would want
someone going to read the notes to try</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35343-4
01:18:03.618 --> 01:18:06.658
<v Mark Sedgey>and find it?
The key point is that that text, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35343-5
01:18:06.658 --> 01:18:09.100
<v Mark Sedgey>all the time through the life of the
record.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35369-0
01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:13.245
<v Mark Sedgey>You can add additional comments to the
front to save someone wading through the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35369-1
01:18:13.245 --> 01:18:17.004
<v Mark Sedgey>notes if it's really pertinent,
but that's more about people and process,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35369-2
01:18:17.004 --> 01:18:19.900
<v Mark Sedgey>you know how you utilize that to get the
best out of it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35371-0
01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:23.580
<v Mark Sedgey>Make sense?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35374-0
01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.620
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, mhm. Yeah, that makes sense.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35400-0
01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:36.815
<v Josh Sparkes>Anything else on the upload workflow on
the rejection unhappy path? Yes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35400-1
01:18:36.815 --> 01:18:40.940
<v Josh Sparkes>happy path SLA.
I mean you've got 3 to 10 days.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35425-0
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:55.987
<v Josh Sparkes>Should be 3 days now. Three days. Yeah,
it's 100K hours, over 100K, 24 hours.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35425-1
01:18:55.987 --> 01:18:58.580
<v Josh Sparkes>And as part of.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35449-0
01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:03.644
<v Josh Sparkes>Three days, OK.
And that's all the invoices up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35449-1
01:19:03.644 --> 01:19:09.628
<v Josh Sparkes>So on that, well, it's not uploaded.
It's attempted upload. Oh yes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35449-2
01:19:09.628 --> 01:19:13.500
<v Josh Sparkes>it's all the yeah, initially attempted.
OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35472-0
01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:24.768
<v Josh Sparkes>And that three days,
if you get on a Friday, it's not,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35472-1
01:19:24.768 --> 01:19:29.058
<v Josh Sparkes>that's the working days, working days.
We've got till Tuesday, Wednesday.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35472-2
01:19:29.058 --> 01:19:31.260
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm working out. Yes, I'm working out.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35474-0
01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:34.700
<v Josh Sparkes>This will be double sure, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35475-0
01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:36.180
<v Josh Sparkes>Squish.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35482-0
01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:44.700
<v Josh Sparkes>We covered uploading having parts.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35537-0
01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:50.608
<v Josh Sparkes>The submission, the rejection.
I just see what else is.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35537-1
01:19:50.608 --> 01:19:54.391
<v Josh Sparkes>I knew I actually you had two different
files,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35537-2
01:19:54.391 --> 01:20:00.589
<v Josh Sparkes>actually lots of processes split them by
region. Yeah, they've got ODS file,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35537-3
01:20:00.589 --> 01:20:05.660
<v Josh Sparkes>the OS file and the PDF,
so they will combine processes which.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35574-0
01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:11.356
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we've got the rejection,
which we've covered. Sorry. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35574-1
01:20:11.356 --> 01:20:16.768
<v Josh Sparkes>Now in your, I think Tim,
you put a process that actually we were</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35574-2
01:20:16.768 --> 01:20:21.114
<v Josh Sparkes>going to discuss,
which I think actually your memory</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35574-3
01:20:21.114 --> 01:20:25.460
<v Josh Sparkes>discussed a lot,
but we'll pull it up on the screen.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35627-0
01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:29.581
<v Josh Sparkes>It was a complex process that was in the
workflows that probably had this</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35627-1
01:20:29.581 --> 01:20:33.131
<v Josh Sparkes>rejection process in it.
Now I think we can pull up that because</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35627-2
01:20:33.131 --> 01:20:37.663
<v Josh Sparkes>we have a quick deep break and I'll pull
it up and we can go through it unless you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35627-3
01:20:37.663 --> 01:20:40.393
<v Josh Sparkes>put it to memory.
But it was but I thought we can</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35627-4
01:20:40.393 --> 01:20:44.434
<v Josh Sparkes>incorporate it into the overall manage
invoice because it looks like some</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35627-5
01:20:44.434 --> 01:20:44.980
<v Josh Sparkes>rejection.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35646-0
01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:49.655
<v Josh Sparkes>Action person and maybe there's some
localizations that you can think of that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35646-1
01:20:49.655 --> 01:20:53.130
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we've covered.
I think a lot of that that could be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35646-2
01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:55.780
<v Josh Sparkes>handled by the managed invoice Oval
service.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35675-0
01:20:56.740 --> 01:21:01.261
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've got the submission,
the acceptance,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35675-1
01:21:01.261 --> 01:21:08.239
<v Josh Sparkes>the uploading and the rejection.
I think it just covers those anymore.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35675-2
01:21:08.239 --> 01:21:11.580
<v Josh Sparkes>So you have duplicate triplicates.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35680-0
01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:16.700
<v Josh Sparkes>Process rest of the world, UK,
Australia and.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35726-0
01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:22.974
<v Josh Sparkes>Unless there's some exceptions for
mobilizations for those processes that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35726-1
01:21:22.974 --> 01:21:27.526
<v Josh Sparkes>you can think of that can be covered,
but within the same workflow.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35726-2
01:21:27.526 --> 01:21:31.944
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the same with the organ stuff.
It all comes in the same way.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35726-3
01:21:31.944 --> 01:21:35.157
<v Josh Sparkes>So managing it depends on who's sending
it. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35726-4
01:21:35.157 --> 01:21:37.500
<v Josh Sparkes>so managing it is a global process.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35756-0
01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:44.885
<v Josh Sparkes>Because there was a lot of, yeah,
I think there were pieces, as I said, UK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35756-1
01:21:44.885 --> 01:21:52.003
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia, the rest of the world,
specific block of the process rather than,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35756-2
01:21:52.003 --> 01:21:55.700
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, and that's what I saw that it was.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35791-0
01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:01.296
<v Josh Sparkes>It seems to be maybe you had a ticket at
the moment, one per ticket,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35791-1
01:22:01.296 --> 01:22:04.815
<v Josh Sparkes>one per activity,
whereas this is a service with multiple.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35791-2
01:22:04.815 --> 01:22:09.170
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like that check leads like that's
part of the upload. Yes, exactly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35791-3
01:22:09.170 --> 01:22:13.465
<v Josh Sparkes>The checking and the validation and the
approval is all part of it. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35791-4
01:22:13.465 --> 01:22:14.180
<v Josh Sparkes>that's good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35834-0
01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:23.232
<v Josh Sparkes>Everyone has a there's a tracker
management one that's that will go in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35834-1
01:22:23.232 --> 01:22:28.607
<v Josh Sparkes>that doesn't go to show that's the
tracker that we're talking about.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35834-2
01:22:28.607 --> 01:22:32.736
<v Josh Sparkes>So we see them.
Is that part of the spreadsheet that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35834-3
01:22:32.736 --> 01:22:37.020
<v Josh Sparkes>we're talking about? Yes. OK,
that's like one session.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35866-0
01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:41.945
<v Josh Sparkes>Thursday in the morning and that's just
so maybe if we have a look at that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35866-1
01:22:41.945 --> 01:22:46.496
<v Josh Sparkes>we can incorporate that into this process,
which what you're saying is actually</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35866-2
01:22:46.496 --> 01:22:49.740
<v Josh Sparkes>captured here,
which is good that we can incorporate it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35866-3
01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:52.129
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I think it was showing you what the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35866-4
01:22:52.129 --> 01:22:54.860
<v Josh Sparkes>spreadsheet looks like. Yeah,
that's very good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35903-0
01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:59.623
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, make solutions.
There's the portal subscription fee</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35903-1
01:22:59.623 --> 01:23:03.096
<v Josh Sparkes>invoices.
I just want to see with those 59</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35903-2
01:23:03.096 --> 01:23:07.377
<v Josh Sparkes>subscriptions or however,
but would they be handled?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35903-3
01:23:07.377 --> 01:23:11.980
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't want to make that reference,
but as part of the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35940-0
01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:15.763
<v Josh Sparkes>Manage invoicing process. No,
that's handed separately.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35940-1
01:23:15.763 --> 01:23:20.049
<v Josh Sparkes>So it overcomes in two ways.
It overcomes directly from the portal</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35940-2
01:23:20.049 --> 01:23:23.376
<v Josh Sparkes>that will be mail us or it will come
through maybe.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35940-3
01:23:23.376 --> 01:23:28.302
<v Josh Sparkes>So what I have to do is I check the
invoice because we have the subscription</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35940-4
01:23:28.302 --> 01:23:31.500
<v Josh Sparkes>fee on the percentage of how much we've
uploaded.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35971-0
01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:37.514
<v Josh Sparkes>So double check that they're reporting or
they'll do it month and monthly</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35971-1
01:23:37.514 --> 01:23:41.599
<v Josh Sparkes>standardly.
So that will be an initial check for me</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/35971-2
01:23:41.599 --> 01:23:47.020
<v Josh Sparkes>that then goes on to someone in our IT
department for authorization.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36002-0
01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:51.829
<v Josh Sparkes>And then they will go and get paid by our
AP team. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36002-1
01:23:51.829 --> 01:23:58.264
<v Josh Sparkes>so they're not doing anything rather than
just check in to make sure it's valid,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36002-2
01:23:58.264 --> 01:24:02.156
<v Josh Sparkes>right. OK.
And based on if you have to check the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36002-3
01:24:02.156 --> 01:24:04.380
<v Josh Sparkes>percentage activity or your.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36021-0
01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:09.784
<v Josh Sparkes>They can see, yeah, they would.
They normally attach a spreadsheet and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36021-1
01:24:09.784 --> 01:24:14.620
<v Josh Sparkes>the invoices are not ready,
so I'll double check that that is OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36054-0
01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:18.977
<v Josh Sparkes>We'd want a way to pass that between the
teams.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36054-1
01:24:18.977 --> 01:24:23.531
<v Josh Sparkes>We've asked to do that rather than having
to raise a request. Yes, exactly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36054-2
01:24:23.531 --> 01:24:28.205
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just thinking that they are tasks
that are happening that can run between</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36054-3
01:24:28.205 --> 01:24:30.722
<v Josh Sparkes>you.
Can I just part that one because I'm</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36054-4
01:24:30.722 --> 01:24:31.980
<v Josh Sparkes>thinking about being.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36057-0
01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.540
<v Josh Sparkes>This is.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36065-0
01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:47.420
<v Josh Sparkes>And we've got a detail as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36101-0
01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:57.185
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it's on. Thank you.
I put some up and then I've got multiple</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36101-1
01:24:57.185 --> 01:25:01.980
<v Josh Sparkes>and then I'll put them on. Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36167-0
01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:07.690
<v Josh Sparkes>Then I think the other thing that would
be good to have a discussion around this</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36167-1
01:25:07.690 --> 01:25:12.126
<v Josh Sparkes>afternoon is the portal notifications,
particularly the ones that come in that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36167-2
01:25:12.126 --> 01:25:15.665
<v Josh Sparkes>you take no action on and how we can find
a solution for that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36167-3
01:25:15.665 --> 01:25:19.933
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've spoken to you about that,
but the guys can maybe talk a little bit</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36167-4
01:25:19.933 --> 01:25:22.460
<v Josh Sparkes>more about these will come in
automatically.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36216-0
01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:26.543
<v Josh Sparkes>And we don't really want that in cases if
we can identify that there's no action on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36216-1
01:25:26.543 --> 01:25:28.670
<v Josh Sparkes>them. Yeah,
we can't do that for all of them,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36216-2
01:25:28.670 --> 01:25:31.906
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't think at this point,
but there are some that we can identify.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36216-3
01:25:31.906 --> 01:25:35.419
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's just how we built some rooms.
I guess that's how we do it in share.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36216-4
01:25:35.419 --> 01:25:37.638
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
just now I don't know if there's a better</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36216-5
01:25:37.638 --> 01:25:40.180
<v Josh Sparkes>way in service now,
but I see there's rules around it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36217-0
01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:41.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36270-0
01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:46.781
<v Josh Sparkes>We tried our best to get those in place
and reduce the amount and part of still</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36270-1
01:25:46.781 --> 01:25:50.994
<v Josh Sparkes>loads that come in as in our.
So it would be good to discuss it just to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36270-2
01:25:50.994 --> 01:25:55.733
<v Josh Sparkes>see what we could potentially do and just
open the volume with those and what do</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36270-3
01:25:55.733 --> 01:26:00.238
<v Josh Sparkes>they what they will indicate what they've
got saying when every time invoice</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36270-4
01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:01.700
<v Josh Sparkes>changes hands so when we.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36296-0
01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:05.578
<v Josh Sparkes>The invoice it goes multiple reviewers at
the client side depending on value so</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36296-1
01:26:05.578 --> 01:26:09.063
<v Josh Sparkes>that it will give us some notification
every time it changes will be yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36296-2
01:26:09.063 --> 01:26:11.851
<v Josh Sparkes>once it's uploaded,
changing hands once it's been approved,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36296-3
01:26:11.851 --> 01:26:12.780
<v Josh Sparkes>once it's been paid.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36337-0
01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:19.088
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, round it.
We get a daily update of everything.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36337-1
01:26:19.088 --> 01:26:25.978
<v Josh Sparkes>These are all just general notifications
from the portal. We cannot turn those off.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36337-2
01:26:25.978 --> 01:26:31.310
<v Josh Sparkes>That's the challenge we have.
So then we can't fix that as we go</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36337-3
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:34.180
<v Josh Sparkes>through each portal and turn those.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36376-0
01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:39.225
<v Josh Sparkes>Notifications off in different levels,
but that's not a functionality that we're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36376-1
01:26:39.225 --> 01:26:42.605
<v Josh Sparkes>able to control.
What we're trying to do is not have the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36376-2
01:26:42.605 --> 01:26:45.986
<v Josh Sparkes>ones that they don't need to deal with,
even touch them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36376-3
01:26:45.986 --> 01:26:49.900
<v Josh Sparkes>They can go somewhere and just sit in a
mailbox or something, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36413-0
01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:52.965
<v Josh Sparkes>They don't need to commit and create
cases. No,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36413-1
01:26:52.965 --> 01:26:57.417
<v Josh Sparkes>we need some sort of like this solution.
They'll come on the same. They might.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36413-2
01:26:57.417 --> 01:27:02.038
<v Josh Sparkes>We can't backlist it because sometimes we
need them. Yes, it's really hard. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36413-3
01:27:02.038 --> 01:27:04.799
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
you can't build all stuff because you'll</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36413-4
01:27:04.799 --> 01:27:06.940
<v Josh Sparkes>always miss the one that you you need.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36428-0
01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:10.746
<v Josh Sparkes>And these are the rejection notifications,
aren't they?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36428-1
01:27:10.746 --> 01:27:15.629
<v Josh Sparkes>So these are so if this solution if
anything says approved projected paid,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36428-2
01:27:15.629 --> 01:27:16.540
<v Josh Sparkes>we need those.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36468-0
01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:24.064
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
if it's delivery notification or a change</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36468-1
01:27:24.064 --> 01:27:28.785
<v Josh Sparkes>of hands or there's time metrics we can
get daily,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36468-2
01:27:28.785 --> 01:27:36.098
<v Josh Sparkes>which is people still write down every
activity. Yeah, we don't want that one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36468-3
01:27:36.098 --> 01:27:39.060
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. So there's ones that we can.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36487-0
01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:42.676
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
look to be just with some sort of ruling.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36487-1
01:27:42.676 --> 01:27:46.865
<v Josh Sparkes>If we know the ones that you need to get
in, then coming in.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36487-2
01:27:46.865 --> 01:27:51.466
<v Josh Sparkes>But if there's other ones,
so if it can scan everything with time,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36487-3
01:27:51.466 --> 01:27:55.860
<v Josh Sparkes>like, yeah, subject mining,
probably coming from the same sign.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36537-0
01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:01.249
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that's the thing.
So you've got a subject match and I think</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36537-1
01:28:01.249 --> 01:28:04.406
<v Josh Sparkes>it's called.
So basically if the e-mail address is the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36537-2
01:28:04.406 --> 01:28:08.367
<v Josh Sparkes>same and the the subject the same or
something, something like that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36537-3
01:28:08.367 --> 01:28:12.844
<v Josh Sparkes>it merges into like the same case.
What's a nightmare for you guys, isn't it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36537-4
01:28:12.844 --> 01:28:15.140
<v Josh Sparkes>Because sometimes you have like 200 odd.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36577-0
01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:20.809
<v Josh Sparkes>Same thing within the one case,
but to market is read within the journal.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36577-1
01:28:20.809 --> 01:28:27.002
<v Josh Sparkes>You can you can only do it individually.
So we created a one step for the team to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36577-2
01:28:27.002 --> 01:28:31.382
<v Josh Sparkes>market read in bulk,
but it never works for use. So yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36577-3
01:28:31.382 --> 01:28:34.780
<v Josh Sparkes>it's painful.
We get rejection and it's 100.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36592-0
01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:44.117
<v Josh Sparkes>But we need it. Yeah, yeah,
but that because it's changed hands so</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36592-1
01:28:44.117 --> 01:28:51.300
<v Josh Sparkes>many times and whatnot. Just everything.
Oh, I see.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36602-0
01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:56.300
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, I can't like that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36629-0
01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:58.752
<v Mark Sedgey>Sorry, sorry folks, I I missed,
missed some of the responses from you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36629-1
01:28:58.752 --> 01:29:02.214
<v Mark Sedgey>ladies at the table.
I heard Josh sort of say, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36629-2
01:29:02.214 --> 01:29:06.404
<v Mark Sedgey>so the reasoning as to why you're getting
these are missed. Can you,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36629-3
01:29:06.404 --> 01:29:09.380
<v Mark Sedgey>would you mind just into the mic
repeating that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36632-0
01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:11.860
<v Mark Sedgey>As to what these are.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36652-0
01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:17.261
<v Josh Sparkes>Those rejection notifications,
so this one particular client will get</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36652-1
01:29:17.261 --> 01:29:20.780
<v Josh Sparkes>400 rejections on this one particular
invoice.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36657-0
01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:24.500
<v Mark Sedgey>Wow. And why is that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36671-0
01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:28.700
<v Josh Sparkes>It was. It was so we we can't.
We lost the portal. They don't know where.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36680-0
01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:35.540
<v Josh Sparkes>We're in a bit of an infinitely somehow
to stop it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36728-0
01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:40.282
<v Josh Sparkes>No, it's the portal.
You should be able to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36728-1
01:29:40.282 --> 01:29:45.997
<v Josh Sparkes>We can look to configure the the
matchings. It's more of a contains X,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36728-2
01:29:45.997 --> 01:29:50.102
<v Josh Sparkes>then include it in the case.
If it doesn't, don't.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36728-3
01:29:50.102 --> 01:29:56.300
<v Josh Sparkes>So can I just ask a quick question
regards portals? What do we mean by that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36770-0
01:29:56.700 --> 01:30:03.222
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's an online website that these
clients have decided that they want their</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36770-1
01:30:03.222 --> 01:30:07.006
<v Josh Sparkes>invoices to.
And is that large house space and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36770-2
01:30:07.006 --> 01:30:12.964
<v Josh Sparkes>external or is that an external to
external? There's third party vendors.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36764-0
01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:12.900
<v Mark Sedgey>It's not managed by us though, is it?
That's the point.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36770-3
01:30:12.964 --> 01:30:15.620
<v Josh Sparkes>They've gone with Johnson noises.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36773-0
01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:21.330
<v Josh Sparkes>Lexis Nexis.
Most all these tech companies are</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36773-1
01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:22.140
<v Josh Sparkes>problems.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36785-0
01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:28.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Just set up that products.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36801-0
01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:30.721
<v Mark Sedgey>It's almost like you're almost looking
for a suppression at the exchange,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36789-0
01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:30.060
<v Josh Sparkes>I.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36801-1
01:30:30.721 --> 01:30:33.231
<v Mark Sedgey>e-mail exchange. Almost.
If they're coming,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36801-2
01:30:33.231 --> 01:30:36.140
<v Mark Sedgey>I assume they're coming in on an e-mail,
are they?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36839-0
01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:43.418
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, you know, Alex's are client portals.
So it's the clients of purchased software</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36817-0
01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:43.100
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36839-1
01:30:43.418 --> 01:30:49.375
<v Josh Sparkes>tool from a third party,
many different third parties of e-billing</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36839-2
01:30:49.375 --> 01:30:53.820
<v Josh Sparkes>portals to help them manage their legal
invoices.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36880-0
01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:59.684
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't. We we have no control.
They set up their parameters on how they</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36880-1
01:30:59.684 --> 01:31:05.634
<v Josh Sparkes>want it to work and it can be individual
per client, right? And and we have no,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36857-0
01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:04.620
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36880-2
01:31:05.634 --> 01:31:11.510
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not like we can stand like I always
make a joke and say there's nothing E</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36880-3
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:13.220
<v Josh Sparkes>about E billing, right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36921-0
01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:17.422
<v Josh Sparkes>For us,
it's the most inefficient service that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36921-1
01:31:17.422 --> 01:31:23.774
<v Josh Sparkes>you could ever work with because we have
to configure our ways of working to each</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36892-0
01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:19.620
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36921-2
01:31:23.774 --> 01:31:28.345
<v Josh Sparkes>portal that exists,
but then within each portal to the way</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36921-3
01:31:28.345 --> 01:31:33.380
<v Josh Sparkes>that the client has configured it for
their particular criteria.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36946-0
01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:38.348
<v Josh Sparkes>That they want to accept or reject as a
legal bill,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36946-1
01:31:38.348 --> 01:31:45.417
<v Josh Sparkes>which can be down to we don't accept
commerce, we don't pay for research,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36946-2
01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:47.900
<v Josh Sparkes>we don't pay for whatever.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37006-0
01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:54.711
<v Mark Sedgey>We might have to,
we might have to sort of park that, get,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/36948-0
01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:51.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37006-1
01:31:54.711 --> 01:31:58.568
<v Mark Sedgey>get us up, you know,
get us up and running and then start to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37006-2
01:31:58.568 --> 01:32:01.539
<v Mark Sedgey>look at how you treat those when they
come in.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37006-3
01:32:01.539 --> 01:32:06.660
<v Mark Sedgey>Because I think I heard and I I'm going
to say the lady in black because I can't</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37006-4
01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:10.580
<v Mark Sedgey>see the detail at the table. Forgive me,
I heard you sort of.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37064-0
01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:14.713
<v Mark Sedgey>You're saying that, you know,
every so often there's one you do want to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37064-1
01:32:14.713 --> 01:32:18.213
<v Mark Sedgey>spot, so you don't want to stop them all.
But you, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37018-0
01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:16.540
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37064-2
01:32:18.213 --> 01:32:23.034
<v Mark Sedgey>you need some sort of treatment when it's
repeated of the same topic, same subject,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37064-3
01:32:23.034 --> 01:32:25.560
<v Mark Sedgey>same case reference or something like
that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37064-4
01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:27.740
<v Mark Sedgey>So we might that might be an exchange.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37103-0
01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:31.253
<v Mark Sedgey>Rule rather than anything we would do
perhaps on ServiceNow,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37103-1
01:32:31.253 --> 01:32:35.227
<v Mark Sedgey>but it would be something we should look
at. But maybe once you've got it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37081-0
01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:34.940
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37103-2
01:32:35.227 --> 01:32:37.929
<v Mark Sedgey>you know,
we've got you across and sort of running</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37103-3
01:32:37.929 --> 01:32:41.956
<v Mark Sedgey>on all the other bits because Cherwell
doesn't do anything for you on that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37103-4
01:32:41.956 --> 01:32:42.380
<v Mark Sedgey>does it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37151-0
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:46.754
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have, sorry,
I was just going to add to your point,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37151-1
01:32:46.754 --> 01:32:49.195
<v Josh Sparkes>Mark.
So we do have some rules set up in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37151-2
01:32:49.195 --> 01:32:53.601
<v Josh Sparkes>Cherwell and I think it's worth sharing
that right because we did do some</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37151-3
01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:58.424
<v Josh Sparkes>analysis on words and what's coming in
because you can't stop it from sender for</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37151-4
01:32:58.424 --> 01:32:58.900
<v Josh Sparkes>example.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37206-0
01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:02.283
<v Mark Sedgey>These I've just realised, sorry,
I've just joined.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37161-0
01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:03.580
<v Josh Sparkes>But we can do from Zender,
that's in the subject.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37206-1
01:33:02.283 --> 01:33:07.521
<v Mark Sedgey>Sorry my my sad little brains just joined
some dots up with something and Mark</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37206-2
01:33:07.521 --> 01:33:10.970
<v Mark Sedgey>Jones said.
These are some of the these are some of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37206-3
01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:16.540
<v Mark Sedgey>the e-mail boxes that get more that fire
stuff straight into Cherwell, aren't they?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37290-0
01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:20.233
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, uh-huh.
So this is stuff that just go straight</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37214-0
01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:21.140
<v Mark Sedgey>Yes, right. OK. Yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37290-1
01:33:20.233 --> 01:33:22.512
<v Josh Sparkes>through the green box and come straight
in.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37290-2
01:33:22.512 --> 01:33:26.189
<v Josh Sparkes>Some of them we have been able to
suppress by putting those particular</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37290-3
01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:28.779
<v Josh Sparkes>rules in.
So I think that's a starting point that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37290-4
01:33:28.779 --> 01:33:31.679
<v Josh Sparkes>we can share.
But we still have loads that come through</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37245-0
01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:30.860
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37290-5
01:33:31.679 --> 01:33:35.408
<v Josh Sparkes>the gates and what the guys are left
having to do is like tick them all</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37290-6
01:33:35.408 --> 01:33:37.220
<v Josh Sparkes>because it creates a case for them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37302-0
01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:39.940
<v Josh Sparkes>And then just close them with what we
call no action.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37348-0
01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:44.808
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah. So you know what we could do,
what we could do. And again, I I may,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37302-1
01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:42.460
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's sort of a closure reason that we
put on that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37348-1
01:33:44.808 --> 01:33:50.107
<v Mark Sedgey>I may at risk getting a a sort of virtual
kick under the table from Parik,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37348-2
01:33:50.107 --> 01:33:55.194
<v Mark Sedgey>but if you treat these as being like an
alert, right, we could do some.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37348-3
01:33:55.194 --> 01:33:59.220
<v Mark Sedgey>I'm pretty certain there's some if we
treated them like.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37337-0
01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:57.420
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37384-0
01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:02.708
<v Mark Sedgey>Event and alert rather than a
notification as such.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37384-1
01:34:02.708 --> 01:34:07.819
<v Mark Sedgey>Potentially we could we could do some
suppression rules against common common</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37355-0
01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:04.460
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37384-2
01:34:07.819 --> 01:34:13.060
<v Mark Sedgey>data fields such that you only get what?
Go on Parik. I'll shut up. Go on mate.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37442-0
01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:18.110
<v Parik Narain>No, you're right, Mark.
But what we'll do first is qualify which</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37442-1
01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:20.918
<v Parik Narain>of these 32 mailboxes actually have
useful stuff.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37442-2
01:34:20.918 --> 01:34:23.669
<v Parik Narain>Because Mark was Mark's gonna not not you,
Mark,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37442-3
01:34:23.669 --> 01:34:28.161
<v Parik Narain>the other Mark in that in that workshop,
Mark Jones. So yeah, So what we'll do,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37418-0
01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:26.721
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, Jonesy.
Jonesy's gonna have a look at it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37418-1
01:34:26.721 --> 01:34:27.300
<v Mark Sedgey>wasn't he?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37442-4
01:34:28.161 --> 01:34:32.540
<v Parik Narain>we'll catch up and find out and then we
can actually have that same solution.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37463-0
01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:36.442
<v Parik Narain>Not for all the 3232 mailboxes,
maybe five or six are important.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37506-0
01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:38.267
<v Mark Sedgey>Well, it's the ones that these,
it's the ones, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37463-1
01:34:36.442 --> 01:34:38.300
<v Parik Narain>We'll see, but technically, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37506-1
01:34:38.267 --> 01:34:43.223
<v Mark Sedgey>it's the ones that are pertinent to what
these guys need or or you know these</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37473-0
01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:42.780
<v Parik Narain>Right. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37506-2
01:34:43.223 --> 01:34:46.018
<v Mark Sedgey>folks need to be able to catch and
operate.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37506-3
01:34:46.018 --> 01:34:51.100
<v Mark Sedgey>But what we don't want is the multi,
the multi transmission of common data, so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37488-0
01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:46.540
<v Parik Narain>Bye, bye.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37498-0
01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:51.820
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37548-0
01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:54.821
<v Mark Sedgey>You know,
if it is a box that a pertinent box,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37548-1
01:34:54.821 --> 01:34:59.715
<v Mark Sedgey>tick one, yes, we want it. But then two,
how do we suppress when it's, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37548-2
01:34:59.715 --> 01:35:03.220
<v Mark Sedgey>when it's a, you know,
clearly a duplicate sort of thing?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37550-0
01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:04.940
<v Parik Narain>Correct. And yeah, and also.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37610-0
01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:07.040
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's going to need to be visible like
that at those two different levels</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37610-1
01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:11.120
<v Josh Sparkes>because there will be something that will
come in from those mailboxes with some of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37610-2
01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:13.792
<v Josh Sparkes>the wording on it that they do need to
take action on.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37575-0
01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:11.740
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37610-3
01:35:13.792 --> 01:35:17.580
<v Josh Sparkes>But we don't actually know that what
language is that would distinguish that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37589-0
01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:15.860
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37583-0
01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:15.220
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37610-4
01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:20.300
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's a bit of work going to do
around it I think.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37644-0
01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:23.454
<v Parik Narain>Definitely. And may I ask, these emails,
in your view,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37611-0
01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:21.140
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37644-1
01:35:23.454 --> 01:35:26.588
<v Parik Narain>are they structured emails or are they
like random formats?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37644-2
01:35:26.588 --> 01:35:29.618
<v Parik Narain>Because sometimes emails just come in a
big BLOB of text.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37662-0
01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:36.743
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, the structure. No,
they structure the generic automatic</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37644-3
01:35:29.618 --> 01:35:32.700
<v Parik Narain>Are these formatted emails which which is
well understood?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37681-0
01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:40.221
<v Parik Narain>Got it. That's OK. Yeah, let's,
we'll review those and then we'll come</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37662-1
01:35:36.743 --> 01:35:39.220
<v Josh Sparkes>emails by the same.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37681-1
01:35:40.221 --> 01:35:43.889
<v Parik Narain>back to you. What's the best way possible?
I think that Mark,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37681-2
01:35:43.889 --> 01:35:45.900
<v Parik Narain>that's the thing we can take back.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37677-0
01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:46.140
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37732-0
01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:50.370
<v Josh Sparkes>Being a sample of those,
I think that triggered my thank you Mark.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37732-1
01:35:50.370 --> 01:35:55.659
<v Josh Sparkes>I can say join the dots on alerts having
this probably from field service engineer</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37732-2
01:35:55.659 --> 01:36:00.310
<v Josh Sparkes>where they got alarms and they're
flapping like 100 minutes and then you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37732-3
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:02.540
<v Josh Sparkes>have to consolidate it into one so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37727-0
01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:03.340
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37747-0
01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:07.538
<v Josh Sparkes>If we treat it in that similar vein of
alert rather than case and then the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37747-1
01:36:07.538 --> 01:36:10.940
<v Josh Sparkes>consolidation,
it's something we can look at certainly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37773-0
01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:14.049
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, yeah, we'll see. We'll see.
Definitely.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37773-1
01:36:14.049 --> 01:36:16.219
<v Parik Narain>I'm sure that technical solution will
work,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37773-2
01:36:16.219 --> 01:36:19.670
<v Parik Narain>but we'll still come back to you on the
possible, possible, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37773-3
01:36:19.670 --> 01:36:21.100
<v Parik Narain>target solution for this one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37768-0
01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:19.860
<v Josh Sparkes>It.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37798-0
01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:26.296
<v Josh Sparkes>That same sort of thread with our portals
and now like the data security,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37798-1
01:36:26.296 --> 01:36:30.540
<v Josh Sparkes>we have on time access codes coming into
our mailbox a lot.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37811-0
01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:35.574
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know what.
So we just need the code copy and paste</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37811-1
01:36:35.574 --> 01:36:37.340
<v Josh Sparkes>so we can log into the portal.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37856-0
01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:44.316
<v Josh Sparkes>So you in order to go to the portal,
you have these access and security and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37856-1
01:36:44.316 --> 01:36:50.451
<v Josh Sparkes>are they like one time authorization,
one time codes that will go through as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37856-2
01:36:50.451 --> 01:36:54.116
<v Josh Sparkes>well,
but they normally go to the least close</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37856-3
01:36:54.116 --> 01:36:57.940
<v Josh Sparkes>direction. OK,
that's part of the notification.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37857-0
01:36:58.020 --> 01:36:58.500
<v Josh Sparkes>I love this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37911-0
01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:03.892
<v Josh Sparkes>So a lot of the thinking has been done
around the suppression already,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37911-1
01:37:03.892 --> 01:37:06.296
<v Josh Sparkes>it sounds like.
So we could start with that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37911-2
01:37:06.296 --> 01:37:09.607
<v Josh Sparkes>I wouldn't say a lot of it.
I think we tried to do it and for</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37911-3
01:37:09.607 --> 01:37:13.399
<v Josh Sparkes>whatever reason it was quite difficult
for us to siphon that language,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37911-4
01:37:13.399 --> 01:37:17.885
<v Josh Sparkes>but we did manage to do it for some of it,
but there's still quite a lot that comes</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37911-5
01:37:17.885 --> 01:37:19.700
<v Josh Sparkes>through, so all right, understood.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37962-0
01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:22.513
<v Mark Sedgey>I think,
I think the important thing on that one,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37962-1
01:37:22.513 --> 01:37:26.240
<v Mark Sedgey>Josh, is that even if we,
even if we don't solve it 100%,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37962-2
01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:31.381
<v Mark Sedgey>we might be able to get close that we
reduce some of it and then it's something</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37962-3
01:37:31.381 --> 01:37:35.750
<v Mark Sedgey>we can refine rules over time and look to
see how we can, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37942-0
01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:33.820
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37962-4
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:39.220
<v Mark Sedgey>whether it's a fast follow from an
initial let's get.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37993-0
01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:42.104
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, let's make sure we can at least,
you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37993-1
01:37:42.104 --> 01:37:46.625
<v Mark Sedgey>replicate and catch and reduce and then
look to how we refine later. You know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37993-2
01:37:46.625 --> 01:37:51.259
<v Mark Sedgey>that's that's where my head would be on
this one because it's going to be tricky</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37993-3
01:37:51.259 --> 01:37:52.060
<v Mark Sedgey>to do clearly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38053-0
01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:58.026
<v Mark Sedgey>And part of why I'm saying that is
because we have no control on the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/37994-0
01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:54.700
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38053-1
01:37:58.026 --> 01:38:03.054
<v Mark Sedgey>upstream systems generating the, you know,
the, the, the emails, right. So,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38013-0
01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:01.100
<v Parik Narain>That's fine.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38053-2
01:38:03.054 --> 01:38:07.487
<v Mark Sedgey>so some of it will be well,
we've almost got to learn what are the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38053-3
01:38:07.487 --> 01:38:12.780
<v Mark Sedgey>common strings of text or strings of
items and then you know, how do we almost.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38032-0
01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:08.700
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38068-0
01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:15.652
<v Mark Sedgey>The opposite.
What are the ones we want to catch?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38068-1
01:38:15.652 --> 01:38:18.265
<v Mark Sedgey>What wording are in the ones that we want
to catch?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38068-2
01:38:18.265 --> 01:38:21.580
<v Mark Sedgey>And then kind of suppress the rest.
It's almost doing it reverse.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38107-0
01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:27.278
<v Josh Sparkes>And and I think it's coming up with what
we do with the ones that do still keep</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38070-0
01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:23.500
<v Mark Sedgey>Uh yo.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38107-1
01:38:27.278 --> 01:38:31.893
<v Josh Sparkes>coming through because you have to
recognise we're not going to solve it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38107-2
01:38:31.893 --> 01:38:34.864
<v Josh Sparkes>100%.
So is there a quick way we can deal with</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38097-0
01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:32.220
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38114-0
01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:37.966
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah,
like doing auto close or auto catch and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38107-3
01:38:34.864 --> 01:38:35.180
<v Josh Sparkes>them?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38114-1
01:38:37.966 --> 01:38:39.980
<v Mark Sedgey>close or something, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38117-0
01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:41.260
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38119-0
01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:46.300
<v Josh Sparkes>Point.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38161-0
01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:56.270
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, on that notification point, yeah,
less sample of those will have a be very</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38161-1
01:38:56.270 --> 01:39:00.293
<v Josh Sparkes>useful.
Is there anything else on notifications?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38161-2
01:39:00.293 --> 01:39:04.644
<v Josh Sparkes>We talked broadly on what we don't want.
We do want,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38161-3
01:39:04.644 --> 01:39:08.420
<v Josh Sparkes>I guess it's going to be covered by what
the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38163-0
01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:10.380
<v Josh Sparkes>We do want exercise, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38209-0
01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:16.121
<v Josh Sparkes>And then give them a quick break.
I'll pull up that complex workflow and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38209-1
01:39:16.121 --> 01:39:19.204
<v Josh Sparkes>remind everybody and then we can work
through it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38209-2
01:39:19.204 --> 01:39:23.458
<v Josh Sparkes>It might be that we've covered,
it might have been the localisation,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38209-3
01:39:23.458 --> 01:39:28.020
<v Josh Sparkes>but I think it mainly came from the
rejection process before perhaps the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38219-0
01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:31.838
<v Josh Sparkes>Whether that is something that we can
operate into this main service that we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38219-1
01:39:31.838 --> 01:39:32.780
<v Josh Sparkes>talked about today.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38248-0
01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:37.187
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So then there's also the other one we put</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38248-1
01:39:37.187 --> 01:39:40.791
<v Josh Sparkes>to the side. What was it?
The subscription fee one,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38248-2
01:39:40.791 --> 01:39:46.059
<v Josh Sparkes>whether that's going to be part of the
service or that's the AP one for the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38248-3
01:39:46.059 --> 01:39:48.900
<v Josh Sparkes>portal. Yeah, fees. Yeah, we've got that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38252-0
01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:52.940
<v Josh Sparkes>All right, I'll tidy that up later.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38261-0
01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:01.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, that's the voice thing.
And then I think.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38288-0
01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:07.810
<v Josh Sparkes>So one more on service.
I just want TQ on the recommendation.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38288-1
01:40:07.810 --> 01:40:13.631
<v Josh Sparkes>We've done the final onboarding time
keeper rate. I think that's it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38288-2
01:40:13.631 --> 01:40:18.860
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we've covered a lot of accruals.
We did that support.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38334-0
01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:25.561
<v Josh Sparkes>On the one of those and then I suppose
there was the admin,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38334-1
01:40:25.561 --> 01:40:29.044
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we covered on the e-billing side
as well,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38334-2
01:40:29.044 --> 01:40:33.503
<v Josh Sparkes>which comes under some client onboarding,
changing information,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38334-3
01:40:33.503 --> 01:40:38.380
<v Josh Sparkes>but I don't know whether there's any
additional activity that you do.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38338-0
01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:42.540
<v Josh Sparkes>On the on any of the portals that we need
to capture.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38353-0
01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:50.973
<v Josh Sparkes>Think that your activity is just rates,
client, client creation, client change,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38353-1
01:40:50.973 --> 01:40:53.340
<v Josh Sparkes>time and keeper rates invoice.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38355-0
01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:55.260
<v Josh Sparkes>Right.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38365-0
01:40:56.980 --> 01:41:00.949
<v Josh Sparkes>We do have to do some matter.
We do have to do some matter.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38365-1
01:41:00.949 --> 01:41:05.513
<v Josh Sparkes>Some other admin in the portal,
so they were tracking have to submit</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38365-2
01:41:05.513 --> 01:41:07.100
<v Josh Sparkes>status for this project.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38380-0
01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:14.028
<v Josh Sparkes>So I don't think we have any processes
that maybe we can capture. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38380-1
01:41:14.028 --> 01:41:17.500
<v Josh Sparkes>that's admin. Yeah,
that would be triggered for me.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38387-0
01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:23.860
<v Josh Sparkes>Let me trigger still 50% of the like.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38410-0
01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:27.714
<v Josh Sparkes>The notification, yeah,
where it'll be from.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38410-1
01:41:27.714 --> 01:41:31.216
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm not sure it's going.
Can you can you do this?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38410-2
01:41:31.216 --> 01:41:36.700
<v Josh Sparkes>So that could be through a request and is
that map, would that come under my cell?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38432-0
01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:44.140
<v Josh Sparkes>But would that be covered by a separate
team or that that comes into you as well?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38432-1
01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:49.180
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, OK, on the NPO just now, Lauren.
Matter admins on the NPO.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38477-0
01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:52.897
<v Josh Sparkes>No,
I think that's why it will not be there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38477-1
01:41:52.897 --> 01:41:55.187
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
that's why I think it's one of those</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38477-2
01:41:55.187 --> 01:41:57.797
<v Josh Sparkes>processes that you can come down to
queries. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38477-3
01:41:57.797 --> 01:42:02.165
<v Josh Sparkes>that's maybe a good point actually still
to be queries queries and have everybody</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38477-4
01:42:02.165 --> 01:42:05.946
<v Josh Sparkes>deal with those. Yeah, OK, yeah,
across the board, have a quick break,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38477-5
01:42:05.946 --> 01:42:09.994
<v Josh Sparkes>pull up that complex process and then
we'll work on them and they come into</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38477-6
01:42:09.994 --> 01:42:10.420
<v Josh Sparkes>queries.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38485-0
01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:16.330
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that Sue? Yeah. Yeah. Quick, quick.
And three and two or three, three, three,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38485-1
01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:18.300
<v Josh Sparkes>three. We haven't got time.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38484-0
01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:19.180
<v Mark Sedgey>Back at 3:00.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38488-0
01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:20.940
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38489-0
01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:21.340
<v Mark Sedgey>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38500-0
01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:27.660
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's 16511.
Was it your NTL process?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38528-0
01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:38.560
<v Josh Sparkes>Are you serious?
If you go under the is it in the the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38528-1
01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:46.780
<v Josh Sparkes>shared area? It's in the shared area,
complex folder.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38537-0
01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:55.734
<v Josh Sparkes>They could test me whether it was 165.
There is a 165 or one in there.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38537-1
01:42:55.734 --> 01:43:01.180
<v Josh Sparkes>Who is that? Yeah,
you could be a satellite.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38543-0
01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.020
<v Josh Sparkes>There you go, this one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38561-0
01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:19.442
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it's the school perhaps. Oh, right.
I've never been in here before.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38561-1
01:43:19.442 --> 01:43:24.620
<v Josh Sparkes>You're not looking at this period,
not this one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38568-0
01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:29.500
<v Josh Sparkes>I looked through some of the complex ones,
but you know we'd go through it here.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38603-0
01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:37.519
<v Josh Sparkes>It might be,
but you've already done what they said.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38603-1
01:43:37.519 --> 01:43:41.503
<v Josh Sparkes>This is kind of loaded and then you've
got the rejections,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38603-2
01:43:41.503 --> 01:43:45.689
<v Josh Sparkes>which is the book category,
the different rejections on them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38603-3
01:43:45.689 --> 01:43:49.065
<v Josh Sparkes>All right, yeah,
so it might be as simple as that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38603-4
01:43:49.065 --> 01:43:49.740
<v Josh Sparkes>rejection.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38627-0
01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:55.505
<v Josh Sparkes>Receive rejection assigned.
Can you see it better on that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38627-1
01:43:55.505 --> 01:44:01.283
<v Josh Sparkes>I can timekeeper rates incorrect billing.
Yeah, it looks like it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38627-2
01:44:01.283 --> 01:44:05.660
<v Josh Sparkes>But you think the the happy path is same
as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38640-0
01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:12.861
<v Josh Sparkes>That's fine. That's fine. Yeah,
it looks like it. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38640-1
01:44:12.861 --> 01:44:15.580
<v Josh Sparkes>not bad for a complex.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38663-0
01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:21.859
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So I've been pasting.
I've already rolled.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38663-1
01:44:21.859 --> 01:44:26.124
<v Josh Sparkes>I've been taken as a whole.
I've been broken out, haven't I? Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38663-2
01:44:26.124 --> 01:44:30.198
<v Josh Sparkes>So when you look at this,
that the like subcategory, it's like,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38663-3
01:44:30.198 --> 01:44:33.380
<v Josh Sparkes>it's straightforward. Yeah,
that's what you mean.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38676-0
01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:43.055
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you want a charge? Are you OK?
15 minutes. There is one charge.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38676-1
01:44:43.055 --> 01:44:45.220
<v Josh Sparkes>So I switch around.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38685-0
01:44:51.300 --> 01:45:08.620
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I'm just going to the house, yes.
Was it the right one?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38689-0
01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:16.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, sorry, the number.
I thought you meant the. No, I'm not sure.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38698-0
01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:28.836
<v Josh Sparkes>What was the number you thought 165.11?
Yeah, that's what it is. Subcategories.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38698-1
01:45:28.836 --> 01:45:35.100
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good to make them perfectly in
order.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38700-0
01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:42.260
<v Josh Sparkes>Thanks.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38709-0
01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:50.620
<v Josh Sparkes>No, I'm OK. Thanks.
I might do in a second.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38714-0
01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:53.740
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just gonna then consolidate all those.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38725-0
01:45:55.540 --> 01:46:01.900
<v Josh Sparkes>E billing ones in to manage. Yeah, great.
Yeah, well done.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38756-0
01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:10.498
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, I see. Yeah.
But you're getting into the the flow with</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38756-1
01:46:10.498 --> 01:46:16.940
<v Josh Sparkes>them. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Fantastic. OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38772-0
01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:36.140
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't think.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38783-0
01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:50.106
<v Josh Sparkes>I was thinking that's good budget.
So that's I mean all, all,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38783-1
01:46:50.106 --> 01:46:54.389
<v Josh Sparkes>all we have to do is make it capability
itself. It's how do you,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38783-2
01:46:54.389 --> 01:46:57.420
<v Josh Sparkes>how do we close that,
people who initiate it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38815-0
01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:16.700
<v Josh Sparkes>But this is an opportunity to talk to and
it seems like one of the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38819-0
01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:20.023
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
it's not like a thing you can do</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38819-1
01:47:20.023 --> 01:47:20.860
<v Josh Sparkes>everything.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38831-0
01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:42.620
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it has something like this.
It's not something that's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38833-0
01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:45.780
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38857-0
01:47:48.940 --> 01:48:05.380
<v Josh Sparkes>Was everyone doing it going on?
Doesn't that review like review?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38888-0
01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:18.287
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, that's that's a. That's really clear.
I go back to the system that's getting it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38888-1
01:48:18.287 --> 01:48:23.460
<v Josh Sparkes>but it should be.
It's a new version of three.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38916-0
01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:28.917
<v Josh Sparkes>That's the only thing again,
the new version of 3E,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38916-1
01:48:28.917 --> 01:48:32.339
<v Josh Sparkes>the biller arrangement,
they're raising the involves,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38916-2
01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:36.206
<v Josh Sparkes>they look at the projects and if it's
already in the system,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38916-3
01:48:36.206 --> 01:48:41.340
<v Josh Sparkes>they will plan what because our E billing
does that next year's version is 2027.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38928-0
01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:49.580
<v Josh Sparkes>That's your bill. It's in fact, he's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38935-0
01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:56.500
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm seeing that you're definitely.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38954-0
01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:17.900
<v Josh Sparkes>So you have somebody to say.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38972-0
01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:36.166
<v Josh Sparkes>I think this is the only point that the
guys are having to go through that sort</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/38972-1
01:49:36.166 --> 01:49:38.180
<v Josh Sparkes>of stuff.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39011-0
01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:44.713
<v Josh Sparkes>It means it can be close space for
something. Exactly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39011-1
01:49:44.713 --> 01:49:52.456
<v Josh Sparkes>So now it's just back to them.
Is that it's exactly gone's point.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39011-2
01:49:52.456 --> 01:49:55.740
<v Josh Sparkes>She can then take that to J.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39027-0
01:49:56.220 --> 01:50:08.180
<v Josh Sparkes>Does that all come about in the next year
or included in the?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39046-0
01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:16.120
<v Josh Sparkes>It's more rules than the other.
That's good. My so much is involved.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39046-1
01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:20.480
<v Josh Sparkes>Absolutely, yeah.
And so he's got a lot of requirements to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39046-2
01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:24.028
<v Josh Sparkes>be selling. Thank you.
It's all done by Claude.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39046-3
01:50:24.028 --> 01:50:26.540
<v Josh Sparkes>So what's what we need to comment?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39052-0
01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:32.180
<v Josh Sparkes>Like, right. Check.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39060-0
01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:39.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Terms, I think.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39061-0
01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:49.820
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39068-0
01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:11.580
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry, what do you say? What do you say?
Yeah, I'm good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39105-0
01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:22.833
<v Josh Sparkes>I think they've deemed it non acute.
I don't know what it has been,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39105-1
01:51:22.833 --> 01:51:30.091
<v Josh Sparkes>but now it is. Look, it's good.
Everyone's in the room.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39105-2
01:51:30.091 --> 01:51:33.460
<v Josh Sparkes>We just with our business.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39116-0
01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:51.940
<v Josh Sparkes>To do it, which you look,
that's my headstone in the grounds.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39118-0
01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:56.020
<v Josh Sparkes>That was more than last,
but now we need some.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39122-0
01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:04.020
<v Josh Sparkes>That cemetery. Yes, and not the giraffe.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39123-0
01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:06.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39146-0
01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:20.953
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.
Let me show this is what it looks like in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39146-1
01:52:20.953 --> 01:52:21.940
<v Josh Sparkes>my inbox.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39176-0
01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:34.949
<v Josh Sparkes>Because when Mark reminds me about the
lengths that we still have hundreds of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39176-1
01:52:34.949 --> 01:52:39.544
<v Josh Sparkes>pounds that you don't even allow one to
anything,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39176-2
01:52:39.544 --> 01:52:46.620
<v Josh Sparkes>a balance or useful activity and it
sounds very similar to the notification.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39178-0
01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:50.580
<v Josh Sparkes>And sometimes when this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39197-0
01:52:51.940 --> 01:53:05.860
<v Josh Sparkes>As they come into your inbox or in the
inbox that you I can see.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39209-0
01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:13.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Plus,
we're just looking at all the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39209-1
01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:16.100
<v Josh Sparkes>notifications. Oh, fantastic. Thank you.
You're welcome.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39251-0
01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:21.848
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, OK. So that's my dashboard,
in other words. OK, so that's mine.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39251-1
01:53:21.848 --> 01:53:26.011
<v Josh Sparkes>That's how many cases I saw,
how many as soon as we got to work on the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39251-2
01:53:26.011 --> 01:53:28.767
<v Josh Sparkes>progress,
that would be an unmade journal that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39251-3
01:53:28.767 --> 01:53:32.343
<v Josh Sparkes>would be, you know,
that somebody's that's been finalized to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39251-4
01:53:32.343 --> 01:53:36.565
<v Josh Sparkes>the line to have a look at, but yeah,
and that's all the cases that was</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39251-5
01:53:36.565 --> 01:53:37.620
<v Josh Sparkes>currently sitting.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39294-0
01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:42.293
<v Josh Sparkes>And then I can sort of be able to retray
and I can check.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39294-1
01:53:42.293 --> 01:53:47.519
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you want to see all you can,
you can see all that. So yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39294-2
01:53:47.519 --> 01:53:53.774
<v Josh Sparkes>at the moment there's 38 emails that
needs to be assigned and then the rest of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39294-3
01:53:53.774 --> 01:53:57.020
<v Josh Sparkes>them is like that one's just approved so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39349-0
01:53:57.780 --> 01:54:00.558
<v Josh Sparkes>So need to go in there.
Normally the invoice number,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39349-1
01:54:00.558 --> 01:54:04.278
<v Josh Sparkes>they they're busy with a clue.
So this is a clue notifications that we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39349-2
01:54:04.278 --> 01:54:07.474
<v Josh Sparkes>don't actually need,
but there would be an invoice number on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39349-3
01:54:07.474 --> 01:54:10.147
<v Josh Sparkes>there. And yeah,
that's a clue because it's a bit.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39349-4
01:54:10.147 --> 01:54:13.814
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just, you know, you know, yeah,
I think that at least I suppose,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39349-5
01:54:13.814 --> 01:54:17.220
<v Josh Sparkes>which was an application.
So obviously it wasn't done sometimes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39388-0
01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:22.430
<v Josh Sparkes>And then just so they would be an invoice
number and then you would take the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39388-1
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:27.560
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice and you're going to see and use
that ticket number and mark it as an</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39388-2
01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:32.490
<v Josh Sparkes>approved and then assign it as an
approval and then close the ticket. OK,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39388-3
01:54:32.490 --> 01:54:36.020
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, still going to three, yeah, yeah.
So we go to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39391-0
01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:45.740
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I'm still.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39400-0
01:54:47.580 --> 01:55:03.340
<v Josh Sparkes>What? What point? That point's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39419-0
01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:06.607
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so I'm going to just assume that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39419-1
01:55:06.607 --> 01:55:13.071
<v Josh Sparkes>somebody's done it or we would be.
We were just looking to change someone's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39419-2
01:55:13.071 --> 01:55:19.364
<v Josh Sparkes>done the checklist because you don't get
the minutes on boarding uploads.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39419-3
01:55:19.364 --> 01:55:21.660
<v Josh Sparkes>So useful that's checklist.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39438-0
01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:44.236
<v Josh Sparkes>We can pop that as well.
It's very anxiously. It's to show us. Yes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39438-1
01:55:44.236 --> 01:55:46.900
<v Josh Sparkes>that's true.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39460-0
01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:52.691
<v Josh Sparkes>They want it as simple as clean as
possible,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39460-1
01:55:52.691 --> 01:56:02.486
<v Josh Sparkes>so I'm quite conscious of that activity
that yeah, rather than if it adds to that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39460-2
01:56:02.486 --> 01:56:04.020
<v Josh Sparkes>if it's just.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39504-0
01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:09.252
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, you can try. I'll try anyways.
Yes. So at the moment,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39504-1
01:56:09.252 --> 01:56:14.564
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just flexing today and another
returns. I said, like, we see.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39504-2
01:56:14.564 --> 01:56:19.394
<v Josh Sparkes>I can't see at all what it's about.
We don't see the China.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39504-3
01:56:19.394 --> 01:56:23.740
<v Josh Sparkes>I can't see anything.
So I literally need to open it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39534-0
01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:28.006
<v Josh Sparkes>Right. It takes, but it takes this time.
And then yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39534-1
01:56:28.006 --> 01:56:33.523
<v Josh Sparkes>it's attachments that I know to go.
So just like these are the waiting for,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39534-2
01:56:33.523 --> 01:56:38.097
<v Josh Sparkes>it's more information.
So that's an e-mail that came in. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39534-3
01:56:38.097 --> 01:56:42.380
<v Josh Sparkes>but I use it as a demo too. Yes,
it's what I need to open.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39557-0
01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:58.220
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm going to take going to and then I'll
take December, then go to my sister.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39593-0
01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:02.730
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes,
I would make a note of it at the bottom.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39593-1
01:57:02.730 --> 01:57:09.663
<v Josh Sparkes>Please upload it and then I would say
please upload it and then whoever's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39593-2
01:57:09.663 --> 01:57:16.220
<v Josh Sparkes>uploaded it's the responsible people his
name and then the news from.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39618-0
01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:24.240
<v Josh Sparkes>Us to pay the control and give a
notification of this loser passing</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39618-1
01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:31.643
<v Josh Sparkes>registered as date approved and we also
put it to the end and we would do exactly</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39618-2
01:57:31.643 --> 01:57:33.900
<v Josh Sparkes>the same for a rejection.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39642-0
01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:41.522
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you approve that? Yes, we can have.
We can add it and we can have different</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39642-1
01:57:41.522 --> 01:57:46.075
<v Josh Sparkes>forms,
but the report we asked for the last one,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39642-2
01:57:46.075 --> 01:57:49.420
<v Josh Sparkes>so I don't know where it's rejected.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39646-0
01:57:49.620 --> 01:58:02.020
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it's beautiful. Yeah, it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39663-0
01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:24.620
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39676-0
01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:37.143
<v Josh Sparkes>It looks out of the other side and then
message. Yeah, yeah. I just have a little.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39676-1
01:58:37.143 --> 01:58:40.260
<v Josh Sparkes>I just have a little.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39693-0
01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:47.829
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, you're tracking that one.
It's nice to see if somebody's come back</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39693-1
01:58:47.829 --> 01:58:54.189
<v Josh Sparkes>on a SQL TV, you know,
because somebody will see that pop up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39693-2
01:58:54.189 --> 01:58:55.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Most of the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39697-0
01:58:55.860 --> 01:59:03.338
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, exactly, but it was like,
but it was, you know, like the same,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39697-1
01:59:03.338 --> 01:59:11.020
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, like the same morning. Oh,
we need to subscribe and then that's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39703-0
01:59:11.740 --> 01:59:30.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it just?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39718-0
01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:38.128
<v Josh Sparkes>Well, that's so like, it's like,
it's like, it's like, it's like,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39718-1
01:59:38.128 --> 01:59:46.611
<v Josh Sparkes>it's like they will be one or two of you.
So it's a very good question and that's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39718-2
01:59:46.611 --> 01:59:49.300
<v Josh Sparkes>really probably the point.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39738-0
01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:55.301
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like in the rotate. I didn't take.
Yeah, it's just otherwise in both classes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39738-1
01:59:55.301 --> 02:00:00.366
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's when you buy this,
then we'll be able to then we'll take the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39738-2
02:00:00.366 --> 02:00:03.862
<v Josh Sparkes>slides.
So then we manage is then the next thing</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39738-3
02:00:03.862 --> 02:00:07.500
<v Josh Sparkes>that he's want to take.
It's possible to see. Yes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39738-4
02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:09.140
<v Josh Sparkes>the emails was scammed.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39741-0
02:00:09.660 --> 02:00:24.260
<v Josh Sparkes>It's on everything. It's the first one.
It's not. It's not.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39748-0
02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:31.980
<v Josh Sparkes>I want to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39767-0
02:00:44.260 --> 02:01:02.780
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm confident that it's never a challenge.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39798-0
02:01:22.980 --> 02:01:41.500
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So it's not. Sorry. Yeah.
So it's possible in morning.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39829-0
02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:59.378
<v Josh Sparkes>I think this is a separate equation.
So I tell them we'll take the three</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39829-1
02:01:59.378 --> 02:02:03.140
<v Josh Sparkes>things that goes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39836-0
02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:13.883
<v Josh Sparkes>So I just got an e-mail.
I'm just looking at it like that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39836-1
02:02:13.883 --> 02:02:23.100
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's why we didn't upgrad.
I think it's fine.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39844-0
02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:43.140
<v Josh Sparkes>You can get that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39865-0
02:02:43.420 --> 02:02:52.279
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we need,
I think it's Friday, July.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39865-1
02:02:52.279 --> 02:03:01.900
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's not explained to you,
but it's not. I mean, it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39879-0
02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:16.340
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you read that?
It's a little bit blurred on mine as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39880-0
02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:20.340
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39882-0
02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:22.260
<v Josh Sparkes>It's quick.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39912-0
02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:31.542
<v Josh Sparkes>To submit. So I think we have. Yeah,
Tim thinks it's covered as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39912-1
02:03:31.542 --> 02:03:36.664
<v Josh Sparkes>It looks like we've covered it.
And then on the rejection part is the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39912-2
02:03:36.664 --> 02:03:41.420
<v Josh Sparkes>same, but these there's some reasons here,
which is good for us.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39917-0
02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:45.900
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I see non compliant with.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39950-0
02:03:57.700 --> 02:04:02.992
<v Josh Sparkes>But these are just these are. Yeah,
these are just reasons. Yeah, exactly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39950-1
02:04:02.992 --> 02:04:08.918
<v Josh Sparkes>And there's some logic here. The reasons.
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen this the other day.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39950-2
02:04:08.918 --> 02:04:10.540
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, right. Yeah, I had.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39975-0
02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:16.205
<v Josh Sparkes>Remembered that when I've gone,
I was thinking, sure,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39975-1
02:04:16.205 --> 02:04:20.781
<v Josh Sparkes>that's part of the managing voice,
but I want to do all the managing and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39975-2
02:04:20.781 --> 02:04:24.292
<v Josh Sparkes>then part that that's it was covered.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39975-3
02:04:24.292 --> 02:04:27.300
<v Josh Sparkes>So it'll be a quick one to cover,
but I've got.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39989-0
02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:34.650
<v Josh Sparkes>Bearing. Bearing. Billing query.
Billing query on this list.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39989-1
02:04:34.650 --> 02:04:36.380
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it not on this list?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39995-0
02:04:37.900 --> 02:04:41.820
<v Josh Sparkes>Link query the 39 on that and.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/39996-0
02:04:43.340 --> 02:04:43.460
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40033-0
02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:51.016
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean it. I can't. Why? If it count,
it should be. It should be 39 processes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40033-1
02:04:51.016 --> 02:04:54.868
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I don't know where there's where there's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40033-2
02:04:54.868 --> 02:04:59.540
<v Josh Sparkes>one extra. Maybe one has fully duplicated.
I'm not sure.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40053-0
02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:06.082
<v Josh Sparkes>But but there's no building query there.
So where was that ever on the master</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40053-1
02:05:06.082 --> 02:05:09.731
<v Josh Sparkes>process list?
I think we can maybe it was checked,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40053-2
02:05:09.731 --> 02:05:12.020
<v Josh Sparkes>but there was part of the query.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40066-0
02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:21.478
<v Josh Sparkes>So maybe just on the master evening,
if you can. Uh, Oh yeah, sorry. Yeah, um,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40056-0
02:05:14.380 --> 02:05:15.100
<v Mark Sedgey>Would.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40066-1
02:05:21.478 --> 02:05:23.140
<v Josh Sparkes>really quick look.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40070-0
02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:26.980
<v Josh Sparkes>Let me go, let me scroll to the left.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40098-0
02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:33.168
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, a SEC. Oh, yeah, that. Yeah,
the guys on the phone will do.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40098-1
02:05:33.168 --> 02:05:39.900
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll just let them know that we can do it
now. Just returning now in a second, guys.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40099-0
02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:42.500
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, no worries. Thanks.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40141-0
02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:48.390
<v Josh Sparkes>Usage fee, invoice rejection,
admin rights, admin rights. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40141-1
02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:52.483
<v Josh Sparkes>So I don't know where I got that from. Oh,
I can see.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40141-2
02:05:52.483 --> 02:05:58.242
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that just because of the maybe the
e-billing query? Maybe that's for me.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40141-3
02:05:58.242 --> 02:06:02.940
<v Josh Sparkes>It's queries of admin.
It does ring a bell. Yeah, it must be.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40145-0
02:06:03.140 --> 02:06:06.200
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, well,
it doesn't matter because we're going to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40145-1
02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:07.820
<v Josh Sparkes>talk about it anyway, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40184-0
02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:18.411
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
the the category two in the on the no the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40184-1
02:06:18.411 --> 02:06:24.156
<v Josh Sparkes>other way. Sorry, going, yeah,
but I did a control F and it didn't find</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40184-2
02:06:24.156 --> 02:06:30.460
<v Josh Sparkes>it anyway, so it's not behind some built.
I mean, it's not in this whole list.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40212-0
02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:35.430
<v Josh Sparkes>But it might be behind a filter.
But how do I get the filters off? No,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40212-1
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:40.276
<v Josh Sparkes>I just took everything was just you
billing on your sheet. Yeah. Oh yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40212-2
02:06:40.276 --> 02:06:44.860
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, yeah. Don't say billing. OK, well,
we'll talk around it anyway.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40218-0
02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:52.300
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, we'll get back into it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40243-0
02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:13.531
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the process 165. Yeah,
we're just gonna cover it off as part of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40243-1
02:07:13.531 --> 02:07:16.700
<v Josh Sparkes>that, right? That's the one we're to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40245-0
02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:22.660
<v Josh Sparkes>I.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40282-0
02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:35.543
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Yeah,
as part of your landscape of the as is,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40282-1
02:07:35.543 --> 02:07:43.099
<v Josh Sparkes>there was one or two processes here and
you know I think 16511 that needed some</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40282-2
02:07:43.099 --> 02:07:45.460
<v Josh Sparkes>additional clarification.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40326-0
02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:50.655
<v Josh Sparkes>But actually I did it in this audio where
we went through managing voice,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40326-1
02:07:50.655 --> 02:07:54.841
<v Josh Sparkes>upload invoice for a reason that I
thought it actually having looked at it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40326-2
02:07:54.841 --> 02:07:59.246
<v Josh Sparkes>it would probably fall out that we've
covered it and you can see if I made this</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40326-3
02:07:59.246 --> 02:08:02.660
<v Josh Sparkes>upload via auto submit.
So I don't think having a look at it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40350-0
02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:09.422
<v Josh Sparkes>Unless you disagree that there's nothing
additional to cover in this process and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40350-1
02:08:09.422 --> 02:08:16.268
<v Josh Sparkes>actually it is handled by the high level
managing voice service. I'd recommend it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40350-2
02:08:16.268 --> 02:08:18.660
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the same same plug, yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40392-0
02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:24.131
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.
And the reasons for rejection very fast,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40392-1
02:08:24.131 --> 02:08:28.867
<v Josh Sparkes>Mark,
and I can see you can see it on here that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40392-2
02:08:28.867 --> 02:08:35.380
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got different reasons and we can
capture them on here, so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40433-0
02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:38.998
<v Josh Sparkes>I think based on what we've discussed and
what we've captured,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40433-1
02:08:38.998 --> 02:08:41.837
<v Josh Sparkes>there's such a process that probably
needs workshopping.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40433-2
02:08:41.837 --> 02:08:45.821
<v Josh Sparkes>I think in that way because we sort of
workshopped it and inferred that this is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40433-3
02:08:45.821 --> 02:08:48.809
<v Josh Sparkes>how we would land.
So hopefully you're in a green week that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40433-4
02:08:48.809 --> 02:08:50.900
<v Josh Sparkes>that's been covered. Yeah, we also submit.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40448-0
02:08:52.660 --> 02:09:05.180
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, perfect. Perfect outcome. Yeah,
single process. I know the number.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40451-0
02:09:06.100 --> 02:09:08.900
<v Josh Sparkes>It won't always be that that simple Babs.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40480-0
02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:14.021
<v Josh Sparkes>And then I suppose,
although it's not on the year in the back</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40480-1
02:09:14.021 --> 02:09:17.312
<v Josh Sparkes>of my mind,
happened in the past and I think that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40480-2
02:09:17.312 --> 02:09:21.722
<v Josh Sparkes>might follow across billing admin,
there was some other happening.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40480-3
02:09:21.722 --> 02:09:24.420
<v Josh Sparkes>So based on that, there's probably query.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40485-0
02:09:26.380 --> 02:09:28.020
<v Josh Sparkes>Masaratman.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40490-0
02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:32.140
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, so Brian Adman.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40526-0
02:09:35.780 --> 02:09:42.042
<v Josh Sparkes>And some of that comes from some of the
processes that we're picking up with</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40526-1
02:09:42.042 --> 02:09:46.108
<v Josh Sparkes>correction detection.
So you've got client admin,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40526-2
02:09:46.108 --> 02:09:52.370
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice admin and matter admin as a
subsections of these services that we've</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40526-3
02:09:52.370 --> 02:09:53.020
<v Josh Sparkes>already.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40529-0
02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:56.460
<v Josh Sparkes>Discards, would you say,
although in addition to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40569-0
02:09:58.340 --> 02:10:03.051
<v Josh Sparkes>In addition to in the way in which they,
so how they're triggered,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40569-1
02:10:03.051 --> 02:10:08.114
<v Josh Sparkes>I suppose that's probably a good place to
start is how they get raised,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40569-2
02:10:08.114 --> 02:10:13.880
<v Josh Sparkes>why they get raised and who raises them.
So we can we can raise something there's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40569-3
02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:14.020
<v Josh Sparkes>a.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40594-0
02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:20.272
<v Josh Sparkes>Admin service.
That's part of even that we can recommend.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40594-1
02:10:20.272 --> 02:10:26.940
<v Josh Sparkes>Admin service kind of the the general
query around the topic. Yeah, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40603-0
02:10:29.140 --> 02:10:34.190
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's not in this this list
originally, is it? It's not.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40603-1
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:35.900
<v Josh Sparkes>It hasn't got an MPL.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40621-0
02:10:36.980 --> 02:10:42.451
<v Josh Sparkes>And you have like a invoice query,
a timekeeper query.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40621-1
02:10:42.451 --> 02:10:48.120
<v Josh Sparkes>You have it say it like that.
It's just clear with this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40648-0
02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:56.625
<v Josh Sparkes>Right. OK. Have you got the map?
Can you show it? No, it is.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40648-1
02:10:56.625 --> 02:11:02.011
<v Josh Sparkes>Was it in the I manage? Is that I manage,
right? Tim,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40648-2
02:11:02.011 --> 02:11:06.100
<v Josh Sparkes>was that one of the ones that was loaded?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40652-0
02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:10.100
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, and it will be fine.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40656-0
02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:15.740
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll be something. Yeah, you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40685-0
02:11:18.660 --> 02:11:22.562
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Oh,
so I have to find the sort of trigger</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40685-1
02:11:22.562 --> 02:11:26.974
<v Josh Sparkes>points for those.
So you're coming from the portal,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40685-2
02:11:26.974 --> 02:11:33.420
<v Josh Sparkes>I guess in terms of admin where we have
to submit budget and anticipate it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40686-0
02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:34.540
<v Josh Sparkes>Really.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40705-0
02:11:44.540 --> 02:11:50.940
<v Josh Sparkes>Can everyone hear on the call? Sorry,
should we should we get a mic?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40712-0
02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:53.043
<v Mark Sedgey>We we can. I can hear you and Josh.
There's some other,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40732-0
02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:57.643
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Yeah, the mic,
just so that you can pick it up or maybe</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40712-1
02:11:53.043 --> 02:11:55.500
<v Mark Sedgey>some of the other team slightly low.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40732-1
02:11:57.643 --> 02:12:01.582
<v Josh Sparkes>the one that one's probably done this for
group.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40732-2
02:12:01.582 --> 02:12:06.807
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll see if you can just hold that.
We'll turn that meeting up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40732-3
02:12:06.807 --> 02:12:09.540
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it working OK? Yeah, let's see.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40768-0
02:12:11.140 --> 02:12:15.643
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, and I can see answer in general,
is that? Yeah, that would be him.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40768-1
02:12:15.643 --> 02:12:20.590
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's a race in the world one,
but actually looks like it was created on</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40768-2
02:12:20.590 --> 02:12:23.888
<v Josh Sparkes>the 11th of June 2025.
It was like PE have done it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40768-3
02:12:23.888 --> 02:12:25.980
<v Josh Sparkes>so it looks like Inaki's done it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40794-0
02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:31.174
<v Josh Sparkes>For the rest of the world.
And then there's another one for Oz,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40794-1
02:12:31.174 --> 02:12:36.990
<v Josh Sparkes>which is, let me tell you, the same date.
I don't know if it's been amended.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40794-2
02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:40.540
<v Josh Sparkes>Have you been working with PE on anything?
No.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40838-0
02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:46.604
<v Josh Sparkes>Change. Let me just check the first tab.
What was it called, Mel? Sorry,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40838-1
02:12:46.604 --> 02:12:51.911
<v Josh Sparkes>it's called answering general queries.
There's one for Oz and then there's one</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40838-2
02:12:51.911 --> 02:12:56.142
<v Josh Sparkes>for rest of the world.
I don't know if there's just maybe been</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40838-3
02:12:56.142 --> 02:13:01.180
<v Josh Sparkes>an update to it because on like the first
page it says it's got your name.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40849-0
02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:06.261
<v Josh Sparkes>Minutes the 17th of February 2023.
That sound more right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40849-1
02:13:06.261 --> 02:13:09.340
<v Josh Sparkes>Says approved verbally in workshops.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40851-0
02:13:13.020 --> 02:13:13.140
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40853-0
02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:18.180
<v Josh Sparkes>So coming to it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40900-0
02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:29.747
<v Josh Sparkes>I suppose it's just a general query when
it's maybe just good to understand what</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40900-1
02:13:29.747 --> 02:13:34.770
<v Josh Sparkes>kind of general queries you get through
and we can maybe work from there. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40900-2
02:13:34.770 --> 02:13:39.166
<v Josh Sparkes>exactly. So what's the triggers?
Where do they start? How to do that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40900-3
02:13:39.166 --> 02:13:41.740
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a lot on this map that says that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40942-0
02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:46.777
<v Josh Sparkes>It's got like invoice status updates,
requests for e-billing matter IDs,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40942-1
02:13:46.777 --> 02:13:50.280
<v Josh Sparkes>requesting client e-billing requirements,
W8 forms,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40942-2
02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:54.254
<v Josh Sparkes>submitting matter budgets to portal
client requesting PDF,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40942-3
02:13:54.254 --> 02:13:59.575
<v Josh Sparkes>asking a client is e-billing and then
client request bank details information.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40942-4
02:13:59.575 --> 02:14:01.460
<v Josh Sparkes>Does that sound right? Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40943-0
02:14:02.580 --> 02:14:03.100
<v Josh Sparkes>Hmm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40944-0
02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:06.340
<v Josh Sparkes>Mhm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40972-0
02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:12.844
<v Josh Sparkes>So some of them that that's pre-activity
of client on board.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40972-1
02:14:12.844 --> 02:14:16.759
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there some pre-activity or they all
post activity?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40972-2
02:14:16.759 --> 02:14:20.965
<v Josh Sparkes>I suppose some of them are like,
is this client on board?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/40972-3
02:14:20.965 --> 02:14:23.140
<v Josh Sparkes>Is this client people in that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41020-0
02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:27.048
<v Josh Sparkes>Brilliant.
So part of the pre then if we can get</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41020-1
02:14:27.048 --> 02:14:30.870
<v Josh Sparkes>another job,
these are all our clients that we've got</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41020-2
02:14:30.870 --> 02:14:35.823
<v Josh Sparkes>on boarded because we've got a
requirement spreadsheet that has every</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41020-3
02:14:35.823 --> 02:14:40.423
<v Josh Sparkes>client we've on boarded,
what they need for their interest to be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41020-4
02:14:40.423 --> 02:14:41.060
<v Josh Sparkes>accepted.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41055-0
02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:45.042
<v Josh Sparkes>Biggest reference to that rather than
sending us.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41055-1
02:14:45.042 --> 02:14:51.172
<v Josh Sparkes>I think when we talked about queries
through the people workshops last week,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41055-2
02:14:51.172 --> 02:14:57.940
<v Josh Sparkes>we were just agreeing that there would be
one query request portal form for example.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41052-0
02:14:58.540 --> 02:14:58.780
<v Mark Sedgey>Yep.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41067-0
02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:03.185
<v Josh Sparkes>And and that would come in. Mark,
can you keep me right around what we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41067-1
02:15:03.185 --> 02:15:04.140
<v Josh Sparkes>agreed on that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41108-0
02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:07.288
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah,
I was just going to jump in and say the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41108-1
02:15:07.288 --> 02:15:10.326
<v Mark Sedgey>same thing.
You'd have a single one with various with</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41108-2
02:15:10.326 --> 02:15:14.377
<v Mark Sedgey>pick lists, but where possible,
if there are knowledge collateral which</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41108-3
02:15:14.377 --> 02:15:17.021
<v Mark Sedgey>would save them needing to obviously
raise it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41108-4
02:15:17.021 --> 02:15:20.340
<v Mark Sedgey>you'd you'd obviously try to route them
to that knowledge.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41156-0
02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:27.994
<v Josh Sparkes>And then if it's helpful,
they see that if it's then they can raise</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41156-1
02:15:27.994 --> 02:15:32.906
<v Josh Sparkes>presumably a further query mark.
Is that what you're saying on the back of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41156-2
02:15:32.906 --> 02:15:35.985
<v Josh Sparkes>that?
It's a it roots into a knowledge article</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41134-0
02:15:33.620 --> 02:15:35.020
<v Mark Sedgey>Sorry, say that again.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41156-3
02:15:35.985 --> 02:15:40.700
<v Josh Sparkes>based on their query and if it's still
unanswered, they can then raise.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41222-0
02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:45.773
<v Mark Sedgey>Yes. So, So what we would,
what we would want to achieve is that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41222-1
02:15:45.773 --> 02:15:50.490
<v Mark Sedgey>they either search that if they don't
actively search for the knowledge and see</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41222-2
02:15:50.490 --> 02:15:54.853
<v Mark Sedgey>it as they're raising the query,
we would want to be presenting knowledge</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41185-0
02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:53.100
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41222-3
02:15:54.853 --> 02:15:59.452
<v Mark Sedgey>collateral associated with it so that
they could click on that without having</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41222-4
02:15:59.452 --> 02:16:01.220
<v Mark Sedgey>to even submit it potentially.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41270-0
02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:04.615
<v Mark Sedgey>And then if they still want to submit it,
you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41270-1
02:16:04.615 --> 02:16:08.539
<v Mark Sedgey>they they can obviously put that through
to the team to then support.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41270-2
02:16:08.539 --> 02:16:11.791
<v Mark Sedgey>But what you do want them to do is to
give you, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41270-3
02:16:11.791 --> 02:16:15.995
<v Mark Sedgey>to maybe help them with some sort of
categorisation to their query because</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41270-4
02:16:15.995 --> 02:16:17.340
<v Mark Sedgey>then again depending on.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41280-0
02:16:18.100 --> 02:16:20.264
<v Mark Sedgey>You know the skill set or what they're
asking.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41280-1
02:16:20.264 --> 02:16:22.980
<v Mark Sedgey>You might route it to different personnel
within the team.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41293-0
02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:26.676
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
is is Mark is that through ITSM Pro we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41293-1
02:16:26.676 --> 02:16:29.460
<v Josh Sparkes>can do that intelligent searching in KBS.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41303-0
02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:34.260
<v Mark Sedgey>Um, I'm not sure. I I'd have to um.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41326-0
02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:35.606
<v Parik Narain>Searching, searching is going to be there.
Josh doesn't matter.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41326-1
02:16:35.606 --> 02:16:39.798
<v Parik Narain>I think we have we have the right
licensing for searching every AI search</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41316-0
02:16:38.260 --> 02:16:38.580
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

<v Parik Narain>is enabled throughout the platform.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41325-0
02:16:40.620 --> 02:16:40.820
<v Josh Sparkes>It.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41328-0
02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:43.500
<v Josh Sparkes>Great.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41352-0

02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:56.843
<v Josh Sparkes>And just the knowledge articles is a
really good point.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41353-0
02:16:54.220 --> 02:16:54.500
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41406-1
02:16:56.843 --> 02:16:59.293
<v Josh Sparkes>We were just talking about that in the
break.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41406-2
02:16:59.293 --> 02:17:02.222
<v Josh Sparkes>We probably haven't discussed anything
for these guys,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41406-3
02:17:02.222 --> 02:17:05.577
<v Josh Sparkes>knowledge articles wise and how we want
to capture that stuff.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41406-4
02:17:05.577 --> 02:17:08.985
<v Josh Sparkes>Would you guys get any thoughts on how
you want to do that? Oh,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41406-5
02:17:08.985 --> 02:17:12.340
<v Josh Sparkes>there is a template we want to want to
share. Yeah, capturing.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41449-0
02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:15.997
<v Josh Sparkes>Because you'll have some documents
already, Lauren, won't you?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41449-1
02:17:15.997 --> 02:17:20.168
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll just maybe do a collation of
that and see how we can interpret it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41449-2
02:17:20.168 --> 02:17:24.667
<v Josh Sparkes>It would be good just to deal with it the
same ways we're dealing with it for all</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41449-3
02:17:24.667 --> 02:17:28.893
<v Josh Sparkes>of us. So we take a look at those.
Do you want to upload these to the teams?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41449-4
02:17:28.893 --> 02:17:31.307
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes,
I'll put them in there and then we can</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41449-5
02:17:31.307 --> 02:17:32.020
<v Josh Sparkes>analyse them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41455-0
02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:36.060
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a part of the knowledge, yeah,
and that one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41473-0
02:17:36.980 --> 02:17:40.029
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.
I'll also add that to this list. Yes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41520-0
02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:43.969
<v Mark Sedgey>Josh, that need, sorry Josh,
just quickly we this is where we as a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41473-1
02:17:40.029 --> 02:17:40.340
<v Josh Sparkes>Mark.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41520-1
02:17:43.969 --> 02:17:46.998
<v Mark Sedgey>collective need to sort of join up with
the,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41520-2
02:17:46.998 --> 02:17:52.045
<v Mark Sedgey>you know the sort of enterprise view of
knowledge. So what Hannah's doing,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41520-3
02:17:52.045 --> 02:17:57.294
<v Mark Sedgey>you know what the IT team are doing,
anything that you need that you're doing</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41520-4
02:17:57.294 --> 02:17:59.380
<v Mark Sedgey>that maybe is client facing as.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41537-0
02:17:59.460 --> 02:18:02.925
<v Mark Sedgey>As to internally facing,
making sure we brand it all consistently</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41537-1
02:18:02.925 --> 02:18:05.918
<v Mark Sedgey>and things like that.
So we just need to make sure we're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41537-2
02:18:05.918 --> 02:18:07.860
<v Mark Sedgey>rounding up with Hannah and the crew.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41551-0
02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:12.485
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, sure. Yeah,
we can collect textual content for them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41542-0
02:18:09.420 --> 02:18:09.780
<v Mark Sedgey>Cool.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41551-1
02:18:12.485 --> 02:18:15.700
<v Josh Sparkes>They align on that that side of things.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41572-0
02:18:19.140 --> 02:18:26.313
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, queries. Yep, around the query point.
I'll take notes to add to this this,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41572-1
02:18:26.313 --> 02:18:30.580
<v Josh Sparkes>but it will be building on that general
query.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41605-0
02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:42.804
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. I think, yeah, processes, high volume,
discussion points, triggers, etcetera.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41605-1
02:18:42.804 --> 02:18:46.040
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got a lot captured today.
So thank you. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41605-2
02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:50.957
<v Josh Sparkes>I think there's just a couple of quick
things we wanted to to go through after</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41605-3
02:18:50.957 --> 02:18:53.820
<v Josh Sparkes>that. But yeah, that is the bulk,
absolutely.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41646-0
02:18:55.180 --> 02:18:58.361
<v Josh Sparkes>1st is prioritisation.
So as I said at the start,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41646-1
02:18:58.361 --> 02:19:03.259
<v Josh Sparkes>we can only fit X amount of highly
automated mature processes or services in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41646-2
02:19:03.259 --> 02:19:06.757
<v Josh Sparkes>in the time period.
So I just wanted to kind of gather</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41646-3
02:19:06.757 --> 02:19:12.100
<v Josh Sparkes>thoughts on what we thought would be the
most impactful if we could fully automate.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41682-0
02:19:13.260 --> 02:19:17.588
<v Josh Sparkes>We've already gathered,
we've already gathered the volumes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41682-1
02:19:17.588 --> 02:19:21.338
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got volumetrics here.
Let's move to this one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41682-2
02:19:21.338 --> 02:19:25.233
<v Josh Sparkes>So obviously super heavy on the manage
invoice. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41682-3
02:19:25.233 --> 02:19:27.540
<v Josh Sparkes>that not sure that's completely.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41694-0
02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:30.926
<v Josh Sparkes>Completely right,
but a good point is in the right</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41694-1
02:19:30.926 --> 02:19:35.020
<v Josh Sparkes>direction. Well, that will be the sorry,
what are you talking about?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41703-0
02:19:36.420 --> 02:19:41.660
<v Josh Sparkes>How much is that yearly or monthly? Uh,
I believe that's monthly from the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41715-0
02:19:42.860 --> 02:19:46.608
<v Josh Sparkes>From the from the spreadsheet I saw,
could that be correcting I've I've</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41715-1
02:19:46.608 --> 02:19:47.180
<v Josh Sparkes>aggregated.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41717-0
02:19:49.500 --> 02:19:49.780
<v Josh Sparkes>Monthly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41734-0
02:19:50.660 --> 02:19:53.380
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, yeah, I just aggregated a bunch.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41744-0
02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:56.888
<v Mark Sedgey>Josh, I thought it was over. Josh,
if it's the one that we both saw,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41744-1
02:19:56.888 --> 02:19:58.700
<v Mark Sedgey>I think it was over 8 weeks.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41753-0
02:20:00.700 --> 02:20:03.020
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, was it? OK, very good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41777-0
02:20:01.700 --> 02:20:06.434
<v Mark Sedgey>I think it was an 8 week reporting cycle.
Again, check me if I'm wrong on that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41777-1
02:20:06.434 --> 02:20:10.220
<v Mark Sedgey>but it I mean equally it's the target
volume, so regardless of.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41815-0
02:20:10.500 --> 02:20:13.560
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, the the,
the actual number is less important.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41815-1
02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:18.268
<v Josh Sparkes>It's more the the idea of that's a very,
very whole heavy volume service that's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41815-2
02:20:18.268 --> 02:20:22.857
<v Josh Sparkes>used and then that manage invoice piece.
So a lot of that will be your portal</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41815-3
02:20:22.857 --> 02:20:25.740
<v Josh Sparkes>notifications that's driving that up or
is that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41849-0
02:20:27.220 --> 02:20:31.847
<v Josh Sparkes>Does that look great from an invoice
number? In terms of invoices,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41849-1
02:20:31.847 --> 02:20:37.165
<v Josh Sparkes>we upload about 800 to 1200 per month
currently depending on the time of the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41849-2
02:20:37.165 --> 02:20:40.411
<v Josh Sparkes>year.
There were a lot around rejects invoice,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41849-3
02:20:40.411 --> 02:20:42.620
<v Josh Sparkes>so I think it's each of your 22.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41887-0
02:20:44.740 --> 02:20:49.433
<v Josh Sparkes>Processes, there were lots of numbers.
So you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41887-1
02:20:49.433 --> 02:20:53.856
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it actually came in maybe two
mailboxes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41887-2
02:20:53.856 --> 02:20:59.632
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it was lots of and then rest of
the world we had three.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41887-3
02:20:59.632 --> 02:21:02.700
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it was the highest volume.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41923-0
02:21:03.140 --> 02:21:06.860
<v Josh Sparkes>Of activities across the financial web
streams per month.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41923-1
02:21:06.860 --> 02:21:11.605
<v Josh Sparkes>So that highlights that even further than
it is the high volume activity.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41923-2
02:21:11.605 --> 02:21:15.260
<v Josh Sparkes>There's probably some dividing down on
that one perhaps,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41923-3
02:21:15.260 --> 02:21:19.300
<v Josh Sparkes>but but the the point remains,
it's a very, very heavy volume.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41964-0
02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:23.554
<v Josh Sparkes>And the others less so.
So five client onboardings per month,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41964-1
02:21:23.554 --> 02:21:27.869
<v Josh Sparkes>could that be correct or something like
that? OK, so that's volume.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41964-2
02:21:27.869 --> 02:21:32.247
<v Josh Sparkes>And then on the value front,
we've kind of estimated what we what we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/41964-3
02:21:32.247 --> 02:21:36.180
<v Josh Sparkes>think if we could automate this,
how impactful would that be?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42013-0
02:21:36.900 --> 02:21:40.340
<v Josh Sparkes>For you guys. So things like query,
like it's kind of hard to automate</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42013-1
02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:43.730
<v Josh Sparkes>because you have to actually look through
it and answer it, etcetera.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42013-2
02:21:43.730 --> 02:21:47.412
<v Josh Sparkes>But things like managing invoice,
if we could, then it'd be very impactful.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42013-3
02:21:47.412 --> 02:21:51.142
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you just look at where they've
landed and we basically have to do this</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42013-4
02:21:51.142 --> 02:21:53.660
<v Josh Sparkes>across us,
so we'll end up with a list of the most.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42034-0
02:21:54.580 --> 02:21:58.566
<v Josh Sparkes>Impactful things that we can focus on and
prioritize.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42034-1
02:21:58.566 --> 02:22:02.846
<v Josh Sparkes>So the top managed invoice with a very
high number there,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42034-2
02:22:02.846 --> 02:22:05.060
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just multiplied together.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42072-0
02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:09.521
<v Josh Sparkes>Does this order kind of make sense to you
manage invoice?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42072-1
02:22:09.521 --> 02:22:13.532
<v Josh Sparkes>Most impactful if we could automate
client accruals down to billing query at</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42072-2
02:22:13.532 --> 02:22:16.241
<v Josh Sparkes>the bottom.
This one is marked in red because we're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42072-3
02:22:16.241 --> 02:22:18.897
<v Josh Sparkes>going to we've got a parking lot item on
that one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42072-4
02:22:18.897 --> 02:22:23.220
<v Josh Sparkes>But would you want to switch any of these
round? Are we off here with our numbers?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42074-0
02:22:23.220 --> 02:22:24.340
<v Josh Sparkes>At ordering.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42082-0
02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:34.460
<v Josh Sparkes>Seems to roughly make sense.
Just a rough idea.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42101-0
02:22:35.620 --> 02:22:40.232
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what the timing is already doing a
lot of automation as much as we can</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42101-1
02:22:40.232 --> 02:22:43.660
<v Josh Sparkes>without finding the rates,
without thought. Oh, OK, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42104-0
02:22:52.460 --> 02:22:52.860
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42148-0
02:22:54.340 --> 02:22:58.890
<v Josh Sparkes>All right. And so it's just a quick,
quick exercise and then when we get to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42148-1
02:22:58.890 --> 02:23:03.320
<v Josh Sparkes>the end of all the work streams,
we'll have a view on what's the priority</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42148-2
02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:08.408
<v Josh Sparkes>for auto automation and and impacts there.
But that's all. This is a very quick one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42148-3
02:23:08.408 --> 02:23:11.940
<v Josh Sparkes>We wanted to run a few ideas of what we
thought impactful.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42188-0
02:23:12.300 --> 02:23:16.070
<v Josh Sparkes>Reports could be.
We just saw some some good dashboards</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42188-1
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:20.849
<v Josh Sparkes>there that was that were useful,
but these are perhaps some some ideas</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42188-2
02:23:20.849 --> 02:23:25.560
<v Josh Sparkes>around what we could run for for reports.
Please have a look through.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42188-3
02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:29.060
<v Josh Sparkes>So you might expect ticket volume and
aging report.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42191-0
02:23:29.660 --> 02:23:30.380
<v Josh Sparkes>By type.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42193-0
02:23:32.980 --> 02:23:33.340
<v Josh Sparkes>Because.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42229-0
02:23:42.100 --> 02:23:49.577
<v Josh Sparkes>The higher value ones and all that
dialogue today, we've got, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42229-1
02:23:49.577 --> 02:23:58.300
<v Josh Sparkes>a few dashboard activities that will help
drive that activity which we've captured.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42235-0
02:23:58.700 --> 02:24:00.980
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm seeing.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42274-0
02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:03.343
<v Mark Sedgey>There's a couple of no,
I was just going to say one of the things</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42274-1
02:24:03.343 --> 02:24:08.374
<v Mark Sedgey>we need to think about on this one was
not only dashboards for the operational</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42274-2
02:24:08.374 --> 02:24:13.342
<v Mark Sedgey>teams, yeah, the teams doing the work,
but also some of those dashboards that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42274-3
02:24:13.342 --> 02:24:16.780
<v Mark Sedgey>will help the leadership manage some of
the upstream.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42306-0
02:24:17.180 --> 02:24:22.142
<v Mark Sedgey>Shifts in terms of behaviour or focus
perhaps and things like that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42306-1
02:24:22.142 --> 02:24:27.323
<v Mark Sedgey>So there's there's it might be worth
splitting this out to operational</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42306-2
02:24:27.323 --> 02:24:31.700
<v Mark Sedgey>dashboards and dashboards and MI for
leadership type stuff.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42305-0
02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:33.860
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42345-0
02:24:34.900 --> 02:24:39.354
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, just on that part, Mark,
I would agree with you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42345-1
02:24:39.354 --> 02:24:45.508
<v Josh Sparkes>If we look at it from a different angle,
even from those that send requests</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42345-2
02:24:45.508 --> 02:24:50.124
<v Josh Sparkes>through to us,
the biggest probably query will be what's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42345-3
02:24:50.124 --> 02:24:51.500
<v Josh Sparkes>the status of my.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42376-0
02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:59.467
<v Josh Sparkes>Bill. So anything that helps a PE look at,
I've got five partners,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42376-1
02:24:59.467 --> 02:25:04.340
<v Josh Sparkes>what are the state of all the bills that
are sitting?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42371-0
02:25:04.420 --> 02:25:04.700
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42408-0
02:25:05.380 --> 02:25:09.742
<v Josh Sparkes>Potentially in the team and we could go
wider than just the e-billing team, right,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42408-1
02:25:09.742 --> 02:25:12.106
<v Josh Sparkes>because it could be with rates for
instance.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42408-2
02:25:12.106 --> 02:25:16.415
<v Josh Sparkes>So I would just something for us to think
about when we go into some of the other</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42395-0
02:25:13.900 --> 02:25:14.140
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42466-0
02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:19.448
<v Mark Sedgey>Well, exactly.
And that's kind of where I was thinking</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42408-3
02:25:16.415 --> 02:25:16.940
<v Josh Sparkes>workshops.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42466-1
02:25:19.448 --> 02:25:23.794
<v Mark Sedgey>because we'd built it out right over a
number of the, you know, the heavy,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42466-2
02:25:23.794 --> 02:25:26.460
<v Mark Sedgey>as I say,
sort of the heavy disciplines where</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42466-3
02:25:26.460 --> 02:25:30.401
<v Mark Sedgey>you're getting, you know, a lot of,
you know, a lot of quick. Well,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42466-4
02:25:30.401 --> 02:25:34.110
<v Mark Sedgey>let's put it this way,
a lot of the disciplines we're providing</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42466-5
02:25:34.110 --> 02:25:35.500
<v Mark Sedgey>proactive management MI.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42515-0
02:25:36.220 --> 02:25:40.856
<v Mark Sedgey>Could ease some of your response demand
would be a solid way of working forward</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42515-1
02:25:40.856 --> 02:25:45.665
<v Mark Sedgey>because you can not only give them Intel,
but you can also highlight you know your</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42515-2
02:25:45.665 --> 02:25:48.330
<v Mark Sedgey>areas raising this much or whatever you
know.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42515-3
02:25:48.330 --> 02:25:53.023
<v Mark Sedgey>So some of those things you know you're
sending X amount of emails this month as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42515-4
02:25:53.023 --> 02:25:53.660
<v Mark Sedgey>opposed to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42535-0
02:25:54.100 --> 02:25:58.660
<v Mark Sedgey>Y month or whatever, you know,
certain things that could help help steer</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42535-1
02:25:58.660 --> 02:26:02.220
<v Mark Sedgey>the behaviors that we want in a proactive,
positive way.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42548-0
02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:09.580
<v Josh Sparkes>So I guess the question to you is what
would help the PES?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42569-0
02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:14.963
<v Josh Sparkes>Or the partners who raise queries with us?
What?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42569-1
02:26:14.963 --> 02:26:21.980
<v Josh Sparkes>What visibility could we give them that
would help you and your team do their job?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42598-0
02:26:28.740 --> 02:26:32.732
<v Josh Sparkes>So it goes like, you know,
this isn't for Justice Labour.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42598-1
02:26:32.732 --> 02:26:37.757
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got answering the questions that
you get most asked. Where is it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42598-2
02:26:37.757 --> 02:26:41.060
<v Josh Sparkes>How quick is it? When is it coming?
Is it done?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42616-0
02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:47.152
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm applying in spreadsheet.
Is this client e-billing?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42616-1
02:26:47.152 --> 02:26:50.500
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a question we're asked a lot of
time.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42651-0
02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:56.046
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's on my invoice. Yes,
they can track that themselves if they go</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42651-1
02:26:56.046 --> 02:26:59.390
<v Josh Sparkes>into three and see our comments,
but they don't do that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42651-2
02:26:59.390 --> 02:27:04.141
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's a common one that we have a
look back and forth, but they can do that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42651-3
02:27:04.141 --> 02:27:06.780
<v Josh Sparkes>They can, they can do that themselves,
yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42710-0
02:27:06.820 --> 02:27:10.482
<v Josh Sparkes>But we tried to roll out and give me that
information.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42671-0
02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:12.620
<v Mark Sedgey>That I oh, actually, that's interesting.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42710-1
02:27:10.482 --> 02:27:13.412
<v Josh Sparkes>I when they send an e-mail to us,
it sends.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42710-2
02:27:13.412 --> 02:27:18.338
<v Josh Sparkes>There is an e-mail that tells them if you
want to see your status of you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42710-3
02:27:18.338 --> 02:27:23.332
<v Josh Sparkes>If you're checking your status,
this run this report and it will show you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42710-4
02:27:23.332 --> 02:27:26.660
<v Josh Sparkes>It's quick to ask,
presumably in the behavioural.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42716-0
02:27:26.660 --> 02:27:29.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, there is.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42765-0
02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:33.309
<v Mark Sedgey>But this, this mirrors, sorry team,
this kind of mirrors some of what the HR</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42765-1
02:27:33.309 --> 02:27:38.837
<v Mark Sedgey>folks were saying about, you know,
the not how should I say the reticence of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42765-2
02:27:38.837 --> 02:27:42.498
<v Mark Sedgey>self-helping.
It's easier to chivy and and this is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42739-0
02:27:39.620 --> 02:27:40.300
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42765-3
02:27:42.498 --> 02:27:47.380
<v Mark Sedgey>again telling for us that maybe in the
organizational change shift.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42816-0
02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:49.972
<v Mark Sedgey>That that's required to say,
actually guys,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42816-1
02:27:49.972 --> 02:27:54.565
<v Mark Sedgey>the amount of failure demand that you
draw because you don't help yourselves,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42816-2
02:27:54.565 --> 02:27:57.392
<v Mark Sedgey>you know,
cost the organisation X or something.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42816-3
02:27:57.392 --> 02:27:59.806
<v Mark Sedgey>You know,
it's that beginning to do that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42816-4
02:27:59.806 --> 02:28:04.105
<v Mark Sedgey>positioning piece with data rather than
just, you know what we perceive.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42816-5
02:28:04.105 --> 02:28:06.460
<v Mark Sedgey>It'll be nice to back it with some data.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42844-0
02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:10.866
<v Mark Sedgey>To show that anyway,
it's just something to think about in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42844-1
02:28:10.866 --> 02:28:14.994
<v Mark Sedgey>terms of alternative dashboarding for the
benefit of, you know,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42844-2
02:28:14.994 --> 02:28:17.380
<v Mark Sedgey>leadership choices and conversations.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42892-0
02:28:18.340 --> 02:28:21.457
<v Josh Sparkes>And that would help.
I have a monthly catch up with our</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42892-1
02:28:21.457 --> 02:28:25.242
<v Josh Sparkes>operations manager who's basically like
looks after the London PES.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42892-2
02:28:25.242 --> 02:28:29.639
<v Josh Sparkes>So it'd be a good opportunity if I had
that information to feed it back and be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42892-3
02:28:29.639 --> 02:28:33.145
<v Josh Sparkes>like this PE has asked the question for
the last three months.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42892-4
02:28:33.145 --> 02:28:35.260
<v Josh Sparkes>They've had the same information, yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42921-0
02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:39.659
<v Josh Sparkes>So I can break that behaviour. Yeah,
it's those insights that we're saying</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42885-0
02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:36.540
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah, exactly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42921-1
02:28:39.659 --> 02:28:43.511
<v Josh Sparkes>that you can give back for that
organisational change and behaviours and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42921-2
02:28:43.511 --> 02:28:45.833
<v Josh Sparkes>habits.
And you said they they could do it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42921-3
02:28:45.833 --> 02:28:49.580
<v Josh Sparkes>but they don't because it's easier for
for them it feels good as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42946-0
02:28:55.300 --> 02:29:00.070
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, we can have, you know,
your day-to-day numbers,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42946-1
02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:04.660
<v Josh Sparkes>outstanding SMAS tasks,
all that can be displayed.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42948-0
02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:07.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42966-0
02:29:07.460 --> 02:29:07.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42990-0
02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:13.981
<v Josh Sparkes>We cause analysis,
you know things for rejection rates or</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42990-1
02:29:13.981 --> 02:29:18.530
<v Josh Sparkes>rejection rates going down every month.
You know we can track that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42990-2
02:29:18.530 --> 02:29:22.678
<v Josh Sparkes>but that's lots of information that you
can start to display.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/42990-3
02:29:22.678 --> 02:29:25.220
<v Josh Sparkes>We got reasons in there as well if we.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43012-0
02:29:26.420 --> 02:29:31.427
<v Josh Sparkes>I think Mark alluded to it.
This is your day-to-day activity plus you</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43012-1
02:29:31.427 --> 02:29:34.860
<v Josh Sparkes>can have some post activity reporting
comments.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43017-0
02:29:39.460 --> 02:29:41.500
<v Josh Sparkes>That's helpful. Thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43077-0
02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:46.286
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
it's a place to place to start and to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43077-1
02:29:46.286 --> 02:29:51.026
<v Josh Sparkes>move on the I think the final bit really
and it's it's more for information.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43077-2
02:29:51.026 --> 02:29:55.766
<v Josh Sparkes>This is what we're starting to populate
for user stories based on what we've</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43077-3
02:29:55.766 --> 02:29:59.152
<v Josh Sparkes>gathered today.
So we've gathered all the information,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43077-4
02:29:59.152 --> 02:30:01.860
<v Josh Sparkes>we're able to start talking about what
the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43119-0
02:30:01.940 --> 02:30:07.067
<v Josh Sparkes>What the setup should be and this has got
with the language that we're driving into</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43119-1
02:30:07.067 --> 02:30:10.241
<v Josh Sparkes>a service,
you know as e-billing we do this so that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43119-2
02:30:10.241 --> 02:30:15.063
<v Josh Sparkes>you can do that to an aid this is that
type of language that we want to to get</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43119-3
02:30:15.063 --> 02:30:17.260
<v Josh Sparkes>to. So it's very service orientated.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43158-0
02:30:17.460 --> 02:30:23.157
<v Josh Sparkes>And over the next post workshops,
we'll take all these discussions today to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43158-1
02:30:23.157 --> 02:30:28.703
<v Josh Sparkes>put them into this sort of structure
through your onboarding and awarding</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43158-2
02:30:28.703 --> 02:30:33.500
<v Josh Sparkes>homekeeper invoice and you'll get this
feed like this with the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43196-0
02:30:33.860 --> 02:30:37.769
<v Josh Sparkes>Assignment groups as well,
sort of growing those stories as a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43196-1
02:30:37.769 --> 02:30:41.236
<v Josh Sparkes>service. Yeah,
I took a stab at some of them. Anyways,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43196-2
02:30:41.236 --> 02:30:45.964
<v Josh Sparkes>you can probably use speed read them,
but that's the sort of language that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43196-3
02:30:45.964 --> 02:30:51.071
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll be using as part of the service.
This is the same format as we're going to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43196-4
02:30:51.071 --> 02:30:53.340
<v Josh Sparkes>be receiving for ask people as well.</v>

02:30:58.204 --> 02:31:02.500
<v Josh Sparkes>We took the same as a consolidated.
First time seeing that. Oh, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43265-0
02:31:03.620 --> 02:31:08.138
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep. And finally, finally,
so we've got in a couple of weeks the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43265-1

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43265-2
02:31:13.559 --> 02:31:17.660
<v Josh Sparkes>the standard SLAS,
how we're going to manage that and then</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43265-3
02:31:17.660 --> 02:31:22.178
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll talk integrations as well.
We spoke a little bit about it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43265-4
02:31:22.178 --> 02:31:23.220
<v Josh Sparkes>but we need to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43292-0
02:31:23.300 --> 02:31:29.062
<v Josh Sparkes>Deep dive into what's the what's the best
thing to do, what's possible to do,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43292-1

So we look forward to those. But for now,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43292-2
02:31:33.643 --> 02:31:38.001
<v Josh Sparkes>that's it. I think we're all happy. Yeah.
Yeah. Excellent.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43292-3
02:31:38.001 --> 02:31:40.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you very much for all of that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43293-0

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43323-1
02:31:58.027 --> 02:32:06.780
<v Josh Sparkes>I haven't seen the bottom of the boards.
Yeah, that was great.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43333-0
02:32:07.140 --> 02:32:12.925
<v Josh Sparkes>That was the other thing I was going to
see. I just won't see it for the ball.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43333-1
02:32:12.925 --> 02:32:16.220
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, for the balls.
I said that's the ball.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43342-0

<v Mark Sedgey>Sorry, Josh, what are we?
What are we moving on to now?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43364-0
02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:22.420
<v Josh Sparkes>It just it's not a bug.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43371-0
02:33:23.940 --> 02:33:27.340
<v Josh Sparkes>We are doing something, Ma.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43392-0

<v Josh Sparkes>Good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43392-1
02:33:30.557 --> 02:33:34.820
<v Mark Sedgey>are we done or are we not done?
What are we doing?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43399-0
02:33:34.660 --> 02:33:37.082
<v Josh Sparkes>No,
Lauren's gonna show us how the the bot</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43399-1
02:33:37.082 --> 02:33:39.899
<v Josh Sparkes>works.
She's gonna share screen in a in a moment,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43400-0
02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:40.740
<v Mark Sedgey>Ah, very good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43399-2
02:33:39.899 --> 02:33:40.180
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43401-0
02:33:49.860 --> 02:33:50.380
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43406-0
02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:54.620
<v Josh Sparkes>Because we're taking two sets of data.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43421-0
02:33:57.380 --> 02:34:02.661
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll take that three e-data that we
pulled out and then we also extracted our</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43421-1
02:34:02.661 --> 02:34:07.340
<v Josh Sparkes>timekeeps already existing within our
portals, so to that three data.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43448-0
02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:26.089
<v Josh Sparkes>Extremely slow. So clear name,
client name shows a matter,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43448-1
02:34:26.089 --> 02:34:34.220
<v Josh Sparkes>the timekeeper, ID, their individual,
their name, their rank, so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43489-0
02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:38.632
<v Josh Sparkes>Training, the date that they logged,
the time,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43489-1
02:34:38.632 --> 02:34:43.460
<v Josh Sparkes>the date worked and there's the data.
So the time card currency.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43489-2
02:34:43.460 --> 02:34:48.066
<v Josh Sparkes>So what currency they're looking in the
hours, the work rate.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43489-3
02:34:48.066 --> 02:34:53.340
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's the the grade rate and then
we've got the standard rate, so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43493-0
02:34:54.380 --> 02:34:57.900
<v Josh Sparkes>What's the reference standard?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43496-0
02:34:59.020 --> 02:35:00.860
<v Josh Sparkes>And have been.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43498-0
02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:04.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Mhm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43507-0
02:35:05.300 --> 02:35:08.740
<v Josh Sparkes>The data that we extracted from the
portal to the legal franc up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43515-0
02:35:09.620 --> 02:35:12.940
<v Josh Sparkes>So his stuff I was got multiple tasks
with him.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43531-0
02:35:30.820 --> 02:35:33.540
<v Josh Sparkes>So at the bottom here we've got all our
clients that we've got.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43576-0
02:35:35.380 --> 02:35:40.090
<v Josh Sparkes>The rates also they're extracted per
client. So this will show name, ID,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43576-1
02:35:40.090 --> 02:35:43.315
<v Josh Sparkes>their approved rate,
the date it's expected from.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43576-2
02:35:43.315 --> 02:35:47.638
<v Josh Sparkes>So that comes into place.
A lot of our our rates change on the 1st</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43576-3
02:35:47.638 --> 02:35:52.540
<v Josh Sparkes>of May and everyone gets promoted as well.
So you need to put that date in.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43610-0
02:35:52.900 --> 02:35:57.084
<v Josh Sparkes>That will then avoid the previous rates
that are in the system as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43610-1
02:35:57.084 --> 02:36:01.268
<v Josh Sparkes>So that is very important to make sure
we're putting that in correctly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43610-2
02:36:01.268 --> 02:36:04.581
<v Josh Sparkes>It's then got the currency that is in
country, how many,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43610-3
02:36:04.581 --> 02:36:07.660
<v Josh Sparkes>the classification and the years post
qualification.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43622-0
02:36:07.940 --> 02:36:12.116
<v Josh Sparkes>So they'll be submitted on each tab from
different clients.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43622-1
02:36:12.116 --> 02:36:14.900
<v Josh Sparkes>Please take both of those two documents.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43625-0
02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:18.220
<v Josh Sparkes>This is my fault.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43627-0
02:36:21.980 --> 02:36:22.620
<v Josh Sparkes>And.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43642-0
02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:31.900
<v Josh Sparkes>Selects the portal. What we're doing.
So we've got collaborating.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43644-0
02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:37.500
<v Josh Sparkes>Log in.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43646-0
02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:41.780
<v Josh Sparkes>It's easy when I go to screen.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43655-0
02:36:52.540 --> 02:36:55.620
<v Josh Sparkes>the data.
So that would be the tracker data.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43659-0
02:37:03.020 --> 02:37:04.420
<v Josh Sparkes>It's reading data.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43664-0
02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:08.900
<v Josh Sparkes>It's been and it does its thing.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43707-0
02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:16.035
<v Josh Sparkes>The reports then come in to show up and
it will create an individual ticket for</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43707-1
02:37:16.035 --> 02:37:19.494
<v Josh Sparkes>individual report per client on that
spreadsheet.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43707-2
02:37:19.494 --> 02:37:24.683
<v Josh Sparkes>So then it will tell us the difference in
validations of like this rate is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43707-3
02:37:24.683 --> 02:37:29.940
<v Josh Sparkes>incorrect or you this rate is 400 they're
now 550 you need to update it or.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43740-0
02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:34.621
<v Josh Sparkes>So this person's the trainee and now
their title's an associate.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43740-1
02:37:34.621 --> 02:37:40.260
<v Josh Sparkes>It will fix if there's any name changes.
So it's quite helpful people changing</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43740-2
02:37:40.260 --> 02:37:44.900
<v Josh Sparkes>their names. Yeah, once you click on one,
one ticket per client.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43756-0
02:37:45.620 --> 02:37:50.652
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, OK.
Takes a while for it to come through.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43756-1
02:37:50.652 --> 02:37:56.340
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe a couple of minutes.
So once I get the final.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43775-0
02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:07.049
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just to deal with all building rate
changes that have occurred because of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43775-1
02:38:07.049 --> 02:38:09.620
<v Josh Sparkes>like rate grade changes or rate.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43804-0
02:38:11.900 --> 02:38:15.142
<v Josh Sparkes>Incorrect. What's in the portal here?
Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43804-1
02:38:15.142 --> 02:38:20.445
<v Josh Sparkes>Did those spreadsheets have like on the
original contrast at all? Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43804-2
02:38:20.445 --> 02:38:25.160
<v Josh Sparkes>Was that hundreds of rows per tab?
Thousands of rows? Hundreds.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43804-3
02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:26.780
<v Josh Sparkes>These are not too bad.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43806-0
02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:28.340
<v Josh Sparkes>It says listening.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43817-0
02:38:31.020 --> 02:38:35.671
<v Josh Sparkes>492 All right, we have.
That's going to lame if we're looking at</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43817-1
02:38:35.671 --> 02:38:39.820
<v Josh Sparkes>like Goldman Sachs,
which is every single office we have.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43852-0
02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:44.273
<v Josh Sparkes>About 3000,
four thousand lines of data coming out of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43852-1
02:38:44.273 --> 02:38:48.242
<v Josh Sparkes>that portal rates.
So it's a lot to check and we have about</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43852-2
02:38:48.242 --> 02:38:52.145
<v Josh Sparkes>100 to 200 rates.
Dion is working on those that client per</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43852-3
02:38:52.145 --> 02:38:55.453
<v Josh Sparkes>month.
So to validate that for yourself is, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43852-4
02:38:55.453 --> 02:38:56.180
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43884-0
02:38:56.540 --> 02:39:02.173
<v Josh Sparkes>Many tickets would that normally be if
you think the example you've got here</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43884-1
02:39:02.173 --> 02:39:05.392
<v Josh Sparkes>long where you're saying there's 400
lines,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43884-2
02:39:05.392 --> 02:39:10.220
<v Josh Sparkes>it's evaluating and telling us what the
potential rejections are,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43884-3
02:39:10.220 --> 02:39:12.780
<v Josh Sparkes>how many tickets are being created.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43886-0
02:39:14.020 --> 02:39:14.740
<v Josh Sparkes>Roughly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43889-0
02:39:16.260 --> 02:39:16.900
<v Josh Sparkes>On average.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43920-0
02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:25.036
<v Josh Sparkes>I think in terms of these Goldman Sachs
is our place to charge because that's the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43920-1
02:39:25.036 --> 02:39:29.964
<v Josh Sparkes>first one we've done,
which are about 20 to 40 invoices per</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43920-2
02:39:29.964 --> 02:39:33.660
<v Josh Sparkes>month and I'd say about 2015 to 20
rejected.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43948-0
02:39:35.220 --> 02:39:41.160
<v Josh Sparkes>That's reduced it down by having this
process with reducing our rejection</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43948-1
02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:47.100
<v Josh Sparkes>management rate by like 90 hours per year,
just by having this new place.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43977-0
02:39:48.060 --> 02:39:55.309
<v Josh Sparkes>So how many rejections on like less than
going that high to one or two? Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43977-1
02:39:55.309 --> 02:40:02.744
<v Josh Sparkes>it'll go down to like two to four a month.
Yeah. So we've done the next branch,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/43977-2
02:40:02.744 --> 02:40:03.580
<v Josh Sparkes>which is.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44016-0
02:40:03.580 --> 02:40:06.843
<v Josh Sparkes>Legal tracker.
So that was about 250 we saved hours</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44016-1
02:40:06.843 --> 02:40:10.608
<v Josh Sparkes>management rejections.
So that by focusing heavily on these</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44016-2
02:40:10.608 --> 02:40:15.439
<v Josh Sparkes>upstream processes, rejection rates,
capturing reasons for rejection because</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44016-3
02:40:15.439 --> 02:40:19.392
<v Josh Sparkes>most of this time won't get billed until
the end of this year,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44016-4
02:40:19.392 --> 02:40:20.960
<v Josh Sparkes>so if we're doing it now.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44031-0
02:40:21.580 --> 02:40:26.584
<v Josh Sparkes>While we've got a little bit of space,
then it's going to save us in the.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44031-1
02:40:26.584 --> 02:40:29.694
<v Josh Sparkes>What's it about?
Do you know what it's built?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44031-2
02:40:29.694 --> 02:40:32.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it Microsoft? Oh, I didn't know.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44056-0
02:40:33.340 --> 02:40:35.736
<v Parik Narain>Can I just sorry,
can I just check that Excel sheet?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44056-1
02:40:35.736 --> 02:40:38.945
<v Parik Narain>What is the source of that sheet again?
Sorry, I might have missed it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44056-2
02:40:38.945 --> 02:40:41.340
<v Parik Narain>Is it the client portals or is it some
other system?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44081-0
02:40:41.020 --> 02:40:45.213
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got two,
so it'll be one from extracted from the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44081-1
02:40:45.213 --> 02:40:49.100
<v Josh Sparkes>client portal,
one will be extracted from three E.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44086-0
02:40:46.700 --> 02:40:50.451
<v Parik Narain>Three. Got it.
And then you import them into into show L</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44086-1
02:40:50.451 --> 02:40:52.820
<v Parik Narain>as you're doing well to create this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44109-0
02:40:51.180 --> 02:40:58.054
<v Josh Sparkes>Put it into automation anywhere.
It does a validation and then the reports</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44109-1
02:40:58.054 --> 02:41:00.620
<v Josh Sparkes>come in to show them. Sorry.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44135-0
02:40:59.340 --> 02:41:03.301
<v Parik Narain>So automation anywhere.
So so when you clicked on that button</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44135-1
02:41:03.301 --> 02:41:06.878
<v Parik Narain>because I could I could recognize the the
orange lines.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44135-2
02:41:06.878 --> 02:41:11.733
<v Parik Narain>So is is Shovel allow connected to the
automation anywhere to automate this</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44135-3
02:41:11.733 --> 02:41:12.180
<v Parik Narain>import?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44164-0
02:41:12.300 --> 02:41:16.579
<v Josh Sparkes>It well sends the reports to an e-mail,
so this will just send it just sends it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44164-1
02:41:16.579 --> 02:41:20.911
<v Josh Sparkes>to e-mail in team which is on our show.
So it will automatically create a ticket</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44164-2
02:41:20.911 --> 02:41:21.820
<v Josh Sparkes>from the mailbox.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44178-0
02:41:22.340 --> 02:41:24.677
<v Parik Narain>Got it.
But you have to attach it manually still,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44178-1
02:41:24.677 --> 02:41:27.900
<v Parik Narain>right? It does does not do automatically.
It still has to be got it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44180-0
02:41:25.420 --> 02:41:29.401
<v Josh Sparkes>No, I didn't. Yeah,
we might need to explain that. Oh,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44180-1
02:41:29.401 --> 02:41:29.980
<v Josh Sparkes>because.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44196-0
02:41:31.900 --> 02:41:38.055
<v Mark Sedgey>And the ticket and the tickets are
literally just to do to fix or go in and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44185-0
02:41:32.660 --> 02:41:33.140
<v Josh Sparkes>Mhm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44194-0
02:41:36.740 --> 02:41:36.980
<v Josh Sparkes>2.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44196-1
02:41:38.055 --> 02:41:38.540
<v Mark Sedgey>amend.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44204-0
02:41:39.180 --> 02:41:41.700
<v Josh Sparkes>To check. So what was your?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44226-0
02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:44.620
<v Mark Sedgey>To check, yeah, so they're triggered.
They're they're an action ticket to say</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44226-1
02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:48.820
<v Mark Sedgey>go and amend, correct,
whatever as a result of what it's found.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44228-0
02:41:47.180 --> 02:41:51.380
<v Josh Sparkes>This will be the file and then wipe me
out.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44265-0
02:41:58.060 --> 02:42:03.609
<v Josh Sparkes>It tells us this one when you've got the
leveling I think is we need to look at</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44265-1
02:42:03.609 --> 02:42:07.077
<v Josh Sparkes>that. Yeah,
actually the engineers tell us what's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44265-2
02:42:07.077 --> 02:42:12.417
<v Josh Sparkes>wrong. So I'll keep those made right.
So this one the rate is so the portals</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44256-0
02:42:09.820 --> 02:42:12.140
<v Mark Sedgey>Uh, yeah. Yeah. OK, Yep.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44265-3
02:42:12.417 --> 02:42:13.180
<v Josh Sparkes>are 15 but.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44275-0
02:42:14.220 --> 02:42:18.161
<v Josh Sparkes>This now they're charging 460,
so we're gonna have to update that in my</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44275-1
02:42:18.161 --> 02:42:19.420
<v Josh Sparkes>must have matriculated.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44306-0
02:42:20.460 --> 02:42:23.579
<v Josh Sparkes>All the rates have changed.
And then again,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44306-1
02:42:23.579 --> 02:42:29.460
<v Josh Sparkes>this time has got the rate and then he's
going to say 3 E rate 315, also rate 220.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44287-0
02:42:24.220 --> 02:42:24.660
<v Mark Sedgey>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44310-0
02:42:27.580 --> 02:42:30.690
<v Parik Narain>And these validations,
are they built in Shervin or are they</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44310-1
02:42:30.690 --> 02:42:33.340
<v Parik Narain>done by automation anywhere the
validations around?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44361-0
02:42:32.060 --> 02:42:35.163
<v Josh Sparkes>They're done by,
they're done by automation anywhere.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44361-1
02:42:35.163 --> 02:42:38.381
<v Josh Sparkes>So again it come from so it could look
and be like, no,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44318-0
02:42:35.420 --> 02:42:36.020
<v Parik Narain>Got it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44361-2
02:42:38.381 --> 02:42:41.024
<v Josh Sparkes>this isn't a training rate,
that's incorrect.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44361-3
02:42:41.024 --> 02:42:45.620
<v Josh Sparkes>It then triggers us still in to the EE.
We can switch around and be like what's</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44361-4
02:42:45.620 --> 02:42:48.780
<v Josh Sparkes>going on with this rate?
Has this been done correctly?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44405-0
02:42:48.940 --> 02:42:54.058
<v Josh Sparkes>Can help in the long term instead of us
having to reissue invoices that have got</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44356-0
02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:50.100
<v Parik Narain>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44405-1
02:42:54.058 --> 02:42:58.355
<v Josh Sparkes>the wrong rates. We had one.
It was for one of our banking clients.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44405-2
02:42:58.355 --> 02:43:02.209
<v Josh Sparkes>The rate was three,
no 665 and we were putting it in and the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44405-3
02:43:02.209 --> 02:43:05.620
<v Josh Sparkes>client was like, no, this is wrong,
it should be 655.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44446-0
02:43:05.980 --> 02:43:09.781
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's just picking up little things
like that and that stopped it before the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44446-1
02:43:09.781 --> 02:43:12.956
<v Josh Sparkes>bill even came through.
It was picked up from this process. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44446-2
02:43:12.956 --> 02:43:15.891
<v Josh Sparkes>and see if the one's timekeeper has no
rates in meta portal.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44446-3
02:43:15.891 --> 02:43:19.836
<v Josh Sparkes>Are you then putting the rate from those
columns on the left or are you taking it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44446-4
02:43:19.836 --> 02:43:20.220
<v Josh Sparkes>from 3D?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44485-0
02:43:20.940 --> 02:43:24.610
<v Josh Sparkes>We're taking it from this report,
so we'll look at that and then go in and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44485-1
02:43:24.610 --> 02:43:27.985
<v Josh Sparkes>I can just put it on to the form.
We'll just do a quick sense check.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44485-2
02:43:27.985 --> 02:43:31.703
<v Josh Sparkes>So I normally just go through and make
sure the rates are matching the rate</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44485-3
02:43:31.703 --> 02:43:34.100
<v Josh Sparkes>cards and then send it on to the team to
upload.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44505-0
02:43:35.420 --> 02:43:39.422
<v Josh Sparkes>And then they'll do their check as well
to make sure because they're more closer</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44505-1
02:43:39.422 --> 02:43:42.929
<v Josh Sparkes>to the the data will be like, Oh no,
this one's on a matter exception,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44505-2
02:43:42.929 --> 02:43:44.460
<v Josh Sparkes>so they don't need to match up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44551-0
02:43:49.420 --> 02:43:53.324
<v Josh Sparkes>But as we've said,
you know the time of mobile and rates</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44551-1
02:43:53.324 --> 02:43:59.009
<v Josh Sparkes>management service that we're suggesting
you get these rates matters, upload them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44551-2
02:43:59.009 --> 02:44:04.420
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a lot of activities we said that
you can do in order to get this error</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44551-3
02:44:04.420 --> 02:44:08.460
<v Josh Sparkes>rate down as well,
but this is proactive as you said time.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44580-0
02:44:08.580 --> 02:44:12.239
<v Josh Sparkes>If they were, you know,
you'll review professional development</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44580-1
02:44:12.239 --> 02:44:16.652
<v Josh Sparkes>reviews when your bonuses and your
increases and your rates probably go up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44580-2
02:44:16.652 --> 02:44:21.240
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just managing it during those times.
That's very good. Thank you. Indeed.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44580-3
02:44:21.240 --> 02:44:23.620
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry, Lauren, this is monthly, isn't it?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44621-0
02:44:24.260 --> 02:44:28.181
<v Josh Sparkes>We try and do it twice a month.
We do it once this month because it's up</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44621-1
02:44:28.181 --> 02:44:30.759
<v Josh Sparkes>here.
So we just need that automation anywhere.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44621-2
02:44:30.759 --> 02:44:34.411
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that what it's called? Yep.
So we've got subscriptions for that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44621-3
02:44:34.411 --> 02:44:38.708
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have one people to be able to just
replicate Casey's then and ServiceNow.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44621-4
02:44:38.708 --> 02:44:41.500
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what we're looking for. Yeah,
for that data.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44623-0
02:44:44.830 --> 02:44:47.110
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44636-0
02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:57.100
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good. Yeah. OK.
I'd like to see my baby.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44636-1
02:44:57.100 --> 02:45:04.220
<v Josh Sparkes>This is what we would like to put as
knowledge.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44642-0
02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:10.860
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you're gonna show me check this
as well with your matrix.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44643-0
02:45:13.340 --> 02:45:13.940
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44660-0
02:45:29.660 --> 02:45:36.228
<v Josh Sparkes>I need the tracker. I need the tracker.
See, it stopped, right?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44660-1
02:45:36.228 --> 02:45:39.820
<v Josh Sparkes>So this is our client requirements.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44671-0
02:45:41.460 --> 02:45:46.188
<v Josh Sparkes>It has been item is listed.
It then goes into the client with it went</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44671-1
02:45:46.188 --> 02:45:49.700
<v Josh Sparkes>to the separate entities within the
client as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44713-0
02:45:50.940 --> 02:45:54.776
<v Josh Sparkes>No, we need to report you to the MSA,
whether they're mandatory,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44713-1
02:45:54.776 --> 02:45:59.025
<v Josh Sparkes>whether we can do our generic ones.
It's then got billing data as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44713-2
02:45:59.025 --> 02:46:03.746
<v Josh Sparkes>So this is shared with all of our billing
teams, our original finance services,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44713-3
02:46:03.746 --> 02:46:08.171
<v Josh Sparkes>so they know exactly how to create
invoices that are going to be compliant</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44713-4
02:46:08.171 --> 02:46:08.820
<v Josh Sparkes>with these.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44746-0
02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:12.845
<v Josh Sparkes>Clients.
We've also got whether they require a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44746-1
02:46:12.845 --> 02:46:16.751
<v Josh Sparkes>matter ID.
We put in what the client uses it in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44746-2
02:46:16.751 --> 02:46:21.227
<v Josh Sparkes>their terms.
So if it's a matter ID and LMN number and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44746-3
02:46:21.227 --> 02:46:25.540
<v Josh Sparkes>tracker ID,
we try and keep it as specific for them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44762-0
02:46:25.900 --> 02:46:32.071
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't want any client specifics,
so if it's monthly billing cycles,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44762-1
02:46:32.071 --> 02:46:35.460
<v Josh Sparkes>yearly billing cycles, the other stuff.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44804-0
02:46:37.020 --> 02:46:41.867
<v Josh Sparkes>Then if the client needs to be a detailed
PDF or they will accept it just as a</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44804-1
02:46:41.867 --> 02:46:46.529
<v Josh Sparkes>front page, this is your fee amount.
We then have chargeable disbursements.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44804-2
02:46:46.529 --> 02:46:51.620
<v Josh Sparkes>So some clients will only like what they
call hard disbursements, so council fees.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44834-0
02:46:52.780 --> 02:46:59.447
<v Josh Sparkes>Search fees. They won't pay for travel,
meals, printing, things like that,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44834-1
02:46:59.447 --> 02:47:03.892
<v Josh Sparkes>phone calls.
We've got the ego of who manages the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44834-2
02:47:03.892 --> 02:47:10.380
<v Josh Sparkes>clients and go to Rest World Pay back
submission type. That's Leeds PDF.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44880-0
02:47:11.900 --> 02:47:16.372
<v Josh Sparkes>And make sure requirements are any notes
that we have that helps us with our</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44880-1
02:47:16.372 --> 02:47:20.844
<v Josh Sparkes>uploads and then on the chart as well.
So not all of this information go in.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44880-2
02:47:20.844 --> 02:47:24.213
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'd like probably like to hide the
responsible legal,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44880-3
02:47:24.213 --> 02:47:27.175
<v Josh Sparkes>but the submission type when we
distribute it out,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44880-4
02:47:27.175 --> 02:47:30.020
<v Josh Sparkes>we take those columns out because we
don't need.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44913-0
02:47:31.100 --> 02:47:37.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Otherwise we're going to have in in
inundated from the business direct</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44913-1
02:47:37.537 --> 02:47:43.611
<v Josh Sparkes>messaging, but this is what we show.
So you currently manage this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44913-2
02:47:43.611 --> 02:47:49.140
<v Josh Sparkes>How often is it updated as we go as we
get more information?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44965-0
02:47:49.180 --> 02:47:52.486
<v Josh Sparkes>Clients change all the time,
so one month we can do it fine.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44965-1
02:47:52.486 --> 02:47:56.333
<v Josh Sparkes>Next month they'll be like no,
we're changed to monthly billing cycles</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44965-2
02:47:56.333 --> 02:48:00.289
<v Josh Sparkes>or yeah, we're fine doing a PDF. No,
we want details so it gets updated.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44965-3
02:48:00.289 --> 02:48:03.270
<v Josh Sparkes>We try and share it on a monthly basis
with the teams.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44965-4
02:48:03.270 --> 02:48:07.497
<v Josh Sparkes>We have got a e-mail in Teams channel
which I like to try and keep it updated</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/44965-5
02:48:07.497 --> 02:48:08.580
<v Josh Sparkes>as much as possible.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45019-0
02:48:08.940 --> 02:48:13.619
<v Josh Sparkes>Drop in number to have it on a knowledge
page would be really helpful just to have</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45019-1
02:48:13.619 --> 02:48:16.944
<v Josh Sparkes>it in that one place.
I don't have to keep remembering who</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45019-2
02:48:16.944 --> 02:48:20.270
<v Josh Sparkes>needs it, who's got it,
who's got the most recent version.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45019-3
02:48:20.270 --> 02:48:24.440
<v Josh Sparkes>So we probably just need to understand
the groups of who need to see that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45019-4
02:48:24.440 --> 02:48:28.780
<v Josh Sparkes>information and and there will be an
overarching process, so there'll be an.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45063-0
02:48:28.900 --> 02:48:33.196
<v Josh Sparkes>Prize knowledge manager that's recruited
for ServiceNow for the knowledge</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45063-1
02:48:33.196 --> 02:48:36.157
<v Josh Sparkes>management tool and updating the content
etcetera.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45063-2
02:48:36.157 --> 02:48:40.801
<v Josh Sparkes>The process around how that happens may
change slightly in terms of when you've</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45063-3
02:48:40.801 --> 02:48:43.703
<v Josh Sparkes>got updates,
you might need to pass them on to be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45063-4
02:48:43.703 --> 02:48:44.980
<v Josh Sparkes>updated in the system.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45073-0
02:48:45.260 --> 02:48:50.001
<v Josh Sparkes>But that is something that we can manage.
So we'd probably just need to capture</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45073-1
02:48:50.001 --> 02:48:51.660
<v Josh Sparkes>some requirements to see it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45084-0
02:48:52.660 --> 02:48:57.732
<v Josh Sparkes>Want it type thing or if you want it
popping up with a particular request,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45084-1
02:48:57.732 --> 02:48:58.340
<v Josh Sparkes>etcetera.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45101-0
02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:04.640
<v Josh Sparkes>That that losing question is that how
often we can play all of these because it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45101-1
02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:05.620
<v Josh Sparkes>could be weekly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45152-0
02:49:07.180 --> 02:49:11.141
<v Josh Sparkes>It's going to be too much. Yeah,
but it's the ownership of the actual</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45152-1
02:49:11.141 --> 02:49:14.479
<v Josh Sparkes>knowledge article can still be with
yourself and the team,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45152-2
02:49:14.479 --> 02:49:18.044
<v Josh Sparkes>so it doesn't have to.
It's something just what the enterprise</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45152-3
02:49:18.044 --> 02:49:20.590
<v Josh Sparkes>knowledge management will set the
standards,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45152-4
02:49:20.590 --> 02:49:25.173
<v Josh Sparkes>potentially build approval workflows in
there, governs how that process is done,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45152-5
02:49:25.173 --> 02:49:26.700
<v Josh Sparkes>but you can still own that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45166-0
02:49:26.780 --> 02:49:30.054
<v Josh Sparkes>And then publishing those.
I'll base the article can still be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45166-1
02:49:30.054 --> 02:49:32.694
<v Josh Sparkes>resolved.
It just needs to align to set standards</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45166-2
02:49:32.694 --> 02:49:34.700
<v Josh Sparkes>there that we were going to be saying.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45174-0
02:49:35.660 --> 02:49:39.940
<v Josh Sparkes>This is our tracker. Oh,
there's a hand up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45216-0
02:49:39.100 --> 02:49:42.095
<v Parik Narain>Can I just sorry,
just on the previous sheet which was</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45216-1
02:49:42.095 --> 02:49:46.397
<v Parik Narain>having the billing details and the client
details, did I understand correctly?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45189-0
02:49:43.860 --> 02:49:44.220
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45216-2
02:49:46.397 --> 02:49:48.956
<v Parik Narain>It's a fully man fully manually managed
sheet.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45216-3
02:49:48.956 --> 02:49:51.460
<v Parik Narain>It does not get fed from any other
platforms.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45245-0
02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:52.595
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, no,
this is completely absolutely that is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45245-1
02:49:52.595 --> 02:49:57.466
<v Josh Sparkes>from resource from getting the clients
OCG and from us just working the cases</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45219-0
02:49:54.900 --> 02:49:54.980
<v Parik Narain>So.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45245-2
02:49:57.466 --> 02:50:02.711
<v Josh Sparkes>and the things that we find along the way
because most of the time we don't get the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45245-3
02:50:02.711 --> 02:50:03.460
<v Josh Sparkes>information.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45303-0
02:50:05.100 --> 02:50:07.804
<v Parik Narain>So this must be very must be quite hard,
right? I mean,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45303-1
02:50:07.804 --> 02:50:11.667
<v Parik Narain>if you get a new new client for Ashest,
how would you know if if the client has</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45303-2
02:50:11.667 --> 02:50:14.419
<v Parik Narain>been onboarded?
Do you get an e-mail and then you update</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45303-3
02:50:14.419 --> 02:50:17.220
<v Parik Narain>the sheet saying, oh by the way,
we call this new client,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45310-0
02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:21.046
<v Josh Sparkes>We normally do.
It was part of our boarding process.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45303-4
02:50:17.220 --> 02:50:20.020
<v Parik Narain>let's add it in here.
It must have been added to the CRM.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45310-1
02:50:21.046 --> 02:50:26.100
<v Josh Sparkes>It will be to update this document and
then share it out again.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45309-0
02:50:25.780 --> 02:50:25.900
<v Parik Narain>OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45331-0
02:50:28.460 --> 02:50:32.767
<v Parik Narain>Right. And then combine.
We combine that with three billing set up</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45323-0
02:50:32.380 --> 02:50:32.900
<v Josh Sparkes>Mhm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45331-1
02:50:32.767 --> 02:50:35.980
<v Parik Narain>as well to create this this sheet. OK,
thank you.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45338-0
02:50:37.860 --> 02:50:41.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Can we take that away as well?
Just have to think about this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45369-0
02:50:42.140 --> 02:50:53.121
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like the best. Yeah.
It's the manually on boarding process.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45369-1
02:50:53.121 --> 02:50:58.020
<v Josh Sparkes>How we can. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45409-0
02:50:58.860 --> 02:51:02.754
<v Josh Sparkes>Because this this isn't.
It was right at the beginning when we had</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45409-1
02:51:02.754 --> 02:51:07.170
<v Josh Sparkes>80 clients having 450 try to manage.
This is it's growing arms and legs and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45409-2
02:51:07.170 --> 02:51:11.238
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm like, I can't. I can't anymore.
I said you get standard language,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45409-3
02:51:11.238 --> 02:51:14.899
<v Josh Sparkes>which of the columns, you know,
there's free text. Yeah, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45409-4
02:51:14.899 --> 02:51:16.700
<v Josh Sparkes>I I put that action as part of.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45425-0
02:51:16.780 --> 02:51:23.058
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Thank you. Next meeting is,
is that dashboard that we've got that we</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45425-1
02:51:23.058 --> 02:51:23.660
<v Josh Sparkes>around?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45447-0
02:51:26.060 --> 02:51:31.388
<v Josh Sparkes>So it just shows the weekly stats could
be like to have targets, uploads,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45447-1
02:51:31.388 --> 02:51:35.780
<v Josh Sparkes>25 to 30 invoices per people up and then
have to be monthly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45483-0
02:51:37.180 --> 02:51:40.901
<v Josh Sparkes>As well, what we've done,
it was a bit of friendly competition.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45483-1
02:51:40.901 --> 02:51:43.692
<v Josh Sparkes>He gets the most gets the trophy for the
month,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45483-2
02:51:43.692 --> 02:51:46.367
<v Josh Sparkes>then how stats tracking throughout the
month.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45483-3
02:51:46.367 --> 02:51:49.390
<v Josh Sparkes>So how many days on average we're taking
to upload,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45483-4
02:51:49.390 --> 02:51:52.820
<v Josh Sparkes>how many requests we've received,
how many we've uploaded.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45501-0
02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:57.623
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the percentage of that as well.
Bottom we've got our invoices to be</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45501-1
02:51:57.623 --> 02:52:00.500
<v Josh Sparkes>uploaded.
So these are our new invoices waiting.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45548-0
02:52:02.180 --> 02:52:07.570
<v Josh Sparkes>This data is direct from 3 E, isn't it?
It's not based on chair room. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45548-1
02:52:07.570 --> 02:52:12.817
<v Josh Sparkes>then got all our rejection tables and
then everything that's outstanding.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45548-2
02:52:12.817 --> 02:52:17.780
<v Josh Sparkes>So that includes all our invoices that
we've not been able to submit.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45602-0
02:52:18.140 --> 02:52:21.286
<v Josh Sparkes>And we track it on this one by aging
bucket as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45602-1
02:52:21.286 --> 02:52:24.432
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's from when we receive it and
we're staying.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45602-2
02:52:24.432 --> 02:52:29.241
<v Josh Sparkes>So a lot of our stuff is looking at aging,
trying to reduce this down as much as</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45602-3
02:52:29.241 --> 02:52:32.208
<v Josh Sparkes>possible.
Is is the data live or do you we update</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45602-4
02:52:32.208 --> 02:52:36.660
<v Josh Sparkes>it every morning I would we have got a BI
report that gets updated weekly.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45628-0
02:52:37.020 --> 02:52:42.093
<v Josh Sparkes>But for the Excel with the team,
they can click into their name and see</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45628-1
02:52:42.093 --> 02:52:46.673
<v Josh Sparkes>what's with them. Yeah,
and then they can use Cheryl as a backup</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45628-2
02:52:46.673 --> 02:52:49.420
<v Josh Sparkes>to click on Megan's name, for instance.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45642-0
02:52:51.420 --> 02:52:57.735
<v Josh Sparkes>That will give every rejection to sit
with Megan client name invoice around and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45642-1
02:52:57.735 --> 02:53:00.260
<v Josh Sparkes>then at the end it will show us.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45657-0
02:53:04.620 --> 02:53:13.620
<v Josh Sparkes>The rejection reasons she's got on hold
budget. This incorrect set up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45666-0
02:53:15.020 --> 02:53:19.220
<v Josh Sparkes>So hold on, just a chat.
We said the data's coming from 3D.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45704-0
02:53:20.460 --> 02:53:25.242
<v Josh Sparkes>So is that free free data being put into
the spreadsheet or is it this time and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45704-1
02:53:25.242 --> 02:53:27.991
<v Josh Sparkes>then update? OK,
because you mentioned Chair,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45704-2
02:53:27.991 --> 02:53:32.593
<v Josh Sparkes>I was kind of saying actually, yeah,
we could do that in service now as well</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45704-3
02:53:32.593 --> 02:53:35.940
<v Josh Sparkes>because we'd know which cases you're
getting, but then.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45710-0
02:53:36.220 --> 02:53:39.580
<v Josh Sparkes>You're loading in the data from free as
well as where I'm trying to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45770-0
02:53:40.660 --> 02:53:44.795
<v Josh Sparkes>I would would be stuff direct like agent,
you know we can get everything case</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45770-1
02:53:44.795 --> 02:53:48.983
<v Josh Sparkes>related and anything that's raised for
the team that they're managing as their</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45770-2
02:53:48.983 --> 02:53:52.110
<v Josh Sparkes>workload. No problem.
Well that's that's part of the cases</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45770-3
02:53:52.110 --> 02:53:56.457
<v Josh Sparkes>would be we'll be on ourselves now it's
the the other data that you're putting in</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45770-4
02:53:56.457 --> 02:53:58.100
<v Josh Sparkes>from free. That's the bit that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45776-0
02:53:58.220 --> 02:54:02.340
<v Josh Sparkes>At the moment helping managing it and
comments.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45809-0
02:54:03.740 --> 02:54:08.250
<v Josh Sparkes>So how are you getting this bit though?
As in the cases that's on Cherwell,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45809-1
02:54:08.250 --> 02:54:11.277
<v Josh Sparkes>it's the spreadsheet.
So once we receive the case,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45809-2
02:54:11.277 --> 02:54:14.540
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll go into three,
even industry form if I can take.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45847-0
02:54:21.340 --> 02:54:25.341
<v Josh Sparkes>So part of our queue is triaging.
So we'll just go through whatever is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45847-1
02:54:25.341 --> 02:54:28.552
<v Josh Sparkes>sitting there and there's an upload.
They'll look at it,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45847-2
02:54:28.552 --> 02:54:31.482
<v Josh Sparkes>know who's working on it,
assign it to that person,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45847-3
02:54:31.482 --> 02:54:34.580
<v Josh Sparkes>update it in three. Oh, OK,
so receive data for three.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45852-0
02:54:35.820 --> 02:54:38.220
<v Josh Sparkes>Raise a case, go back into free.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45855-0
02:54:39.540 --> 02:54:40.460
<v Josh Sparkes>Thanks for coming.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45857-0
02:54:42.460 --> 02:54:43.220
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45889-0
02:54:48.460 --> 02:54:53.202
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, please. Thank you.
So we'll receive the ticket into Sherwell.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45889-1
02:54:53.202 --> 02:54:57.023
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, not 3A.
They'll go down to this even in history</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45889-2
02:54:57.023 --> 02:55:01.270
<v Josh Sparkes>form, populate it.
So it'll be date received. Got it. Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45889-3
02:55:01.270 --> 02:55:05.020
<v Josh Sparkes>And then they'll assign it to Evelyn so
it will pay.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45892-0
02:55:05.100 --> 02:55:05.300
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45894-0
02:55:07.260 --> 02:55:10.020
<v Josh Sparkes>in that comment.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45945-0
02:55:11.260 --> 02:55:16.447
<v Josh Sparkes>The ticket number plays up both,
so we put the ticket in there so we can</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45945-1
02:55:16.447 --> 02:55:19.574
<v Josh Sparkes>track it. Yeah,
that's how we can track it.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45945-2
02:55:19.574 --> 02:55:24.050
<v Josh Sparkes>If it gets rejected,
try and find the original case to try and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45945-3
02:55:24.050 --> 02:55:28.100
<v Josh Sparkes>we need to go back to your comments down
here with your.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45961-0
02:55:28.700 --> 02:55:32.927
<v Josh Sparkes>And what's happened? Yes,
with this one projected subject. Yes,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45961-1
02:55:32.927 --> 02:55:38.078
<v Josh Sparkes>we've assigned it to the master team
because we're asking them to contact the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45961-2
02:55:38.078 --> 02:55:38.540
<v Josh Sparkes>client.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45963-0
02:55:39.820 --> 02:55:41.940
<v Josh Sparkes>So any questions?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45991-0
02:55:43.460 --> 02:55:48.984
<v Josh Sparkes>One for us to think about it.
Figure out my solution for this.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45991-1
02:55:48.984 --> 02:55:55.997
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe we should have been on Monday. Yeah,
that's the one that control will get</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45991-2
02:55:55.997 --> 02:56:00.995
<v Josh Sparkes>information. Yes.
So these comments are about the one of</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/45991-3
02:56:00.995 --> 02:56:02.660
<v Josh Sparkes>the credit control.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46030-0
02:56:03.020 --> 02:56:05.975
<v Josh Sparkes>Report.
So it's the same report parameters that</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46030-1
02:56:05.975 --> 02:56:08.930
<v Josh Sparkes>we have,
but it's got different bills that they</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46030-2
02:56:08.930 --> 02:56:12.070
<v Josh Sparkes>look at.
So it'll be like instead of being an even</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46030-3
02:56:12.070 --> 02:56:17.118
<v Josh Sparkes>and they look at their portfolio because
they'll be cross overs although we do it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46030-4
02:56:17.118 --> 02:56:19.580
<v Josh Sparkes>by find they do it by partner I believe.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46033-0
02:56:19.740 --> 02:56:21.460
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's good to.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46036-0
02:56:30.100 --> 02:56:31.260
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I'm just looking.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46073-0
02:56:32.340 --> 02:56:38.922
<v Josh Sparkes>If we can see that, yeah,
the screenshots that you've shared today</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46073-1
02:56:38.922 --> 02:56:46.290
<v Josh Sparkes>along the tops for the columns,
which we can go through for the recording,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46073-2
02:56:46.290 --> 02:56:51.300
<v Josh Sparkes>but just like a drop down to a specific
selection.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46074-0
02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:52.620
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46113-0
02:56:53.580 --> 02:56:56.998
<v Josh Sparkes>I can tidy this up.
This is very slap dash.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46113-1
02:56:56.998 --> 02:57:02.512
<v Josh Sparkes>So it'll be our clients and when with
client which Bolton there on and</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46113-2
02:57:02.512 --> 02:57:08.415
<v Josh Sparkes>locations in Brisbane or Glasgow who is
the responsible either that and the</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46113-3
02:57:08.415 --> 02:57:10.900
<v Josh Sparkes>supporting either there as well.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46120-0
02:57:12.300 --> 02:57:16.700
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can do it more client rest of the
world.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46161-0
02:57:17.700 --> 02:57:22.014
<v Josh Sparkes>Last paper is being split out that way.
Makes more sense or whatever.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46161-1
02:57:22.014 --> 02:57:24.725
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got time to work on it.
May I ask me,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46161-2
02:57:24.725 --> 02:57:29.161
<v Josh Sparkes>this is our client skills matrix.
So this is what we want. So OK, yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46161-3
02:57:29.161 --> 02:57:33.105
<v Josh Sparkes>when we're assigned in,
we'll go through and be like this time,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46161-4
02:57:33.105 --> 02:57:34.460
<v Josh Sparkes>this person. OK, good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46164-0
02:57:34.540 --> 02:57:36.020
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, definitely this one.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46200-0
02:57:37.340 --> 02:57:41.749
<v Josh Sparkes>The out of that skills matrix will be
similar for all the other teams and it</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46200-1
02:57:41.749 --> 02:57:46.157
<v Josh Sparkes>might be more process that's down the
left hand column and what we are doing</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46200-2
02:57:46.157 --> 02:57:49.020
<v Josh Sparkes>that way.
Do you have a process one as well or is</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46200-3
02:57:49.020 --> 02:57:52.340
<v Josh Sparkes>it just per client you see that the
bottom one it's more.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46230-0
02:57:52.380 --> 02:57:57.618
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you just let your team work more,
haven't you, my client,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46230-1
02:57:57.618 --> 02:58:02.300
<v Josh Sparkes>rather than anything.
I suppose onboarding and of course I</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46230-2
02:58:02.300 --> 02:58:07.140
<v Josh Sparkes>don't manage my team,
but I think we can fix them up really.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46272-0
02:58:07.580 --> 02:58:13.443
<v Josh Sparkes>Threshold ones as well, 100,000 plus.
It would still go to the same person.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46272-1
02:58:13.443 --> 02:58:16.992
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's no,
but they just have a priority.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46272-2
02:58:16.992 --> 02:58:22.623
<v Josh Sparkes>Privacy jump assigned to the same,
but they have a. Yeah, perfect. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46272-3
02:58:22.623 --> 02:58:27.020
<v Josh Sparkes>it still as the assigned Ebola is based
on skill levels.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46281-0
02:58:27.100 --> 02:58:30.311
<v Josh Sparkes>Easy up those,
medium and more complex ones and some</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46281-1
02:58:30.311 --> 02:58:35.036
<v Josh Sparkes>more pertain is it with the team. OK,
is there somebody else approaching too?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46281-2
02:58:35.036 --> 02:58:35.460
<v Josh Sparkes>Mm-hmm.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46296-0
02:58:36.860 --> 02:58:40.882
<v Josh Sparkes>Time, time cards.
Did we mention that earlier?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46296-1
02:58:40.882 --> 02:58:43.620
<v Josh Sparkes>We mentioned time cards earlier.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46354-0
02:58:43.980 --> 02:58:46.896
<v Parik Narain>Just one question, Josh,
on the on the portals, sorry,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46302-0
02:58:45.100 --> 02:58:46.380
<v Josh Sparkes>I read them.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46354-1
02:58:46.896 --> 02:58:51.084
<v Parik Narain>just one question on the portals and you
you mentioned these portals are third</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46354-2
02:58:51.084 --> 02:58:54.105
<v Parik Narain>party managed, right?
Are these just for my information,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46354-3
02:58:54.105 --> 02:58:58.240
<v Parik Narain>are these portals managed per per country
by by a third party authority where</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46354-4
02:58:58.240 --> 02:59:02.481
<v Parik Narain>clients have to be there if they opt for
legal services or something like that?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46354-5
02:59:02.481 --> 02:59:03.700
<v Parik Narain>What are these portals?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46363-0
02:59:04.580 --> 02:59:08.940
<v Parik Narain>Do other legal firms use the same portal
as well, just like I trust?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46394-0
02:59:07.340 --> 02:59:11.259
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes. So it'll be, say,
Goldman Sachs is collaborating every time.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46394-1
02:59:11.259 --> 02:59:15.949
<v Josh Sparkes>Every law firm that's engaging with them
will have to upload their invoices to</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46394-2
02:59:15.949 --> 02:59:16.780
<v Josh Sparkes>collaborative.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46395-0
02:59:17.580 --> 02:59:19.060
<v Parik Narain>Got it. Got it. Got it. OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46406-0
02:59:18.700 --> 02:59:22.757
<v Josh Sparkes>Present that to be into their payment
system and they integrate it that way,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46406-1
02:59:22.757 --> 02:59:23.020
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46408-0
02:59:22.860 --> 02:59:24.300
<v Parik Narain>Yes. All right. Makes sense.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46416-0
02:59:25.020 --> 02:59:28.740
<v Josh Sparkes>You mentioned checklist. Is that OK?</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46432-0
02:59:29.580 --> 02:59:33.698
<v Josh Sparkes>Looks like just you have as long as
everything checklist. Oh yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46432-1
02:59:33.698 --> 02:59:34.620
<v Josh Sparkes>that'd be good.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46438-0
02:59:37.580 --> 02:59:45.140
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got all these in tickets,
haven't we on the stickies? Yeah, yeah.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46448-0
02:59:50.700 --> 02:59:53.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Don't know where it is.
I hope it's gonna be in that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46474-0
02:59:54.940 --> 03:00:02.744
<v Josh Sparkes>Is this for your life check stuff? No,
this is for our on boarding.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46474-1
03:00:02.744 --> 03:00:11.466
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a checklist. And as you say,
time keep breaks that standard as they</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46474-2
03:00:11.466 --> 03:00:14.220
<v Josh Sparkes>were formed for that so.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46488-0
03:00:14.260 --> 03:00:21.793
<v Josh Sparkes>Title ID rates, currency.
Is that something that's almost denied,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46488-1
03:00:21.793 --> 03:00:22.820
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46507-0
03:00:24.380 --> 03:00:29.469
<v Josh Sparkes>You'd be better speaking to Rama.
They would have that on there. Oh, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46507-1
03:00:29.469 --> 03:00:33.860
<v Josh Sparkes>They would know like they would have the
the ranks and OK, OK.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46517-0
03:00:38.020 --> 03:00:43.100
<v Josh Sparkes>All right. I think that's everything.
Yeah. Thank you very much for that.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46537-0
03:00:45.740 --> 03:00:53.785
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, few follow up actions there from us.
We'll share notes and outcomes when say</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46537-1
03:00:53.785 --> 03:00:57.260
<v Josh Sparkes>we've got workshops this week, but.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46570-0

some action.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46570-2
03:01:07.080 --> 03:01:11.796
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe we've got some quick wins that will
be back. Yeah,</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46570-3
03:01:11.796 --> 03:01:16.180
<v Josh Sparkes>but I think we're saying that we have
these stories.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46612-0

<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, it sounds November,
but actually it's only around the corner.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46612-2
03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:32.209
<v Josh Sparkes>So we need to clarify the actions out of
this workshop before you create those</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46612-3
03:01:32.209 --> 03:01:35.900

<v Josh Sparkes>I think we're there.
We'll write up all our notes where we're</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46636-2

03:01:47.863 --> 03:01:51.327
<v Josh Sparkes>to do that. We'll turn that round.
We should get to turn up.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46636-4
03:01:51.327 --> 03:01:52.860
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll send normally around.</v>

4fca0af9-5f0b-48c5-aaf5-07c2085b825f/46663-0
