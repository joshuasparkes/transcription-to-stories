4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/54-3
00:07:05.537 --> 00:07:08.399
<v Josh Sparkes>going to be part of this programme and
below that,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/54-4
00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:10.699
<v Josh Sparkes>the technology that underpins this so so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/55-0
00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:14.397
<v Josh Sparkes>Technical bits there,
integrations that we'll get into a bit</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/55-1
00:07:14.397 --> 00:07:16.846
<v Josh Sparkes>later,
but that's the kind of top to bottom of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/55-2
00:07:16.846 --> 00:07:19.243
<v Josh Sparkes>what we're doing and why the very high
level.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/55-3
00:07:19.243 --> 00:07:22.995
<v Josh Sparkes>Hopefully that's a little bit clear.
We'll share all this afterwards if</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/55-4
00:07:22.995 --> 00:07:24.819
<v Josh Sparkes>everyone wants that document, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/56-0
00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:32.324
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
The previous slide that integrated ESM</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/56-1
00:07:32.324 --> 00:07:36.120
<v Josh Sparkes>moments that matter,
so you know those teams which are</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/56-2
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.192
<v Josh Sparkes>mentioned or the functions which are
mentioned is that in,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/56-3
00:07:40.192 --> 00:07:45.299
<v Josh Sparkes>in any sequence of who goes first or is
it just like all the teams there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/57-0
00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:49.379
<v Josh Sparkes>The go live is is going to be the one
it's going to be a Big Bang.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/57-1
00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:52.807
<v Josh Sparkes>We've staggered the design for all of
them together, right? Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/57-2
00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:56.027
<v Josh Sparkes>All those two links going. Yeah.
There's no particular order.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/57-3
00:07:56.027 --> 00:07:58.468
<v Josh Sparkes>It's to kind of almost showcase that
actually,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/57-4
00:07:58.468 --> 00:08:02.311
<v Josh Sparkes>all of these functions are going to be
going live on this digital enabled</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/57-5
00:08:02.311 --> 00:08:02.779
<v Josh Sparkes>platform.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/58-0
00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:06.110
<v Josh Sparkes>What's also important,
and we must forget this,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/58-1
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:10.628
<v Josh Sparkes>this is much bigger of a wider enterprise
sense management. That's good.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/58-2
00:08:10.628 --> 00:08:15.704
<v Josh Sparkes>So because I'm aware IT and ask are like
in the first phase or you know like they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/58-3
00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:19.851
<v Josh Sparkes>they are they have more,
they've had more interactions and P2P and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/58-4
00:08:19.851 --> 00:08:22.699
<v Josh Sparkes>OPS as well is that your next one to pick
up?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/59-0
00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:24.890
<v Josh Sparkes>So that'll be the next phase as yeah.
Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/59-1
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.386
<v Josh Sparkes>As as those teams start to identify those
use cases,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/59-2
00:08:27.386 --> 00:08:29.928
<v Josh Sparkes>actually we need to start being on the
same platform.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/59-3
00:08:29.928 --> 00:08:33.742
<v Josh Sparkes>We need to be able to drive those end to
end journeys in terms of the enterprise</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/59-4
00:08:33.742 --> 00:08:36.425
<v Josh Sparkes>service management.
That's what I need to start to think</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/59-5
00:08:36.425 --> 00:08:39.721
<v Josh Sparkes>about. OK, how do we on board,
how do we get into those services, OK?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/59-6
00:08:39.721 --> 00:08:42.499
<v Josh Sparkes>Because just going back to date two
discussions about P2P.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/60-0
00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:46.966
<v Josh Sparkes>In the procurement projects and also we
might be involved somewhere in that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/60-1
00:08:46.966 --> 00:08:51.354
<v Josh Sparkes>discussion as well like the accounts
people perspective and and most of the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/60-2
00:08:51.354 --> 00:08:54.760
<v Josh Sparkes>teams would be somewhere have to input on
the OPS as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/60-3
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.339
<v Josh Sparkes>Just FYI in case if you need us just give
us a shout because.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/61-0
00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:01.656
<v Josh Sparkes>A lot is down.
A lot is impacted downstream to us as</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/61-1
00:09:01.656 --> 00:09:04.362
<v Josh Sparkes>well. Makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Good point.
Thanks, Andy.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/61-2
00:09:04.362 --> 00:09:06.452
<v Josh Sparkes>Just to kind of add to this as well,
is it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/61-3
00:09:06.452 --> 00:09:09.016
<v Josh Sparkes>you know once we get through this week
and next week,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/61-4
00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:12.768
<v Josh Sparkes>we do need to have an option to kind of
go and it's went what does it start to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/61-5
00:09:12.768 --> 00:09:16.329
<v Josh Sparkes>look like particularly from a finance
perspective and even wider than that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/61-6
00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:18.419
<v Josh Sparkes>across the whole of ask and also
including.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/62-0
00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:21.071
<v Josh Sparkes>To it as well.
So we'll start to plan some of those</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/62-1
00:09:21.071 --> 00:09:23.467
<v Josh Sparkes>sessions.
So we'll start to think about what does</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/62-2
00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:26.007
<v Josh Sparkes>that look like? Yeah,
and I think Deborah discussed,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/62-3
00:09:26.007 --> 00:09:29.697
<v Josh Sparkes>I think maybe I want to spend half an
hour with you tomorrow or maybe today.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/62-4
00:09:29.697 --> 00:09:31.949
<v Josh Sparkes>It depends.
And just to give you that end ring</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/62-5
00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:34.297
<v Josh Sparkes>picture,
because I I thought we're just covering</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/62-6
00:09:34.297 --> 00:09:37.412
<v Josh Sparkes>it and ask in this space.
So that's a good thing to know that if</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/62-7
00:09:37.412 --> 00:09:38.179
<v Josh Sparkes>OPS and P2P are.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/63-0
00:09:38.259 --> 00:09:42.131
<v Josh Sparkes>Forward, we would be involved. So yeah.
So in terms of the support functions,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/63-1
00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:45.805
<v Josh Sparkes>they wouldn't be coming on search now
right now this is the target state.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/63-2
00:09:45.805 --> 00:09:48.834
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah, phase one,
definitely it us within certain function</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/63-3
00:09:48.834 --> 00:09:52.905
<v Josh Sparkes>in there as well parts of the P2P because
we need to include them as part of that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/63-4
00:09:52.905 --> 00:09:55.834
<v Josh Sparkes>journey as well.
Then the rest of the support functions is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/63-5
00:09:55.834 --> 00:09:56.579
<v Josh Sparkes>a future phase.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/64-0
00:09:58.499 --> 00:10:02.481
<v Josh Sparkes>Thanks. Clarification, Julia.
It's just some workshop hygiene as we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/64-1
00:10:02.481 --> 00:10:05.468
<v Josh Sparkes>call it.
So I'm sure you guys are all very polite,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/64-2
00:10:05.468 --> 00:10:09.333
<v Josh Sparkes>but these things just help us stay
present. That's always useful.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/64-3
00:10:09.333 --> 00:10:13.725
<v Josh Sparkes>And one conversation at a time.
I would say that the mics are quite boomy.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/64-4
00:10:13.725 --> 00:10:16.419
<v Josh Sparkes>So you will definitely hear people over
them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/65-0
00:10:17.739 --> 00:10:22.119
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got a break in the middle.
We'll see the agenda in a second order.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/65-1
00:10:22.119 --> 00:10:25.119
<v Josh Sparkes>Went through the agenda,
but we have a big break.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/65-2
00:10:25.119 --> 00:10:29.199
<v Josh Sparkes>Bigger break in the middle,
but we're going to try and get finished</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/65-3
00:10:29.199 --> 00:10:33.219
<v Josh Sparkes>up for the lunchy time. Ish. Yes.
We have a parking lot over here.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/67-0
00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:36.936
<v Josh Sparkes>This is an area where,
if we're deep diving into an area that we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/67-1
00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:39.845
<v Josh Sparkes>don't need to right now,
but it's important for later,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/67-2
00:10:39.845 --> 00:10:43.811
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll record it and put on there quite a
few of those have been coming up.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/67-3
00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:47.619
<v Josh Sparkes>Me and Deb will be writing those up just
to keep us in the time bounds.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/68-0
00:10:48.499 --> 00:10:51.192
<v Josh Sparkes>And what else we got?
Every voice valuable. Yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/68-1
00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:54.985
<v Josh Sparkes>So I would say please speak as much as
you can. The more we're here,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/68-2
00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:58.833
<v Josh Sparkes>the more we can take note and learn.
That's what we need to do today.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/68-3
00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:02.900
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's our objective and moving
towards decisions and priorities. Yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/68-4
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.979
<v Josh Sparkes>So we need to be making decisions as
quickly as we can.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/69-0
00:11:06.819 --> 00:11:11.230
<v Josh Sparkes>That's kind of what we're at the parking
lot as well to keep us moving forward</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/69-1
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.855
<v Josh Sparkes>towards those and we're capturing all
actions.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/69-2
00:11:13.855 --> 00:11:16.815
<v Josh Sparkes>So please do keep your your mind on the
on the goal.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/69-3
00:11:16.815 --> 00:11:21.059
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll be taking actions and parking lot
items so you guys can stay focused.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/70-0
00:11:22.419 --> 00:11:25.766
<v Josh Sparkes>What we've done so far,
so we had some preliminary sessions,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/70-1
00:11:25.766 --> 00:11:29.389
<v Josh Sparkes>there's been a lot of initial discoveries,
some great work there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/70-2
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:33.944
<v Josh Sparkes>I know there's been a review back around
of what those initial processes have been</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/70-3
00:11:33.944 --> 00:11:37.785
<v Josh Sparkes>captured from the MPL today.
We're going to be doing have a deep dive</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/70-4
00:11:37.785 --> 00:11:38.499
<v Josh Sparkes>on discovery.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/72-0
00:11:39.179 --> 00:11:43.242
<v Josh Sparkes>Debra's going to be walking us through
and kind of guiding the conversation,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/72-1
00:11:43.242 --> 00:11:46.724
<v Josh Sparkes>and that's a lot about process
clarification and localization and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/72-2
00:11:46.724 --> 00:11:49.996
<v Josh Sparkes>consolidation as well.
So we'll explain the consolidation and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/72-3
00:11:49.996 --> 00:11:53.003
<v Josh Sparkes>how that works,
but you'll see that in a moment that all</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/72-4
00:11:53.003 --> 00:11:54.059
<v Josh Sparkes>going to leads into.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/74-0
00:11:54.939 --> 00:11:58.727
<v Josh Sparkes>Requirements and user story gathering.
Generally you've been part of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/74-1
00:11:58.727 --> 00:12:02.955
<v Josh Sparkes>implementation programmes before.
Assume yes, so familiar with requirements.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/74-2
00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:07.512
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got to start on those what we have,
but all of this outputs today will lead</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/74-3
00:12:07.512 --> 00:12:11.904
<v Josh Sparkes>into that and we'll share those with you
and you'll be part of the process with</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/74-4
00:12:11.904 --> 00:12:12.179
<v Josh Sparkes>that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/75-0
00:12:13.819 --> 00:12:17.669
<v Josh Sparkes>Prioritising services for enhancements.
Yeah, we get a chance.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/75-1
00:12:17.669 --> 00:12:22.253
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll look at which what we need to
prioritise kind of slightly adjusted a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/75-2
00:12:22.253 --> 00:12:26.899
<v Josh Sparkes>focus from service level priorities to
what kind of horizontal we focus on.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/76-0
00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:32.446
<v Josh Sparkes>And good experience at the top and get
people to use it and then that will all</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/76-1
00:12:32.446 --> 00:12:35.608
<v Josh Sparkes>lead into design,
which students said we're going to look</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/76-2
00:12:35.608 --> 00:12:38.389
<v Josh Sparkes>at across the board,
link and everything together.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/76-3
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:42.696
<v Josh Sparkes>And that of course leading the build.
So we'll look at the broader programming</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/76-4
00:12:42.696 --> 00:12:44.059
<v Josh Sparkes>dates a little bit later.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/77-0
00:12:44.899 --> 00:12:48.474
<v Josh Sparkes>This is what we need to do as a whole
part of the transformation today,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/77-1
00:12:48.474 --> 00:12:52.249
<v Josh Sparkes>really focus on the process clarification.
We will be touching on knowledge</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/77-2
00:12:52.249 --> 00:12:55.874
<v Josh Sparkes>clarifying what we're doing there.
We'll touch an SLA as well and help a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/77-3
00:12:55.874 --> 00:12:58.506
<v Josh Sparkes>little bit on reporting.
Got some suggestions there,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/77-4
00:12:58.506 --> 00:13:02.579
<v Josh Sparkes>but things will come up in conversation
about what kind of reports you guys need.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/78-0
00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:07.731
<v Josh Sparkes>And change as well that the change,
but that's doing very well and we'll be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/78-1
00:13:07.731 --> 00:13:12.100
<v Josh Sparkes>touching on at the end objectives to
fully understanding the core processes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/78-2
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.448
<v Josh Sparkes>That's the main thing today.
Knowing your pain points yet,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/78-3
00:13:15.448 --> 00:13:18.739
<v Josh Sparkes>please do shout out,
we've already captured the sun, but.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/79-0
00:13:19.059 --> 00:13:21.504
<v Josh Sparkes>Comes up in conversation with eight
points.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/79-1
00:13:21.504 --> 00:13:26.060
<v Josh Sparkes>We'd love to address those consolidating.
I'll show you that again in a second to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/79-2
00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.727
<v Josh Sparkes>explain that and capturing, yeah,
requirements to commence. Bill,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/79-3
00:13:29.727 --> 00:13:33.339
<v Josh Sparkes>that's kind of a general app of this and
changing. Thanks again.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/80-0
00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:39.118
<v Josh Sparkes>So what we've done so far to date,
it's been a lot of great work and process</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/80-1
00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:42.754
<v Josh Sparkes>mapping before this stage.
So process decomposition that's putting</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/80-2
00:13:42.754 --> 00:13:46.662
<v Josh Sparkes>it all into a logical spreadsheet
structure that we'll see we work into</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/80-3
00:13:46.662 --> 00:13:49.593
<v Josh Sparkes>towards a functional specification.
How it all works,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/80-4
00:13:49.593 --> 00:13:51.059
<v Josh Sparkes>what it needs to look like.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/81-0
00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:54.883
<v Josh Sparkes>The actual user stories,
as we've talked about and then we move</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/81-1
00:13:54.883 --> 00:13:58.812
<v Josh Sparkes>into actual kind of development phase of
putting things in the backlog in the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/81-2
00:13:58.812 --> 00:14:01.432
<v Josh Sparkes>right priority.
What gets in phase one and then the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/81-3
00:14:01.432 --> 00:14:03.699
<v Josh Sparkes>execution of that.
So we'll cover that part.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/82-0
00:14:05.699 --> 00:14:09.920
<v Josh Sparkes>We talked a bit about assignment groups
in the prelim sessions broadly across</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/82-1
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.950
<v Josh Sparkes>past finance,
and these are what we've captured as kind</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/82-2
00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:14.899
<v Josh Sparkes>of options. We know there's there's.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/83-0
00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:20.519
<v Josh Sparkes>The separation between these scenes just
double check my the memory there,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/83-1
00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:23.695
<v Josh Sparkes>but see that there has been in the the
discovery so far,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/83-2
00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:27.763
<v Josh Sparkes>but we are driving towards a global
approach. So as we go through these,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/83-3
00:14:27.763 --> 00:14:31.219
<v Josh Sparkes>let's see if we can move towards global
when we can familiar.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/84-0
00:14:32.259 --> 00:14:33.846
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
And then there's kind of role based</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/84-1
00:14:33.846 --> 00:14:36.379
<v Josh Sparkes>things as well. So within each team,
you can have different roles.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/86-0
00:14:38.139 --> 00:14:42.567
<v Josh Sparkes>Pain points that we discovered early on.
These probably feed into our principles</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/86-1
00:14:42.567 --> 00:14:46.721
<v Josh Sparkes>and our design principles as well.
We want to try and solve these few guys,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/86-2
00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:49.673
<v Josh Sparkes>but as I said,
we'll we'll capture as many as we can,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/86-3
00:14:49.673 --> 00:14:53.992
<v Josh Sparkes>but these kind of stay top of mind when
we're designing and thinking about the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/86-4
00:14:53.992 --> 00:14:54.539
<v Josh Sparkes>programme.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/88-0
00:14:55.859 --> 00:14:58.564
<v Josh Sparkes>I am trying to get us to the to the bulk
of the work,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/87-0
00:14:55.899 --> 00:14:56.019
<v Parik>OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/88-1
00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:01.420
<v Josh Sparkes>but consolidation is a an important thing
to understand.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/88-2
00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.278
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll show that in a second everybody
want to talk to what we're considering</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/88-3
00:15:05.278 --> 00:15:05.579
<v Josh Sparkes>today.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/89-0
00:15:12.339 --> 00:15:16.154
<v Josh Sparkes>As I say, we really want to look at them.
Some rolling offers of service</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/89-1
00:15:16.154 --> 00:15:19.603
<v Josh Sparkes>recommendation service and and you know
what's your entry points,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/89-2
00:15:19.603 --> 00:15:22.164
<v Josh Sparkes>how do they get to you?
How do they get queries,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/89-3
00:15:22.164 --> 00:15:25.352
<v Josh Sparkes>what they come to you?
Pain points can be fixed in upstream.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/89-4
00:15:25.352 --> 00:15:26.659
<v Josh Sparkes>So lots of conversations.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/90-0
00:15:27.859 --> 00:15:31.258
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's how we're going through it.
So the challenges,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/90-1
00:15:31.258 --> 00:15:34.951
<v Josh Sparkes>obviously what that positive disruption,
can it be globalised?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/90-2
00:15:34.951 --> 00:15:39.582
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there a separation of duties you need
to separately in Australia or is it a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/90-3
00:15:39.582 --> 00:15:43.099
<v Josh Sparkes>process with some localization nuances?
And I think that's.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/91-0
00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:48.145
<v Josh Sparkes>All that quite well this week when we
challenge that and then challenge us back</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/91-1
00:15:48.145 --> 00:15:52.256
<v Josh Sparkes>as well, so open discussion,
you know that's what we want, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/91-2
00:15:52.256 --> 00:15:54.699
<v Josh Sparkes>to get to the landing at the right place.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/92-0
00:15:57.459 --> 00:16:00.325
<v Josh Sparkes>And again, look,
we're not going to go through this.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/92-1
00:16:00.325 --> 00:16:03.300
<v Josh Sparkes>Check this one by one.
The reasons that are within the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/92-2
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.815
<v Josh Sparkes>discussions, you know what trick is it,
who's depending upon it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/92-3
00:16:06.815 --> 00:16:10.168
<v Josh Sparkes>who else depend upon it,
what's the impact upstream actually,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/92-4
00:16:10.168 --> 00:16:13.900
<v Josh Sparkes>is it mounted somewhere else and
therefore we don't need to hold it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/92-5
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.739
<v Josh Sparkes>but all that type of conversation.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/93-0
00:16:16.579 --> 00:16:19.357
<v Josh Sparkes>And you know,
as we've seen throughout this week,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/93-1
00:16:19.357 --> 00:16:22.079
<v Josh Sparkes>that sort of failure,
not the same failure rate,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/93-2
00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:26.580
<v Josh Sparkes>but why does those errors or changes or
amendments come to you in the 1st place?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/93-3
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.858
<v Josh Sparkes>And could that be corrected on some of
the insights that you're capturing in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/93-4
00:16:30.858 --> 00:16:34.081
<v Josh Sparkes>your ServiceNow queries?
So it's sort of these, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/93-5
00:16:34.081 --> 00:16:34.859
<v Josh Sparkes>complete loop?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/94-0
00:16:35.459 --> 00:16:39.455
<v Josh Sparkes>Of OK go through the process,
get some good calls,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/94-1
00:16:39.455 --> 00:16:45.333
<v Josh Sparkes>correct it upstream and then eventually
get some hopefully utopia moments.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/94-2
00:16:45.333 --> 00:16:51.915
<v Josh Sparkes>That's client matter rates and time card.
It's appreciating that that's the science</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/94-3
00:16:51.915 --> 00:16:52.699
<v Josh Sparkes>in itself.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/95-0
00:16:53.419 --> 00:16:57.537
<v Josh Sparkes>So as we go through today,
it's simplified but not trivialised.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/95-1
00:16:57.537 --> 00:17:00.947
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's the message that we've had
this week.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/95-2
00:17:00.947 --> 00:17:04.100
<v Josh Sparkes>Appreciate that there's lots of detail
involved,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/95-3
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:09.313
<v Josh Sparkes>but this is capturing the task to manage
it rather than adding an extra layer of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/95-4
00:17:09.313 --> 00:17:12.659
<v Josh Sparkes>admin that would might take quicker to do
the task.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/96-0
00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:14.939
<v Josh Sparkes>Good in the afternoon.
So it's that fine balance.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/97-0
00:17:17.059 --> 00:17:22.007
<v Josh Sparkes>That leads into the accommodation piece.
So we really understand it when we get</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/97-1
00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:25.842
<v Josh Sparkes>into it and you see the NPL kind of
consolidated in services.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/97-2
00:17:25.842 --> 00:17:30.543
<v Josh Sparkes>Deborah mentioned generally though in the
top right, fewer catalogue items,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/97-3
00:17:30.543 --> 00:17:34.131
<v Josh Sparkes>better news or experience of course,
diminishing returns.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/97-4
00:17:34.131 --> 00:17:35.739
<v Josh Sparkes>If you go down to too few.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/98-0
00:17:35.979 --> 00:17:40.048
<v Josh Sparkes>But we have consolidated quite quite
thoroughly. Some FAQ is about it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/98-1
00:17:40.048 --> 00:17:44.061
<v Josh Sparkes>The one that normally comes up is.
Are we losing any functionality by</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/98-2
00:17:44.061 --> 00:17:47.385
<v Josh Sparkes>consolidating items?
The answer is that will capabilities</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/98-3
00:17:47.385 --> 00:17:51.226
<v Josh Sparkes>remain. So you'll see it in action.
It will make a bit more sense.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/98-4
00:17:51.226 --> 00:17:52.659
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not fully clear now.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/99-0
00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:57.139
<v Josh Sparkes>But this is our method for consolidating
for a better experience for everyone.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/100-0
00:17:59.459 --> 00:18:02.898
<v Josh Sparkes>Just just an example really.
So what we're looking at today,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/100-1
00:18:02.898 --> 00:18:07.238
<v Josh Sparkes>some of these processes that be familiar
with will feed into this consultant</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/100-2
00:18:07.238 --> 00:18:09.099
<v Josh Sparkes>service that makes logical sense.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/101-0
00:18:10.499 --> 00:18:15.324
<v Josh Sparkes>We've been working through this workshop
workbook tongue Twister at the top and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/101-1
00:18:15.324 --> 00:18:20.088
<v Josh Sparkes>that just kind of keeps us on track with
making sure everything's addressed so</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/101-2
00:18:20.088 --> 00:18:24.913
<v Josh Sparkes>that you can see how we've consolidated.
We've captured your responses and your</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/101-3
00:18:24.913 --> 00:18:25.939
<v Josh Sparkes>preliminary work.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/102-0
00:18:26.819 --> 00:18:29.120
<v Josh Sparkes>So this is how we're gonna make sure
we're moving through,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/102-1
00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.939
<v Josh Sparkes>not missing anything.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/103-0
00:18:31.539 --> 00:18:34.608
<v Josh Sparkes>All right.
And we can we can get into it to be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/103-1
00:18:34.608 --> 00:18:37.939
<v Josh Sparkes>honest, where we at 921? OK. Perfect.
Yeah, right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/104-0
00:18:41.139 --> 00:18:48.841
<v Josh Sparkes>If I jump over to,
I don't want you to know about the Excel</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/104-1
00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:55.259
<v Josh Sparkes>1 by 150 in the you've seen in the
processes and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/105-0
00:18:56.179 --> 00:19:00.287
<v Josh Sparkes>We combine them as you can see,
drop down maybe on the team Qi</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/105-1
00:19:00.287 --> 00:19:03.352
<v Josh Sparkes>recommendation.
We've got these four sections.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/105-2
00:19:03.352 --> 00:19:06.743
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm hoping that aligns or lands well with
yourself.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/105-3
00:19:06.743 --> 00:19:11.699
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe we can manage things on an order.
Clients matter rates and then time.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/106-0
00:19:12.019 --> 00:19:16.710
<v Josh Sparkes>That seemed to be a logical step for
myself, if that's all right. Yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/106-1
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:20.938
<v Josh Sparkes>absolutely. And again,
there's probably outside of service now,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/106-2
00:19:20.938 --> 00:19:25.959
<v Josh Sparkes>there's this whole cycle that's gets
created, agreed, signed off, etcetera.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/106-3
00:19:25.959 --> 00:19:29.659
<v Josh Sparkes>So it is the ability to handle those
queries that come.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/107-0
00:19:30.059 --> 00:19:33.548
<v Josh Sparkes>Means that,
so that's probably like all the other</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/107-1
00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:38.782
<v Josh Sparkes>sort of functions that we've done.
There's lots of activities outside it's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/107-2
00:19:38.782 --> 00:19:42.480
<v Josh Sparkes>masking free,
which actually bond resulting with the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/107-3
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.179
<v Josh Sparkes>managed clients they,
I mean that you currently get.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/108-0
00:19:46.659 --> 00:19:54.575
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry, can I ask the question? Yeah.
And so they 4 categories, sorry,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/108-1
00:19:54.575 --> 00:20:01.699
<v Josh Sparkes>they 4 categories. They are managed by oh,
sorry. Yeah, green.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/109-0
00:20:06.099 --> 00:20:08.427
<v Josh Sparkes>That better? Yeah.
So these four categories,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/109-1
00:20:08.427 --> 00:20:11.738
<v Josh Sparkes>is that what the user,
the person who wants the request is that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/109-2
00:20:11.738 --> 00:20:15.617
<v Josh Sparkes>how do they urgently see it? Yeah.
I mean that the services that they will</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/109-3
00:20:15.617 --> 00:20:20.066
<v Josh Sparkes>get. So it could be that they want to say,
for example, when they're buying the grid,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/109-4
00:20:20.066 --> 00:20:22.446
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, entering it. Yeah,
the entry point,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/109-5
00:20:22.446 --> 00:20:24.619
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be that they might not know that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/110-0
00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:27.538
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, managed by that county. Yeah,
it could be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/110-1
00:20:27.538 --> 00:20:31.808
<v Josh Sparkes>I want to do the following and that's the
and that's the task or the form that we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/110-2
00:20:31.808 --> 00:20:34.515
<v Josh Sparkes>presented to them.
You should put them in services.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/110-3
00:20:34.515 --> 00:20:38.316
<v Josh Sparkes>They might just as you said it wouldn't
land if they wouldn't know that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/110-4
00:20:38.316 --> 00:20:40.763
<v Josh Sparkes>That's right.
That's so it's just the service,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/110-5
00:20:40.763 --> 00:20:43.939
<v Josh Sparkes>but effectively how it lands with them
that we I want to do.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/112-0
00:20:44.299 --> 00:20:48.981
<v Josh Sparkes>Right through the portal. You know,
maybe in three clicks that that's the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/112-1
00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:53.790
<v Josh Sparkes>service that they manage. OK, yeah,
rather than than what's managed client.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/112-2
00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:57.840
<v Josh Sparkes>So that group is on again,
you can be for all sorts of reasons,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/112-3
00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.979
<v Josh Sparkes>but this would be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/113-0
00:20:59.379 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Josh Sparkes>We look for a while.
We're here for this particular things.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/113-1
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.226
<v Josh Sparkes>You know how they're doing it.
So their funding would be,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/113-2
00:21:06.226 --> 00:21:09.591
<v Josh Sparkes>I want to do the following,
which you probably, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/113-3
00:21:09.591 --> 00:21:14.059
<v Josh Sparkes>relates to the rates. That's it. OK.
It would be kind matter, but they said.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/114-0
00:21:15.539 --> 00:21:20.101
<v Josh Sparkes>So these are the things.
Can I just check and is it beneficial if</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/114-1
00:21:20.101 --> 00:21:25.424
<v Josh Sparkes>like yesterday we give an overview of
assuring like a very brief way to make</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/114-2
00:21:25.424 --> 00:21:29.779
<v Josh Sparkes>sure that everybody understands what
rates mean over here and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/115-0
00:21:30.019 --> 00:21:35.264
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. And like the end process of rates,
what we manage is it possible for you to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/115-1
00:21:35.264 --> 00:21:38.655
<v Josh Sparkes>give an overview,
start out doing dark myself in the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/115-2
00:21:38.655 --> 00:21:42.301
<v Josh Sparkes>journey? I don't probably use opia.
What is our process?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/115-3
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:47.163
<v Josh Sparkes>What does rates mean actually? Yeah,
not not going into any technicalities.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/115-4
00:21:47.163 --> 00:21:47.739
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/116-0
00:21:48.259 --> 00:21:52.980
<v Josh Sparkes>The rates team are probably going to
entertain that they do also the global</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/116-1
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:58.198
<v Josh Sparkes>and change rates or they put no rates in,
that's the majority of their job and then</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/116-2
00:21:58.198 --> 00:22:02.422
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll talk about the matter.
There's a lot of updating of addresses</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/116-3
00:22:02.422 --> 00:22:04.659
<v Josh Sparkes>and 3rd party payers and currencies.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/117-0
00:22:06.979 --> 00:22:11.424
<v Josh Sparkes>All that sort of stuff, really.
Panel agreements is a big thing as well,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/117-1
00:22:11.424 --> 00:22:14.774
<v Josh Sparkes>which we do.
So we need to make sure they're in system</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/117-2
00:22:14.774 --> 00:22:19.037
<v Josh Sparkes>as well. That's it, really.
It's all amendments and updating of reads</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/117-3
00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:20.499
<v Josh Sparkes>and anything to do with.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/118-0
00:22:21.859 --> 00:22:26.469
<v Josh Sparkes>The address these affairs currencies,
I just wanted to check it and do you have</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/118-1
00:22:26.469 --> 00:22:30.791
<v Josh Sparkes>like a global standard rate that's
applied for all client matters and then</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/118-2
00:22:30.791 --> 00:22:34.940
<v Josh Sparkes>you may have a potential client that you
have agreed within a contract,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/118-3
00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:39.261
<v Josh Sparkes>a particular rate that you don't have to
update within the system as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/118-4
00:22:39.261 --> 00:22:40.299
<v Josh Sparkes>And then there is?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/119-0
00:22:41.299 --> 00:22:43.713
<v Josh Sparkes>There's global international standard
rates,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/119-1
00:22:43.713 --> 00:22:47.792
<v Josh Sparkes>also global local rates and there's
premium rates. However, on top of that,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/119-2
00:22:47.792 --> 00:22:51.924
<v Josh Sparkes>there's also rates that the partner has
agreed. No, she has tax rates, yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/119-3
00:22:51.924 --> 00:22:55.841
<v Josh Sparkes>it's it's like an onion, many layers.
It's not even just a client level.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/119-4
00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:58.846
<v Josh Sparkes>And within a client that also might be
certain matters,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/119-5
00:22:58.846 --> 00:23:00.939
<v Josh Sparkes>what they're working on that also have.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/120-0
00:23:01.499 --> 00:23:04.926
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we cover annual rates,
discounted rates, volume,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/120-1
00:23:04.926 --> 00:23:09.437
<v Josh Sparkes>discounted rates, multiple things.
So showing there's going to be that the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/120-2
00:23:09.437 --> 00:23:13.766
<v Josh Sparkes>whole layer of the kind of different
rates and it goes down further and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/120-3
00:23:13.766 --> 00:23:17.074
<v Josh Sparkes>further. But yeah,
and this and this can be 95% of our</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/120-4
00:23:17.074 --> 00:23:19.299
<v Josh Sparkes>audience, they may have registration.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/121-0
00:23:20.739 --> 00:23:20.939
<v Josh Sparkes>Should.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/122-0
00:23:21.259 --> 00:23:24.549
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we'll get nominations. Yeah,
that's not typical sense. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/122-1
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:27.133
<v Josh Sparkes>you had some level of sorts of value of
the contracts,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/122-2
00:23:27.133 --> 00:23:30.940
<v Josh Sparkes>and that means that you can get a bulk
discount on ticket rates. Well, yeah. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/122-3
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:34.794
<v Josh Sparkes>So how I was saying yesterday is that all
these documentations and the discussion</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/122-4
00:23:34.794 --> 00:23:37.943
<v Josh Sparkes>was etcetera is agreed at the time of the
induction of the client.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/122-5
00:23:37.943 --> 00:23:41.139
<v Josh Sparkes>So you go through with your standard
rates but then bigger clients.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/123-0
00:23:41.219 --> 00:23:44.937
<v Josh Sparkes>To come and say that no,
we do have these panel agreements and you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/123-1
00:23:44.937 --> 00:23:49.432
<v Josh Sparkes>know for one year it will be XYZ and on
the second year it will be such a search</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/123-2
00:23:49.432 --> 00:23:54.037
<v Josh Sparkes>they will have contract informations that
if we build say 10 million then anything</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/123-3
00:23:54.037 --> 00:23:57.922
<v Josh Sparkes>about 10 million you will give us a 5%
discount anything over 25,000,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/123-4
00:23:57.922 --> 00:23:58.699
<v Josh Sparkes>000 give us a.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/124-0
00:23:59.539 --> 00:24:02.672
<v Josh Sparkes>10% discount.
So all those things are again part of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/124-1
00:24:02.672 --> 00:24:07.735
<v Josh Sparkes>those documentations which is again saved
in the in tough terms as well as in in in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/124-2
00:24:07.735 --> 00:24:08.699
<v Josh Sparkes>that app and so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/125-0
00:24:10.139 --> 00:24:13.736
<v Josh Sparkes>High level is that yes,
the rates are agreed given that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/125-1
00:24:13.736 --> 00:24:18.168
<v Josh Sparkes>information is given to us and
Geraldine's team is gonna be ensuring</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/125-2
00:24:18.168 --> 00:24:22.408
<v Josh Sparkes>that those rates are captured,
which facilitates the next step of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/125-3
00:24:22.408 --> 00:24:26.648
<v Josh Sparkes>billing. Yeah. Yeah. So.
So the bill which we will cover tomorrow</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/125-4
00:24:26.648 --> 00:24:27.419
<v Josh Sparkes>is like PDF.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/126-0
00:24:27.979 --> 00:24:32.294
<v Josh Sparkes>Version of you know PDFPDF bill is
generated at the back of the rates and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/126-1
00:24:32.294 --> 00:24:36.901
<v Josh Sparkes>everything is mentioned in caches, input,
the disbursements, etcetera as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/126-2
00:24:36.901 --> 00:24:40.166
<v Josh Sparkes>So once that is ready either it is sent
back to the PE,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/126-3
00:24:40.166 --> 00:24:44.890
<v Josh Sparkes>if it is a manual billing need to be sent
out by an e-mail to the client or they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/126-4
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.339
<v Josh Sparkes>send that Bill PDF to E billing to upload.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/127-0
00:24:47.499 --> 00:24:49.818
<v Josh Sparkes>On the tracker,
so just giving you a full circle. Yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/127-1
00:24:49.818 --> 00:24:50.619
<v Josh Sparkes>that's great. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/128-0
00:24:52.219 --> 00:24:58.408
<v Josh Sparkes>That's perfect. And I think that's openly,
that's the science outside of these</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/128-1
00:24:58.408 --> 00:25:04.833
<v Josh Sparkes>queries that you're managing and lots of
it up on. So there's a few. What's that?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/128-2
00:25:04.833 --> 00:25:07.419
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there anything on that manage?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/129-0
00:25:07.779 --> 00:25:10.874
<v Josh Sparkes>Clients,
that's I think and probably there's some</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/129-1
00:25:10.874 --> 00:25:13.783
<v Josh Sparkes>duplicate that they might be to do with
rates.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/129-2
00:25:13.783 --> 00:25:18.055
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's other particular queries that
you get in at client level.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/129-3
00:25:18.055 --> 00:25:21.274
<v Josh Sparkes>So address change,
I think there's some of the best</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/129-4
00:25:21.274 --> 00:25:23.379
<v Josh Sparkes>maintenance parent client updates.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/130-0
00:25:24.099 --> 00:25:27.128
<v Josh Sparkes>With notification updates, new pay,
you know the new,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/130-1
00:25:27.128 --> 00:25:28.979
<v Josh Sparkes>so maybe we can start with a new.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/131-0
00:25:30.459 --> 00:25:36.187
<v Josh Sparkes>So is that sort of a good place to start
that you might get a new clients or a new</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/131-1
00:25:36.187 --> 00:25:41.363
<v Josh Sparkes>rates as that or is it yes you get
relationship is yeah we can do so there</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/131-2
00:25:41.363 --> 00:25:45.296
<v Josh Sparkes>is a new client,
there's partners and we negotiate rates</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/131-3
00:25:45.296 --> 00:25:46.539
<v Josh Sparkes>and willing to do.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/132-0
00:25:47.619 --> 00:25:51.841
<v Josh Sparkes>And then come play.
It gets us meaning or by someone else.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/132-1
00:25:51.841 --> 00:25:57.780
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's that's something important was
the momentous and how we get that we do.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/132-2
00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:03.219
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes we get the engagement letter
and sometimes we just get an e-mail.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/133-0
00:26:04.139 --> 00:26:11.099
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes it's just more information that
we get, so it's not, it's not great.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/133-1
00:26:11.099 --> 00:26:17.884
<v Josh Sparkes>How do you see that on top of that?
There's also client needs that often get</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/133-2
00:26:17.884 --> 00:26:23.259
<v Josh Sparkes>to discount as well.
So also I'm just aware that yes, sorry.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/134-0
00:26:23.939 --> 00:26:29.087
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll get a new new agreement through
all advisors of rates and when they do</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/134-1
00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:32.433
<v Josh Sparkes>advisors,
they don't always advise us of everything</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/134-2
00:26:32.433 --> 00:26:36.358
<v Josh Sparkes>that we actually need.
So they may say a partner is actually</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/134-3
00:26:36.358 --> 00:26:40.476
<v Josh Sparkes>such and such such. However,
we've also got premium for the tax</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/134-4
00:26:40.476 --> 00:26:43.179
<v Josh Sparkes>department, they may have different rates.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/135-0
00:26:43.219 --> 00:26:45.864
<v Josh Sparkes>And they don't tell us and they not tell
us that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/135-1
00:26:45.864 --> 00:26:49.833
<v Josh Sparkes>And so there's areas that miss out.
There may be a volume discount what we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/135-2
00:26:49.833 --> 00:26:54.013
<v Josh Sparkes>just discussed and they may forget to
tell us that as well. But on that point,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/135-3
00:26:54.013 --> 00:26:56.605
<v Josh Sparkes>just with the news. So it might be,
as you said,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/135-4
00:26:56.605 --> 00:26:59.939
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a part that going off,
brand new personal new clients.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/136-0
00:27:00.299 --> 00:27:03.852
<v Josh Sparkes>Going off to negotiate, you won't end,
the acquaintance says.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/136-1
00:27:03.852 --> 00:27:06.718
<v Josh Sparkes>You need to set up this client.
So is that yours?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/136-2
00:27:06.718 --> 00:27:11.303
<v Josh Sparkes>But but are you setting up as a client
first, or do you need? Is it a separate?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/136-3
00:27:11.303 --> 00:27:15.659
<v Josh Sparkes>That's just setting it up a client.
Maybe in three-year we go off and then.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/137-0
00:27:16.699 --> 00:27:21.490
<v Josh Sparkes>There's other activity that you know you
do later for rates or sort of growing the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/137-1
00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.819
<v Josh Sparkes>story do are you setting up the new
client associated with matter and then</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/137-2
00:27:25.819 --> 00:27:28.821
<v Josh Sparkes>rates, OK.
Some of your activity might be the query</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/137-3
00:27:28.821 --> 00:27:33.150
<v Josh Sparkes>that you have to set up the client first.
It's one of your, so you've got.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/137-4
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.979
<v Josh Sparkes>Let's see if you've got a client and the
client.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/138-0
00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:40.506
<v Josh Sparkes>The number is 123.
There may be no matters at that point in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/138-1
00:27:40.506 --> 00:27:43.841
<v Josh Sparkes>time,
but when when the partner vendors work</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/138-2
00:27:43.841 --> 00:27:48.807
<v Josh Sparkes>under that client number,
then that's when a matter will be opened</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/138-3
00:27:48.807 --> 00:27:51.179
<v Josh Sparkes>and it'll be matter number 8123.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/139-0
00:27:51.579 --> 00:27:56.830
<v Josh Sparkes>Under client number 123 is to be most
linked to that and so that you could get</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/139-1
00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:01.683
<v Josh Sparkes>that as stages. So you can. OK.
So I think that's probably what this bit</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/139-2
00:28:01.683 --> 00:28:06.071
<v Josh Sparkes>was managing that client.
So you could get the request, yes, yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/139-3
00:28:06.071 --> 00:28:10.259
<v Josh Sparkes>we're promoting now that they come
through now path into your.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/140-0
00:28:11.299 --> 00:28:14.112
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
And then it will be this new clients, yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/140-1
00:28:14.112 --> 00:28:16.868
<v Josh Sparkes>And you understand the check box that you
need,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/140-2
00:28:16.868 --> 00:28:21.519
<v Josh Sparkes>you know instead of this e-mail that you
get that's we need this new client from</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/140-3
00:28:21.519 --> 00:28:25.596
<v Josh Sparkes>yesterday, the following result,
but it could be that we constructed a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/140-4
00:28:25.596 --> 00:28:29.902
<v Josh Sparkes>form that is the name you know the
mandatory things that you need in order</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/140-5
00:28:29.902 --> 00:28:30.419
<v Josh Sparkes>to do it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/141-0
00:28:30.939 --> 00:28:34.150
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So I'm going to actually just take it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/141-1
00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:38.163
<v Josh Sparkes>back there.
So the new client is set up by compliance,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/141-2
00:28:38.163 --> 00:28:41.958
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, right.
So we don't actually set up a new client</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/141-3
00:28:41.958 --> 00:28:47.139
<v Josh Sparkes>and we don't actually do any cheques for
a new client, but we need to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/142-0
00:28:47.819 --> 00:28:50.413
<v Josh Sparkes>And we will add rates and they're asked
to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/142-1
00:28:50.413 --> 00:28:54.834
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're actually setting up all the
client in regards to compliance and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/142-2
00:28:54.834 --> 00:28:58.490
<v Josh Sparkes>cheques and everything.
We we don't do any cheques, OK, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/142-3
00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:02.145
<v Josh Sparkes>So we don't do that.
We only at that point adding we only add</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/142-4
00:29:02.145 --> 00:29:02.499
<v Josh Sparkes>rates.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/143-0
00:29:02.779 --> 00:29:07.633
<v Josh Sparkes>Or we may add who the peer is or which is
almost the same as the matter,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/143-1
00:29:07.633 --> 00:29:11.290
<v Josh Sparkes>or we may add the the billing address
stuff like that,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/143-2
00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:16.144
<v Josh Sparkes>or we may be asked to do that,
but the setting up over is all to do with</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/143-3
00:29:16.144 --> 00:29:18.339
<v Josh Sparkes>compliance and conflicts we only.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/144-0
00:29:18.859 --> 00:29:22.478
<v Josh Sparkes>Amends seating. Self required.
So you're only amending OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/144-1
00:29:22.478 --> 00:29:27.325
<v Josh Sparkes>so is that is that sort of right place
that billing address and you're sort of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/144-2
00:29:27.325 --> 00:29:29.779
<v Josh Sparkes>challenging that you know the PS on the?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/145-0
00:29:31.219 --> 00:29:34.980
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just changing why compliance go to
the address chain, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/145-1
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.078
<v Josh Sparkes>as their service. It should be done.
It should be done.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/145-2
00:29:38.078 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Josh Sparkes>But then that later date there may be a
change. So that's when we do.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/145-3
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:46.485
<v Josh Sparkes>So we don't actually set up the client.
The only thing we would set up within the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/145-4
00:29:46.485 --> 00:29:47.979
<v Josh Sparkes>client is adding the rates.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/146-0
00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:54.132
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. That's. Yeah, we would do that.
Or at the point of you getting the rates,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/146-1
00:29:54.132 --> 00:29:59.009
<v Josh Sparkes>you see that there's a address change
need or whatever it might be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/146-2
00:29:59.009 --> 00:30:04.459
<v Josh Sparkes>So the queries that you may get is I
think I've seen your process is sorry.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/147-0
00:30:05.539 --> 00:30:09.654
<v Josh Sparkes>With that address and some of those
details associated with that clients that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/147-1
00:30:09.654 --> 00:30:12.133
<v Josh Sparkes>that's usually the maximum facility
spectacle.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/147-2
00:30:12.133 --> 00:30:15.193
<v Josh Sparkes>And if you've got the client that you got
a client level,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/147-3
00:30:15.193 --> 00:30:19.307
<v Josh Sparkes>generally the team are dealing with the
matter which is linked to the client.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/147-4
00:30:19.307 --> 00:30:23.475
<v Josh Sparkes>They'll change addresses for for client,
but the majority of our work is to do</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/147-5
00:30:23.475 --> 00:30:23.739
<v Josh Sparkes>with.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/148-0
00:30:24.259 --> 00:30:27.163
<v Josh Sparkes>And the matter? Yeah.
So I'm even wondering. I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/148-1
00:30:27.163 --> 00:30:31.710
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm sort of wondering all these processes
whether there was even a managed clients</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/148-2
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:34.121
<v Josh Sparkes>process, because they're all to do.
I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/148-3
00:30:34.121 --> 00:30:38.175
<v Josh Sparkes>as you see the next ones that come
through also you do breaks the matter.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/148-4
00:30:38.175 --> 00:30:40.586
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So I'm even wondering whether we even</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/148-5
00:30:40.586 --> 00:30:43.819
<v Josh Sparkes>face a new conversation with this
compliance and doing it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/149-0
00:30:44.179 --> 00:30:49.117
<v Josh Sparkes>Whether the queries of changes based on
client level even come to someone?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/149-1
00:30:49.117 --> 00:30:54.318
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean if I just click through soon the
first one is what the notification and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/149-2
00:30:54.318 --> 00:30:59.059
<v Josh Sparkes>that's probably massimated I should
probably change that to the matter.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/151-0
00:30:59.739 --> 00:31:03.845
<v Josh Sparkes>Right launch clients, right?
Not necessarily.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/151-1
00:31:03.845 --> 00:31:10.720
<v Josh Sparkes>So what notification basically is when
they hit a selling and billing point,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/151-2
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:16.165
<v Josh Sparkes>so they've reached so then we have a
budget for that client.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/151-3
00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:18.219
<v Josh Sparkes>So the budget might be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/152-0
00:31:18.379 --> 00:31:22.445
<v Josh Sparkes>A million so,
and it might be that we want to know at</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/152-1
00:31:22.445 --> 00:31:26.887
<v Josh Sparkes>the 800,000 point.
So when that starts hitting the partner</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/152-2
00:31:26.887 --> 00:31:32.534
<v Josh Sparkes>or whether it's on the client will then
start receiving notifications that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/152-3
00:31:32.534 --> 00:31:35.019
<v Josh Sparkes>they're getting the other budget.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/153-0
00:31:35.379 --> 00:31:40.487
<v Josh Sparkes>So that should be client or matter before
and that probably from whip next week is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/153-1
00:31:40.487 --> 00:31:44.119
<v Josh Sparkes>the trigger that maybe then that needs to
come in as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/153-2
00:31:44.119 --> 00:31:48.982
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think we're doing a whip and credit
control next week is that the trigger</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/153-3
00:31:48.982 --> 00:31:50.459
<v Josh Sparkes>that they're monitoring?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/154-0
00:31:50.939 --> 00:31:55.504
<v Josh Sparkes>That matter being all those that are now
being hits, they they would monitor,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/154-1
00:31:55.504 --> 00:31:59.250
<v Josh Sparkes>but I just wanted to check who triggers a
notification, not us.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/154-2
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:02.352
<v Josh Sparkes>So that should be very. Yeah, yeah. No,
no, we will.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/154-3
00:32:02.352 --> 00:32:06.625
<v Josh Sparkes>If somebody wants a notification,
we can add that into the matter. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/154-4
00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:06.859
<v Josh Sparkes>And.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/155-0
00:32:07.099 --> 00:32:10.641
<v Josh Sparkes>It seems more administrative part you are
doing,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/155-1
00:32:10.641 --> 00:32:16.281
<v Josh Sparkes>but the actual calculation of the way
it's the 100 and a million that will be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/155-2
00:32:16.281 --> 00:32:20.764
<v Josh Sparkes>done by the web team and that's in
impacts or where where is,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/155-3
00:32:20.764 --> 00:32:22.499
<v Josh Sparkes>it's in speeding really.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/156-0
00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:26.853
<v Josh Sparkes>You're saying that it's at that point the
notification was triggered.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/156-1
00:32:26.853 --> 00:32:31.204
<v Josh Sparkes>That's being we can add a notification of
the notification that's outside of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/156-2
00:32:31.204 --> 00:32:33.690
<v Josh Sparkes>service now. This is that.
That's in three,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/156-3
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:38.379
<v Josh Sparkes>but it is a we may get a request to stop
the notification, OK or add notification.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/157-0
00:32:39.619 --> 00:32:44.914
<v Josh Sparkes>You get those requests or you're creating
those requests. We get their requests.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/157-1
00:32:44.914 --> 00:32:50.339
<v Josh Sparkes>Usually the PE is on behalf of the. Yeah.
So if there's it's generally on a matter</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/157-2
00:32:50.339 --> 00:32:53.738
<v Josh Sparkes>to be fair,
where there is a budget has been set up</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/157-3
00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:58.249
<v Josh Sparkes>and then we've got notifications and
generally they're fed up with a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/157-4
00:32:58.249 --> 00:32:59.099
<v Josh Sparkes>notification.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/158-0
00:32:59.139 --> 00:33:06.348
<v Josh Sparkes>And then he asked us to take them off.
Yeah, but then what? Because because then?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/158-1
00:33:06.348 --> 00:33:11.974
<v Josh Sparkes>Monitoring it? Yes, yes.
Until they need that notification will</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/158-2
00:33:11.974 --> 00:33:15.579
<v Josh Sparkes>bind up. What? They're not monitoring it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/159-0
00:33:17.659 --> 00:33:20.585
<v Josh Sparkes>So that loop notification is a query into
you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/159-1
00:33:20.585 --> 00:33:24.196
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just asking you a question on that.
Sorry, Geraldine,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/159-2
00:33:24.196 --> 00:33:27.870
<v Josh Sparkes>and that's notifications at client label
and matter label,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/159-3
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.859
<v Josh Sparkes>you might be asked to switch on and off,
right?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/160-0
00:33:34.299 --> 00:33:35.659
<v Josh Sparkes>The claim is that you get all that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/161-0
00:33:37.699 --> 00:33:41.600
<v Josh Sparkes>Or turning on, yes,
it would be any other people that may</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/161-1
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.031
<v Josh Sparkes>trigger them.
So it could be maybe it could be the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/161-2
00:33:45.031 --> 00:33:48.394
<v Josh Sparkes>partner,
but generally leading with PPE generally</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/161-3
00:33:48.394 --> 00:33:52.699
<v Josh Sparkes>or would need yeah for this one probably
just P music partners.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/162-0
00:33:55.379 --> 00:34:01.906
<v Josh Sparkes>New pay, new payer. Yeah. And so, yeah,
basically what it says.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/162-1
00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:08.739
<v Josh Sparkes>So we will be requested to add a new peer
for that matter and and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/163-0
00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:14.156
<v Josh Sparkes>The request that actually requested
through 3D at the moment,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/163-1
00:34:14.156 --> 00:34:17.526
<v Josh Sparkes>so that will pop up in 3D for the team
they go in,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/163-2
00:34:17.526 --> 00:34:23.011
<v Josh Sparkes>they do something and send to compliance
and approval and then once compliance has</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/163-3
00:34:23.011 --> 00:34:27.967
<v Josh Sparkes>approved again it comes through well
actually that that part comes through</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/163-4
00:34:27.967 --> 00:34:29.619
<v Josh Sparkes>share will at the moment.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/164-0
00:34:29.819 --> 00:34:34.346
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the team will go in and do what
they need to do and see to conclude the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/164-1
00:34:34.346 --> 00:34:36.973
<v Josh Sparkes>task.
So that's that was a task that you would</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/164-2
00:34:36.973 --> 00:34:40.662
<v Josh Sparkes>need to still have. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
It comes in from that. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/164-3
00:34:40.662 --> 00:34:42.619
<v Josh Sparkes>It comes from compliance. Yeah. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/166-0
00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:53.524
<v Josh Sparkes>And the two of mine,
so and I know that we're talking probably</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/166-1
00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:57.761
<v Josh Sparkes>at a global level here.
Is there any localization difference?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/166-2
00:34:57.761 --> 00:35:01.520
<v Josh Sparkes>So in the area in the can I just go back,
yeah, sorry,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/166-3
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:06.919
<v Josh Sparkes>the piece should go into 3E and do the
request you will sometimes get requests</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/166-4
00:35:06.919 --> 00:35:07.739
<v Josh Sparkes>from the PE.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/167-0
00:35:08.099 --> 00:35:11.475
<v Josh Sparkes>And through share will. Yeah.
So you may get a request to,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/167-1
00:35:11.475 --> 00:35:15.138
<v Josh Sparkes>you know to attach it,
then they're going to three do what they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/167-2
00:35:15.138 --> 00:35:18.056
<v Josh Sparkes>need to do,
send for approval to compliance and in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/167-3
00:35:18.056 --> 00:35:22.177
<v Josh Sparkes>compliance then do the second part where
that also comes to share will.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/167-4
00:35:22.177 --> 00:35:23.379
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've either got.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/168-0
00:35:25.179 --> 00:35:28.979
<v Josh Sparkes>Adds peer or you've got a peer approved.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/169-0
00:35:31.259 --> 00:35:35.069
<v Josh Sparkes>The peer approved is strong compliance,
OK, but ad payer,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/169-1
00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:39.798
<v Josh Sparkes>there's three approvals to have to be
done. Yes, have to be done. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/169-2
00:35:39.798 --> 00:35:43.279
<v Josh Sparkes>but that's,
but that's in place that they do that on</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/169-3
00:35:43.279 --> 00:35:44.659
<v Josh Sparkes>the client side, yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/170-0
00:35:49.539 --> 00:35:52.446
<v Josh Sparkes>And then when that receives,
when you receive it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/170-1
00:35:52.446 --> 00:35:56.806
<v Josh Sparkes>you then check that you've got approval.
Do you? Then what do you do next?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/170-2
00:35:56.806 --> 00:36:01.340
<v Josh Sparkes>Then what's the sort of cheques in place
so we won't receive the request from</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/170-3
00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:05.003
<v Josh Sparkes>three? So different applications,
that's how it should happen.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/170-4
00:36:05.003 --> 00:36:08.259
<v Josh Sparkes>Or the PE may come to us and that they
should be doing.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/171-0
00:36:08.339 --> 00:36:13.728
<v Josh Sparkes>In three E what we do in three E actually
generates and we click on generate and it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/171-1
00:36:13.728 --> 00:36:18.861
<v Josh Sparkes>sends a compliance request to compliance
to then do their cheques and then when</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/171-2
00:36:18.861 --> 00:36:23.608
<v Josh Sparkes>they confirm that's approved and then
comes back and to share well to see</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/171-3
00:36:23.608 --> 00:36:27.779
<v Josh Sparkes>approved. So we know it's all approved,
they've done everything.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/172-0
00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:31.697
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we'll just go and attach the new
peer to the matter.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/172-1
00:36:31.697 --> 00:36:36.206
<v Josh Sparkes>Let's go back once you go into 3 E.
Is that right? Yes. And then that's it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/172-2
00:36:36.206 --> 00:36:40.775
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm thinking prior to that in sense
now you'll have a task in order to do</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/172-3
00:36:40.775 --> 00:36:44.454
<v Josh Sparkes>this work, I mean potentially, yeah.
So potentially you will,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/172-4
00:36:44.454 --> 00:36:47.539
<v Josh Sparkes>you shouldn't do potentially what should
happen is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/173-0
00:36:47.739 --> 00:36:51.726
<v Josh Sparkes>The PE should go to three EE and then
request for a new peer.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/173-1
00:36:51.726 --> 00:36:56.614
<v Josh Sparkes>That's how it should happen, right?
But they still come to us and ask us to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/173-2
00:36:56.614 --> 00:36:59.830
<v Josh Sparkes>do it. Yeah.
And then we have to go back and see.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/173-3
00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:04.139
<v Josh Sparkes>You have to. I'm wondering. Joan,
team and Ruth, whether that's a.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/174-0
00:37:04.579 --> 00:37:10.125
<v Josh Sparkes>Educational change is. Yeah, that's like,
that's a roles and responsibility on them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/174-1
00:37:10.125 --> 00:37:15.085
<v Josh Sparkes>That's actually, I can ask somebody. Yeah,
sometimes prepare just to do it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/174-2
00:37:15.085 --> 00:37:19.979
<v Josh Sparkes>But they're asking you to do what?
Something. Yeah. Yeah, that is. That's.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/175-0
00:37:20.299 --> 00:37:22.947
<v Josh Sparkes>What should happen?
There should be something there to say</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/175-1
00:37:22.947 --> 00:37:24.339
<v Josh Sparkes>you need to do SPF three, yeah?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/176-0
00:37:30.539 --> 00:37:30.579
<v Josh Sparkes>I.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/177-0
00:37:33.899 --> 00:37:37.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Stage gates touches.
Sorry anybody touches their rate.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/177-1
00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:41.454
<v Josh Sparkes>What I've seen in other legal firms and
professional services.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/177-2
00:37:41.454 --> 00:37:46.449
<v Josh Sparkes>There is some sort of even if it's a one
hour e-learning module or half a day</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/177-3
00:37:46.449 --> 00:37:50.099
<v Josh Sparkes>training course on how you manage rates,
how you manage.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/178-0
00:37:50.779 --> 00:37:55.729
<v Josh Sparkes>Feeling like so that people don't input a
rubbish **** terrain or there's, I think,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/178-1
00:37:55.729 --> 00:37:58.616
<v Josh Sparkes>the people I think we're watching in the
PE tab.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/178-2
00:37:58.616 --> 00:38:01.327
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm assuming they have some sort of
shipping,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/178-3
00:38:01.327 --> 00:38:06.277
<v Josh Sparkes>but there is there is on the billing side,
which we are also going to be refreshing</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/178-4
00:38:06.277 --> 00:38:09.459
<v Josh Sparkes>by the end of this year as well.
That includes rates.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/179-0
00:38:10.299 --> 00:38:13.075
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know,
but we would include anyways.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/179-1
00:38:13.075 --> 00:38:17.619
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean if it is, even if it is there,
we would be improving that piece.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/180-0
00:38:18.899 --> 00:38:23.633
<v Josh Sparkes>So and sorry I I I I don't think so.
The I think P ES involvement is more of a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/180-1
00:38:23.633 --> 00:38:27.828
<v Josh Sparkes>messenger over here and I think they
they're not gonna be agreeing or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/180-2
00:38:27.828 --> 00:38:31.424
<v Josh Sparkes>disagreeing or anything.
I think they will just pass on the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/180-3
00:38:31.424 --> 00:38:34.540
<v Josh Sparkes>information.
I think that's the piece you know they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/180-4
00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:35.379
<v Josh Sparkes>have to cover.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/182-0
00:38:36.099 --> 00:38:41.245
<v Josh Sparkes>I've had meetings with P ES before like
general meetings and actually about this</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/182-1
00:38:41.245 --> 00:38:46.645
<v Josh Sparkes>and explains how it should be all of them,
but I've done groups before and there has</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/182-2
00:38:46.645 --> 00:38:51.981
<v Josh Sparkes>been some of them that that are not sure,
so I don't know if there's a gap there in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/182-3
00:38:51.981 --> 00:38:52.299
<v Josh Sparkes>mind.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/183-0
00:38:52.499 --> 00:38:56.002
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll do it. This is something to consider,
and we'll make a note.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/183-1
00:38:56.002 --> 00:38:59.718
<v Josh Sparkes>But for consistency and to save the
one-on-one or side conversations,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/183-2
00:38:59.718 --> 00:39:03.699
<v Josh Sparkes>it may be worth you have no definitely
make a note because we are actually</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/183-3
00:39:03.699 --> 00:39:06.990
<v Josh Sparkes>actively working on the refresher modules
for these training.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/183-4
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:10.175
<v Josh Sparkes>So anybody like the current PES and also
the new PE joiner,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/183-5
00:39:10.175 --> 00:39:12.299
<v Josh Sparkes>so that would help us to add that, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/184-0
00:39:12.859 --> 00:39:17.902
<v Josh Sparkes>And and you will see today and tomorrow
you will see this kind of comments and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/184-1
00:39:17.902 --> 00:39:22.882
<v Josh Sparkes>statements from us because a lot of
responsibilities are mixed up between the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/184-2
00:39:22.882 --> 00:39:25.819
<v Josh Sparkes>two groups.
So Rama billing and the B groups.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/185-0
00:39:28.059 --> 00:39:32.225
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes. So I mean that's ideal,
but presumably there are the ones that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/185-1
00:39:32.225 --> 00:39:36.207
<v Josh Sparkes>time constraints on them,
whatever it might be they or not sure.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/185-2
00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:40.801
<v Josh Sparkes>So they would like that reassurance to
get better. That could be a change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/185-3
00:39:40.801 --> 00:39:44.783
<v Josh Sparkes>But and again in service no,
it captures obviously the requester</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/185-4
00:39:44.783 --> 00:39:46.499
<v Josh Sparkes>consistent piece you can be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/186-0
00:39:46.939 --> 00:39:49.790
<v Josh Sparkes>The same PE Democrat has been the same
thing,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/186-1
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:53.942
<v Josh Sparkes>and I'm sort of mulling it in my head all
week about these things.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/186-2
00:39:53.942 --> 00:39:56.731
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know if it's, you know,
parking lot,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/186-3
00:39:56.731 --> 00:40:01.256
<v Josh Sparkes>but they're incorporating into
professional development plans. You know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/186-4
00:40:01.256 --> 00:40:03.859
<v Josh Sparkes>we do etcetera that they incentivize that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/187-0
00:40:04.499 --> 00:40:09.235
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, I'm being reviewed on this as well.
It formalises it and the other thing we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/187-1
00:40:09.235 --> 00:40:13.852
<v Josh Sparkes>can do is I generally find people are
quite competitive and they feel inside,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/187-2
00:40:13.852 --> 00:40:17.523
<v Josh Sparkes>so having the dashboard maybe not calling
out particular PDS,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/187-3
00:40:17.523 --> 00:40:21.489
<v Josh Sparkes>but if they put part particular
opportunism teams. If you're like,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/187-4
00:40:21.489 --> 00:40:22.259
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/188-0
00:40:22.819 --> 00:40:26.758
<v Josh Sparkes>The transaction team are always like 95%,
but this team is 65%.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/188-1
00:40:26.758 --> 00:40:30.759
<v Josh Sparkes>It kind of generally drives like better
hygiene across everyone.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/188-2
00:40:30.759 --> 00:40:35.068
<v Josh Sparkes>It's so publicly displayed and also we
have regular meetings with me.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/188-3
00:40:35.068 --> 00:40:36.299
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't really see.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/189-0
00:40:39.059 --> 00:40:43.730
<v Josh Sparkes>Then what you're saying, Ruth?
We have exactly something on the E</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/189-1
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:49.393
<v Josh Sparkes>billing side where you know some of the E
bills which are sitting with the PES.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/189-2
00:40:49.393 --> 00:40:54.419
<v Josh Sparkes>They are highlighted on an MI and we
shared that MI on a weekly basis.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/190-0
00:40:54.739 --> 00:40:57.339
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just a case that with Rama we have
not.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/190-1
00:40:57.339 --> 00:41:02.194
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean we we are not that far in terms of
having those kind of discussions with the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/190-2
00:41:02.194 --> 00:41:04.621
<v Josh Sparkes>PE.
There are other bigger issues to deal</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/190-3
00:41:04.621 --> 00:41:09.071
<v Josh Sparkes>with them right now and actually the
training is one of them to kind of like</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/190-4
00:41:09.071 --> 00:41:12.539
<v Josh Sparkes>send the training and then see what are
the gaps they have.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/192-0
00:41:12.939 --> 00:41:17.108
<v Josh Sparkes>And that is why I said in the picnic that
I would be very keen to understand what</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/192-1
00:41:17.108 --> 00:41:19.447
<v Josh Sparkes>OPS are doing at the back of the service
now,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/192-2
00:41:19.447 --> 00:41:21.379
<v Josh Sparkes>because we would be at the downstream.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/193-0
00:41:25.539 --> 00:41:26.299
<v Josh Sparkes>But it comes to you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/194-0
00:41:28.699 --> 00:41:32.673
<v Josh Sparkes>Hopefully I don't know how many times you
get them and then you would have their</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/194-1
00:41:32.673 --> 00:41:35.617
<v Josh Sparkes>own questions. Thanks.
Now that you need to go and do that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/194-2
00:41:35.617 --> 00:41:39.248
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think it's that point sort of
landing with yourself then the cheques</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/194-3
00:41:39.248 --> 00:41:43.173
<v Josh Sparkes>that you have to do. And so it's not,
you know again because doesn't want to be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/194-4
00:41:43.173 --> 00:41:46.019
<v Josh Sparkes>labour intensive,
but it says I've gone into three years.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/195-0
00:41:47.659 --> 00:41:53.090
<v Josh Sparkes>And suppose maybe there's three before
pass that we do, for which that's. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/195-1
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.417
<v Josh Sparkes>this stuff. Yes,
we've got the request that most</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/195-2
00:41:56.417 --> 00:42:00.083
<v Josh Sparkes>importantly,
once this requested and client approval,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/195-3
00:42:00.083 --> 00:42:04.768
<v Josh Sparkes>that has ought to come through to
physically share at least through.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/195-4
00:42:04.768 --> 00:42:05.379
<v Josh Sparkes>So we're.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/196-0
00:42:05.859 --> 00:42:08.482
<v Josh Sparkes>Aware that compliance has been through
them,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/196-1
00:42:08.482 --> 00:42:13.087
<v Josh Sparkes>and then how do you request compliance
approval so that's through sweet needs.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/196-2
00:42:13.087 --> 00:42:17.575
<v Josh Sparkes>So we generate one we generate that that
was to compliance but then wouldn't</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/196-3
00:42:17.575 --> 00:42:22.413
<v Josh Sparkes>compliance approves that it comes back to
us as a ticket and then we won't do what</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/196-4
00:42:22.413 --> 00:42:25.619
<v Josh Sparkes>we need to do. Yeah.
So I'm thinking about States and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/197-0
00:42:25.899 --> 00:42:31.632
<v Josh Sparkes>So typically in the service now to be new
work in progress and close complete in a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/197-1
00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:35.500
<v Josh Sparkes>very short task,
I'm not suggesting that then losing to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/197-2
00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.816
<v Josh Sparkes>awaiting requests for approval, you know,
yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/197-3
00:42:38.816 --> 00:42:43.859
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be that that is approval
complete from compliance of the check.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/198-0
00:42:44.299 --> 00:42:48.044
<v Josh Sparkes>The next one and then it closes complete.
So if you new state,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/198-1
00:42:48.044 --> 00:42:51.612
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just the fact that you know that
it's that's very bad.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/198-2
00:42:51.612 --> 00:42:56.368
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't think that would be helpful or
whether you would want something that is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/198-3
00:42:56.368 --> 00:42:59.579
<v Josh Sparkes>in waiting request for approval thing on
a dashboard.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/199-0
00:43:00.259 --> 00:43:04.383
<v Josh Sparkes>No more than ageing,
you can just see them that they used to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/199-1
00:43:04.383 --> 00:43:09.521
<v Josh Sparkes>be worked on. I mean, how? I mean,
it might be that there's such short turn</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/199-2
00:43:09.521 --> 00:43:14.659
<v Josh Sparkes>around that it has it's diluted,
but so we request the approval via 3, yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/200-0
00:43:14.979 --> 00:43:18.234
<v Josh Sparkes>But I'm thinking service now it's a part
of your task. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/200-1
00:43:18.234 --> 00:43:21.810
<v Josh Sparkes>you're still it's it's you're tracking
that task on the dashboard.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/200-2
00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:25.066
<v Josh Sparkes>And if you haven't heard back,
it's something you can chase.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/200-3
00:43:25.066 --> 00:43:28.161
<v Josh Sparkes>So how would you track that?
I fix it's a request. Sorry.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/200-4
00:43:28.161 --> 00:43:32.110
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just trying to think about logical.
The request is coming from three.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/200-5
00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:34.779
<v Josh Sparkes>We used to be sending that request to
compliance.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/201-0
00:43:35.499 --> 00:43:40.858
<v Josh Sparkes>How would that track when you've just
literally on your tasks will be awaiting</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/201-1
00:43:40.858 --> 00:43:45.879
<v Josh Sparkes>you know tickets, not an automatic?
So what is hard scopeable service now</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/201-2
00:43:45.879 --> 00:43:50.628
<v Josh Sparkes>that you're doing, you know,
it's your ability that you're working on</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/201-3
00:43:50.628 --> 00:43:54.699
<v Josh Sparkes>and you can have a check box that says
I've I've requested.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/202-0
00:43:54.739 --> 00:43:57.673
<v Josh Sparkes>Approval.
So it's effectively just the check,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/202-1
00:43:57.673 --> 00:44:02.521
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not an integration between the two.
So it's an open ticket that you're</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/202-2
00:44:02.521 --> 00:44:06.412
<v Josh Sparkes>working on and it doesn't come in as a
ticket though, sorry,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/202-3
00:44:06.412 --> 00:44:11.261
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just going to ask about that.
So how does it currently come in and we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/202-4
00:44:11.261 --> 00:44:14.259
<v Josh Sparkes>use work in 3E and do that work,
so we've got.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/203-0
00:44:14.379 --> 00:44:18.203
<v Josh Sparkes>Share well, just now. No,
unless the PE request that which they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/203-1
00:44:18.203 --> 00:44:22.863
<v Josh Sparkes>shouldn't be doing and that's what we're
going to push back on what it should</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/203-2
00:44:22.863 --> 00:44:27.524
<v Josh Sparkes>happen is they should is in three.
So it's like AQ as when we do AQA cheques,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/203-3
00:44:27.524 --> 00:44:32.005
<v Josh Sparkes>we also have new peers in there.
It's unless that you can see OK and on so</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/203-4
00:44:32.005 --> 00:44:33.619
<v Josh Sparkes>are you going into 3E on a?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/204-0
00:44:33.899 --> 00:44:39.483
<v Josh Sparkes>A yearly basis of revenue and it actually
pops up as a notification entry as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/204-1
00:44:39.483 --> 00:44:44.933
<v Josh Sparkes>When there's one that's put a new one.
So we go in there and there's a couple of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/204-2
00:44:44.933 --> 00:44:49.037
<v Josh Sparkes>bits the team does,
then the clutch and then it was straight</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/204-3
00:44:49.037 --> 00:44:52.535
<v Josh Sparkes>to compliance.
So we don't touch share well at that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/204-4
00:44:52.535 --> 00:44:52.939
<v Josh Sparkes>point.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/205-0
00:44:53.419 --> 00:44:56.367
<v Josh Sparkes>Then compliance,
do whatever they do and when they've</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/205-1
00:44:56.367 --> 00:44:59.206
<v Josh Sparkes>approved it,
we then get a ticket and share will to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/205-2
00:44:59.206 --> 00:45:03.628
<v Josh Sparkes>see compliance approval and then we go
back in three and do what else we need to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/205-3
00:45:03.628 --> 00:45:06.413
<v Josh Sparkes>do right.
So you have got a case service and share</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/205-4
00:45:06.413 --> 00:45:09.415
<v Josh Sparkes>will for this.
So when did that case service come into</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/205-5
00:45:09.415 --> 00:45:13.019
<v Josh Sparkes>place? So the case service is compliant,
so we'll get compliance.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/206-0
00:45:13.059 --> 00:45:17.938
<v Josh Sparkes>It's approval and then we've got the
other one when it's a new peer one which</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/206-1
00:45:17.938 --> 00:45:21.691
<v Josh Sparkes>PS option be doing.
But yeah they still they both sometimes</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/206-2
00:45:21.691 --> 00:45:25.882
<v Josh Sparkes>come through and ask. OK,
so that's just a query then from the PE,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/206-3
00:45:25.882 --> 00:45:30.823
<v Josh Sparkes>so they're just emailing and their query
or the new peer that's why you've got</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/206-4
00:45:30.823 --> 00:45:31.699
<v Josh Sparkes>that category.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/209-0
00:45:32.379 --> 00:45:35.516
<v Mark Sedge>So so that sorry,
can I ask a quick question?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/207-0
00:45:32.699 --> 00:45:33.939
<v Josh Sparkes>That same yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/209-1
00:45:35.516 --> 00:45:38.926
<v Mark Sedge>So that notification that comes into
Cherwell is,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/208-0
00:45:35.539 --> 00:45:37.619
<v Josh Sparkes>And if you don't check that beginning,
Scott.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/209-2
00:45:38.926 --> 00:45:44.586
<v Mark Sedge>does that come just from EE via an e-mail
address and Cherwell just churns it to a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/209-3
00:45:44.586 --> 00:45:49.019
<v Mark Sedge>ticket or how does that actively create
the ticket, do you know?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/210-0
00:45:50.419 --> 00:45:53.859
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think General didn't connect me.
If I'm wrong, sorry.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/210-1
00:45:53.859 --> 00:45:58.348
<v Josh Sparkes>You only get an e-mail and when it's
compliance and the compliance team will</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/210-2
00:45:58.348 --> 00:46:01.496
<v Josh Sparkes>send that e-mail to you,
it's not anything that comes</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/210-3
00:46:01.496 --> 00:46:05.461
<v Josh Sparkes>automatically from three E I'm going to
double check with the team.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/210-4
00:46:05.461 --> 00:46:09.192
<v Josh Sparkes>Just I did say true as well.
The reason they're asking right is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/210-5
00:46:09.192 --> 00:46:09.659
<v Josh Sparkes>because.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/211-0
00:46:09.739 --> 00:46:16.212
<v Josh Sparkes>Because if you are sitting in 3E awaiting
notifications and having to manually be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/211-1
00:46:16.212 --> 00:46:22.291
<v Josh Sparkes>in that all day, but in three all day,
is there any need for an integration?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/211-2
00:46:22.291 --> 00:46:24.739
<v Josh Sparkes>Do we need to count it in here?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/213-0
00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:29.672
<v Josh Sparkes>Well, yeah,
we do need to know what's been approved,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/213-1
00:46:29.672 --> 00:46:32.459
<v Josh Sparkes>the compliance e-mail from their mailbox
though.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/212-0
00:46:30.419 --> 00:46:31.019
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, there's.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/214-0
00:46:34.299 --> 00:46:35.139
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what you're checking.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/216-0
00:46:36.339 --> 00:46:38.937
<v Mark Sedge>I think there's a couple of things on
that. One,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/216-1
00:46:38.937 --> 00:46:42.915
<v Mark Sedge>if there's tasks to be done downstream
and these guys want to manage their</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/216-2
00:46:42.915 --> 00:46:45.195
<v Mark Sedge>workload,
then you would want to know that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/216-3
00:46:45.195 --> 00:46:48.483
<v Mark Sedge>something's come in.
So someone takes action so you can track</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/216-4
00:46:48.483 --> 00:46:52.619
<v Mark Sedge>the duration of the action. You know,
it helps with demand management of your</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/216-5
00:46:52.619 --> 00:46:55.059
<v Mark Sedge>throughput work for the team.
But I was just.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/217-0
00:46:55.619 --> 00:47:00.366
<v Mark Sedge>I I think the interesting thing or the
the key thing would be to make sure that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/217-1
00:47:00.366 --> 00:47:04.639
<v Mark Sedge>one I think that that whatever we get in
is easily easily identifiable.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/217-2
00:47:04.639 --> 00:47:08.793
<v Mark Sedge>So when it comes into ServiceNow,
one assumes it's going to come into</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/217-3
00:47:08.793 --> 00:47:10.099
<v Mark Sedge>ServiceNow instead of.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/220-0
00:47:11.219 --> 00:47:13.643
<v Mark Sedge>Obviously,
instead of Cherwell 1 assumes when it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/218-0
00:47:13.379 --> 00:47:13.619
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/220-1
00:47:13.643 --> 00:47:16.810
<v Mark Sedge>comes into ServiceNow,
we want to make sure we've got the right</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/220-2
00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:20.620
<v Mark Sedge>string of text or we've got the right
information to trigger the appropriate</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/219-0
00:47:18.139 --> 00:47:18.259
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/220-3
00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:23.292
<v Mark Sedge>activities.
Without these guys having to sift through</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/220-4
00:47:23.292 --> 00:47:26.557
<v Mark Sedge>a great list and try and work out which
ones again and which one,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/220-5
00:47:26.557 --> 00:47:30.219
<v Mark Sedge>because we've seen that from a number of
the previous sessions we've had.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/222-0
00:47:30.739 --> 00:47:34.047
<v Mark Sedge>Stuff comes in and it's so generic.
The guys almost have to open every</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/221-0
00:47:31.059 --> 00:47:31.339
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/222-1
00:47:34.047 --> 00:47:35.539
<v Mark Sedge>notification to know what it is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/223-0
00:47:36.819 --> 00:47:37.579
<v Mark Sedge>Is that fair?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/224-0
00:47:38.499 --> 00:47:41.102
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I'm going to go just double check with</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/224-1
00:47:41.102 --> 00:47:45.209
<v Josh Sparkes>the team in regards to that,
but that's my understanding of that part.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/224-2
00:47:45.209 --> 00:47:49.201
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm definitely for the approval.
It was three and any ticket council</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/224-3
00:47:49.201 --> 00:47:53.366
<v Josh Sparkes>Gallians and then we'll get requests
which we spoke about pushing back.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/224-4
00:47:53.366 --> 00:47:56.779
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just going to double checking.
We've asked it because.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/227-0
00:47:56.939 --> 00:48:01.034

Perfect. Yeah.</v>

<v Josh Sparkes>So which would be generated? Yeah, yeah,
that's good. And then in travel today,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/225-0

<v Mark Sedge>Cool.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/226-0

<v Josh Sparkes>And if there's a lady peer and they're
the same peer. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/229-1

<v Josh Sparkes>And if there's a duplicate,
and if there appears a lady there and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/229-2
00:48:39.905 --> 00:48:44.907

00:48:44.907 --> 00:48:47.819
<v Josh Sparkes>peer. He is not there. We create a new.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/230-0
00:48:48.259 --> 00:48:52.158
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. So yeah,

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/230-1
00:48:52.158 --> 00:48:57.263

So and then you've got an audit trail and</v>

<v Josh Sparkes>bring the actual request to make sure
they do as well or they will start</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/231-4
00:49:25.219 --> 00:49:25.739

00:49:31.979 --> 00:49:36.381
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, that's an interesting one.
When it's done from as you said,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/233-1
00:49:36.381 --> 00:49:41.042
<v Josh Sparkes>the from compliance and three E,
it's tagging that as not alluded to is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/233-2
00:49:41.042 --> 00:49:45.250
<v Josh Sparkes>getting that string that they requested.
Whoever did that, yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/233-3
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:49.134
<v Josh Sparkes>it's part of that string.
So that you're not charming. Yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/233-4
00:49:49.134 --> 00:49:51.659
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean that's the bit that we probably.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/234-0
00:49:52.219 --> 00:49:56.517
<v Josh Sparkes>I can have a look at so as you've got
that professor information. Otherwise,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/234-1
00:49:56.517 --> 00:49:59.587
<v Josh Sparkes>who do you notify? I mean,
how do you find that input?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/234-2
00:49:59.587 --> 00:50:02.099
<v Josh Sparkes>How do you go back in if you just,
you know?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/235-0
00:50:05.899 --> 00:50:06.219

00:50:07.819 --> 00:50:13.859
<v Josh Sparkes>It is, it is zero.
It is of this one that's already to 70.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/237-0
00:50:08.819 --> 00:50:11.587
<v Mark Sedge>Sorry,
can I be cheeky and just ask for the MIC</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/237-1
00:50:11.587 --> 00:50:15.739
<v Mark Sedge>again on that I missed. Sorry,
I just missed what you were saying then.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/238-0
00:50:17.539 --> 00:50:17.819
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/239-0
00:50:29.859 --> 00:50:30.219
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/240-0
00:50:30.579 --> 00:50:31.259
<v Mark Sedge>Thanks Joe.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/241-0
00:50:34.419 --> 00:50:39.696
<v Josh Sparkes>When you're doing your break time,
your own pad single,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/241-1
00:50:39.696 --> 00:50:46.859
<v Josh Sparkes>we can switch it off so that you're is
that better? Yeah, that sounds good.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/242-0
00:50:47.659 --> 00:50:48.019
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/243-0
00:50:48.059 --> 00:50:49.659
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not getting up.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/244-0
00:50:50.179 --> 00:50:51.419
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, a little bit. Thank you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/245-0
00:50:57.099 --> 00:50:59.859
<v Mark Sedge>Oh, no, not now.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/247-0
00:51:00.379 --> 00:51:06.776
<v Josh Sparkes>Screen that's good.
Try that now that better. It's good.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/247-1
00:51:06.776 --> 00:51:15.419
<v Josh Sparkes>It sounds good. Can you hear this one?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Find your question.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/246-0
00:51:06.979 --> 00:51:08.779
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, that's OK. Should be able to get it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/248-0
00:51:16.179 --> 00:51:20.300
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So,
so obviously we've done what we've had to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/248-1
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:26.481
<v Josh Sparkes>do. We've requested it to compliance,
then compliance will send us the ticket</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/248-2
00:51:26.481 --> 00:51:32.187
<v Josh Sparkes>via share well seeing approved.
So the team will went in and do what we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/248-3
00:51:32.187 --> 00:51:33.059
<v Josh Sparkes>need to do.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/250-0
00:51:33.539 --> 00:51:38.193
<v Josh Sparkes>And then they have to go back to share
will and they have to reply all quite</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/250-1
00:51:38.193 --> 00:51:42.907
<v Josh Sparkes>often the original request was not
included from e-mail like from compliance.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/250-2
00:51:42.907 --> 00:51:47.440
<v Josh Sparkes>So they've just sent the e-mail to us.
So then you have to Scroll down the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/250-3
00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.275
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail to be able to make sure that so
when you get that query now it says that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/250-4
00:51:52.275 --> 00:51:52.819
<v Josh Sparkes>you know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/251-0
00:51:52.939 --> 00:51:57.105
<v Josh Sparkes>My question obviously won't be through,
you know, research now,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/251-1
00:51:57.105 --> 00:52:00.750
<v Josh Sparkes>so you'll have that original request
within the on. No,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/251-2
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:05.372
<v Josh Sparkes>because it was because it comes from
three E yeah, it's not coming to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/251-3
00:52:05.372 --> 00:52:09.539
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not coming through from Shell well.
So it pops up into 3E.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/252-0
00:52:09.859 --> 00:52:15.611
<v Josh Sparkes>Tells us that some of these requested NCE
needless bartending to generally</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/252-1
00:52:15.611 --> 00:52:20.443
<v Josh Sparkes>compliance approval,
that there was nothing to do with sharing</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/252-2
00:52:20.443 --> 00:52:24.739
<v Josh Sparkes>that goes to them.
And then when they do their cheques.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/253-0
00:52:25.019 --> 00:52:29.269
<v Josh Sparkes>They then send us an e-mail that was to
share will and then there's.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/253-1
00:52:29.269 --> 00:52:34.197
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think that's probably something we
can park probably about that three-year</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/253-2
00:52:34.197 --> 00:52:37.092
<v Josh Sparkes>upgrades.
But I mean if you don't know who the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/253-3
00:52:37.092 --> 00:52:41.219
<v Josh Sparkes>original request there is,
but that I want to do a lot of efforts.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/254-0
00:52:42.179 --> 00:52:43.699
<v Josh Sparkes>That's something that we need to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/255-0
00:52:43.259 --> 00:52:48.060
<v Mark Sedge>Is there when they sorry,
when they do the approval and you say</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/255-1
00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:54.437
<v Mark Sedge>generate an e-mail or send you the e-mail,
is it not that they can just give you the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/255-2
00:52:54.437 --> 00:52:58.939
<v Mark Sedge>name of who requested in that e-mail or
is it an automated?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/256-0
00:52:59.899 --> 00:53:01.579
<v Mark Sedge>Systemic generated e-mail.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/258-0
00:53:03.259 --> 00:53:08.420
<v Josh Sparkes>No. So they actually don't know. Actually,
I know that comes from compliance,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/258-1
00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:12.589
<v Josh Sparkes>you know a champion probably the way it
comes from compliance,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/258-2
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:17.883
<v Josh Sparkes>be able to look through and be able to
find manage automated being able then to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/258-3
00:53:17.883 --> 00:53:22.979
<v Josh Sparkes>find and expressed at the bottom of the
e-mail and willing to search for it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/260-0
00:53:23.539 --> 00:53:26.859
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's something we must be noted,
yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/257-0
00:53:24.019 --> 00:53:24.139
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/262-0
00:53:26.059 --> 00:53:29.203
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, because if compliance,
if compliance could give you the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/262-1
00:53:29.203 --> 00:53:32.853
<v Mark Sedge>requester information at the point right
at the top before they launch,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/261-0
00:53:32.259 --> 00:53:35.299
<v Josh Sparkes>That's all, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/262-2
00:53:32.853 --> 00:53:36.048
<v Mark Sedge>then again it's efficient for all the all
of the organisation.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/262-3
00:53:36.048 --> 00:53:39.699
<v Mark Sedge>We should be pushing for efficiency right
across the enterprise, right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/263-0
00:53:40.779 --> 00:53:43.592
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I mean that sounds you know inefficient</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/263-1
00:53:43.592 --> 00:53:46.527
<v Josh Sparkes>all the time.
So I know that's not service now,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/263-2
00:53:46.527 --> 00:53:50.440
<v Josh Sparkes>but three, we can look at,
I know that's something that they're</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/263-3
00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:55.332
<v Josh Sparkes>working on that certainly that request
seems an obvious thing that you in order</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/263-4
00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:56.739
<v Josh Sparkes>for you to notify them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/264-0
00:53:57.339 --> 00:54:00.931
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. OK.
And at that point then it's complete or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/264-1
00:54:00.931 --> 00:54:06.031
<v Josh Sparkes>notify some clients improved and then
request has been informed. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/264-2
00:54:06.031 --> 00:54:11.994
<v Josh Sparkes>So at that point with ensuring they will
building results and that's where we went</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/264-3
00:54:11.994 --> 00:54:15.299
<v Josh Sparkes>into the request to make sure the rule
first.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/265-0
00:54:15.659 --> 00:54:19.288
<v Josh Sparkes>That happens otherwise replace men's
batch cheese.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/265-1
00:54:19.288 --> 00:54:25.123
<v Josh Sparkes>So we want to make sure that the original
replacement is included now resolved to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/265-2
00:54:25.123 --> 00:54:28.681
<v Josh Sparkes>the ticket.
That's smart that microphones are not</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/265-3
00:54:28.681 --> 00:54:33.235
<v Josh Sparkes>working. I think that's good.
I think we've already took space.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/265-4
00:54:33.235 --> 00:54:35.299
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably the easier planning.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/266-0
00:54:37.419 --> 00:54:39.579
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, maybe. Sorry.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/267-0
00:54:41.779 --> 00:54:47.574
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, sorry you can.
So that sounds like a end to end</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/267-1
00:54:47.574 --> 00:54:56.052
<v Josh Sparkes>reasonable straightforward, happy park.
And then we probably touched upon pain</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/267-2
00:54:56.052 --> 00:54:59.379
<v Josh Sparkes>points, what happens when it's?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/268-0
00:55:00.299 --> 00:55:05.591
<v Josh Sparkes>The boys or things go wrong or there's no
approvals or you have to chase or there's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/268-1
00:55:05.591 --> 00:55:08.804
<v Josh Sparkes>some errors.
Does that happen or is it tends to be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/268-2
00:55:08.804 --> 00:55:13.466
<v Josh Sparkes>reasonably straightforward? No,
we will get chasers and so I guess that's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/268-3
00:55:13.466 --> 00:55:17.499
<v Josh Sparkes>when P may have already done the request
through 3E. Yeah, and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/269-0
00:55:18.019 --> 00:55:22.277
<v Josh Sparkes>I've not heard anything,
so we will then get the query. Yes. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/269-1
00:55:22.277 --> 00:55:26.090
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe through share.
Well or you know ServiceNow, whatever.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/269-2
00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:31.365
<v Josh Sparkes>Get the query and then we have the chief
up compliance to find out where that was,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/269-3
00:55:31.365 --> 00:55:36.449
<v Josh Sparkes>where that is or we've actually checked
the E 1st to make sure that OK approval</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/269-4
00:55:36.449 --> 00:55:37.339
<v Josh Sparkes>has been sent.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/270-0
00:55:37.579 --> 00:55:41.023
<v Josh Sparkes>And then if Approval's been sent,
wouldn't chase compliance up.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/270-1
00:55:41.023 --> 00:55:43.390
<v Josh Sparkes>So some of you know you get over,
you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/270-2
00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:46.888
<v Josh Sparkes>through such you get a query from the PES,
you know as you said,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/270-3
00:55:46.888 --> 00:55:51.301
<v Josh Sparkes>not that they haven't done themselves.
They're basically saying where that. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/270-4
00:55:51.301 --> 00:55:54.099
<v Josh Sparkes>And then you can you will have it on your
keywords.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/271-0
00:55:54.419 --> 00:55:57.690
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it's been assigned.
We talk about the signing,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/271-1
00:55:57.690 --> 00:56:00.900
<v Josh Sparkes>who it goes through linard and then you
will check.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/271-2
00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:05.653
<v Josh Sparkes>So one that could be checking with
compatible checking with clients and then</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/271-3
00:56:05.653 --> 00:56:08.739
<v Josh Sparkes>the outcome of that and then you go
through that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/272-0
00:56:10.219 --> 00:56:14.005
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably route of yeah, you know,
being where approval is and it gets</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/272-1
00:56:14.005 --> 00:56:17.899
<v Josh Sparkes>approved, that's straightforward.
But is there any reason why they come</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/272-2
00:56:17.899 --> 00:56:21.252
<v Josh Sparkes>back and compliance,
they will actually it's been rejected or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/272-3
00:56:21.252 --> 00:56:25.633
<v Josh Sparkes>they're even through rejection or yeah
and and that's all on hold for any reason</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/272-4
00:56:25.633 --> 00:56:29.419
<v Josh Sparkes>and there's usually quite good at that
point because then compliance.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/273-0
00:56:29.459 --> 00:56:33.131
<v Josh Sparkes>So go back to the request,
but anyway and they'll tell them it's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/273-1
00:56:33.131 --> 00:56:37.030
<v Josh Sparkes>been checked since. OK. Yeah.
So they don't come through yourself to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/273-2
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:39.911
<v Josh Sparkes>say no. Go. Yes.
But I'm just thinking that that's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/273-3
00:56:39.911 --> 00:56:42.397
<v Josh Sparkes>interesting. Ticket.
So that you're paying.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/273-4
00:56:42.397 --> 00:56:46.409
<v Josh Sparkes>So in your check with compliance and then
they don't come back to you,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/273-5
00:56:46.409 --> 00:56:47.539
<v Josh Sparkes>they go back to the.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/274-0
00:56:48.019 --> 00:56:51.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
it would be in second part of the task</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/274-1
00:56:51.497 --> 00:56:57.138
<v Josh Sparkes>would be attached in the viewer,
but we don't need to do that. It's not,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/274-2
00:56:57.138 --> 00:57:01.080
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not being approved. Yes.
So I guess we don't.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/274-3
00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:05.099
<v Josh Sparkes>And I'm just wondering there's an
opportunity that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/275-0
00:57:05.459 --> 00:57:09.893
<v Josh Sparkes>Actually, so the request have come.
You've got that in service now that's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/275-1
00:57:09.893 --> 00:57:13.728
<v Josh Sparkes>it's embraced it through ServiceNow.
You've gone to compliance.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/275-2
00:57:13.728 --> 00:57:18.642
<v Josh Sparkes>They say that they're they're going to do
it and instead of them informing having</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/275-3
00:57:18.642 --> 00:57:21.339
<v Josh Sparkes>to do that,
it could be that because you're.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/276-0
00:57:22.219 --> 00:57:26.586
<v Josh Sparkes>Not they've confirmed approval,
but then the P gets the request. Yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/276-1
00:57:26.586 --> 00:57:29.393
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
there is obviously there's different</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/276-2
00:57:29.393 --> 00:57:33.198
<v Josh Sparkes>scenarios. You know,
it should be that they do come back and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/276-3
00:57:33.198 --> 00:57:36.879
<v Josh Sparkes>they tell you know,
so it's not all one straightforward to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/276-4
00:57:36.879 --> 00:57:41.059
<v Josh Sparkes>come back and tell us or and they go
straight back in the tail so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/277-0
00:57:41.539 --> 00:57:45.061
<v Josh Sparkes>There is a probably a little bit of
efficiency in between.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/277-1
00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:48.224
<v Josh Sparkes>Find some of self that could be done
there but yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/277-2
00:57:48.224 --> 00:57:52.880
<v Josh Sparkes>so we can either be told it's it's not
approved or they might just they might</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/277-3
00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:57.656
<v Josh Sparkes>actually just go straight to the request
and tell them it's not being approved.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/277-4
00:57:57.656 --> 00:58:00.521
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
Because I'm thinking that that could just</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/277-5
00:58:00.521 --> 00:58:00.939
<v Josh Sparkes>be not.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/278-0
00:58:01.099 --> 00:58:04.789
<v Josh Sparkes>Noted that you could from your
conversations with you guys,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/278-1
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:09.032
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be approved that your questions
updated not approved. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/278-2
00:58:09.032 --> 00:58:13.829
<v Josh Sparkes>obviously gets updated and then reasons
for that could be captured. You know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/278-3
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:16.965
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know how many combinations there
might be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/278-4
00:58:16.965 --> 00:58:19.179
<v Josh Sparkes>There could be a pick list on #1 #2.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/279-0
00:58:20.779 --> 00:58:25.769
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you can do and then they get
important in that and then you've got</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/279-1
00:58:25.769 --> 00:58:30.560
<v Josh Sparkes>these metrics that you know why
measurements that have been approved or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/279-2
00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:34.619
<v Josh Sparkes>rejected account that can then be
insights that can correct.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/280-0
00:58:34.899 --> 00:58:38.270
<v Josh Sparkes>I've got stream processes here. Thank you.
Interesting,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/280-1
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:42.665
<v Josh Sparkes>but I'm I'm guessing I'm guessing we
conclude reports something here the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/280-2
00:58:42.665 --> 00:58:47.240
<v Josh Sparkes>morning because that's where we have
approved or reject. I'm guessing. Yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/280-3
00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:52.056
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just thinking of managing task that
you're updating the person that they've</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/280-4
00:58:52.056 --> 00:58:52.779
<v Josh Sparkes>come to you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/281-0
00:58:52.979 --> 00:58:55.827
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes,
it's that handshake and then you're just</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/281-1
00:58:55.827 --> 00:58:59.728
<v Josh Sparkes>updating that handshake on that
notification. But as you said,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/281-2
00:58:59.728 --> 00:59:04.187
<v Josh Sparkes>ideally it's managed outside,
but these are the ones that land with you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/281-3
00:59:04.187 --> 00:59:09.265
<v Josh Sparkes>are having to manage it and it's giving,
I don't know how many what the volume is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/281-4
00:59:09.265 --> 00:59:12.299
<v Josh Sparkes>like, they're quite high.
I don't know how many.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/282-0
00:59:12.659 --> 00:59:17.762
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Yeah. Wait, there is a lot,
but presumably pushing back that change</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/282-1
00:59:17.762 --> 00:59:22.653
<v Josh Sparkes>you might, yes, maybe reduce that number,
that was still a lot, yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/282-2
00:59:22.653 --> 00:59:26.339
<v Josh Sparkes>But the queries that now we can manage in
that way.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/283-0
00:59:28.179 --> 00:59:32.681
<v Josh Sparkes>Can I just ask a quick question?
I'm assuming that they get alerts anyway</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/283-1
00:59:32.681 --> 00:59:35.844
<v Josh Sparkes>from three E directly themselves,
so usually no no,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/283-2
00:59:35.844 --> 00:59:40.407
<v Josh Sparkes>there's nothing that's coming out of
three E to say not to the you need to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/283-3
00:59:40.407 --> 00:59:43.084
<v Josh Sparkes>approve these to the not that I'm aware
of.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/283-4
00:59:43.084 --> 00:59:45.579
<v Josh Sparkes>As far as I know it's we getting a layer.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/284-0
00:59:46.539 --> 00:59:49.469
<v Josh Sparkes>On three E because we're in 3E all the
time,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/284-1
00:59:49.469 --> 00:59:54.678
<v Josh Sparkes>so we get an alert of what they have been,
a request. We do what we need to do,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/284-2
00:59:54.678 --> 00:59:59.040
<v Josh Sparkes>then we send that request to compliance.
My assumption is that no,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/284-3
00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.059
<v Josh Sparkes>because the chase, PE chase us.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/285-0
01:00:01.339 --> 01:00:03.958
<v Josh Sparkes>Or that that's the kind of gap I'm trying
to fill,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/285-1
01:00:03.958 --> 01:00:08.016
<v Josh Sparkes>because one would assume that the first
thing they should be as they should be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/285-2
01:00:08.016 --> 01:00:10.277
<v Josh Sparkes>told,
and actually that this needs approval</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/285-3
01:00:10.277 --> 01:00:14.386
<v Josh Sparkes>rather than you being told that this
needs approval and enough to go and chase.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/285-4
01:00:14.386 --> 01:00:18.084
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, always needs approval is absolutely,
yeah. Always needs approval.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/285-5
01:00:18.084 --> 01:00:20.499
<v Josh Sparkes>We just have to do some but is it like
within.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/286-0
01:00:20.979 --> 01:00:24.058
<v Josh Sparkes>Countdown.
So it's like T minus so like datas</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/286-1
01:00:24.058 --> 01:00:27.739
<v Josh Sparkes>escalate if it's not approved within X
number of days.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/287-0
01:00:31.099 --> 01:00:35.494
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the approval needs done.
It gets flagged in VE but Rama needs to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/287-1
01:00:35.494 --> 01:00:38.806
<v Josh Sparkes>do work before the approval can then go
to compliance.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/287-2
01:00:38.806 --> 01:00:43.383
<v Josh Sparkes>So you could technically argue that that
could be updated notification wise</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/287-3
01:00:43.383 --> 01:00:47.899
<v Josh Sparkes>through three directly to the PES,
but my question or my concern would be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/288-0
01:00:48.179 --> 01:00:54.321
<v Josh Sparkes>The amount of notifications they're
getting when they've got no action to do</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/288-1
01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:58.309
<v Josh Sparkes>on them,
say if we start extending the I think so</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/288-2
01:00:58.309 --> 01:01:01.899
<v Josh Sparkes>or even the because the notification is
not.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/289-0
01:01:03.299 --> 01:01:07.271
<v Josh Sparkes>It comes via share will,
so the notification of approved becomes</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/289-1
01:01:07.271 --> 01:01:11.977
<v Josh Sparkes>via share will from from us to say it's
complete jobs complete so they can't</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/289-2
01:01:11.977 --> 01:01:15.765
<v Josh Sparkes>receive notifications.
I'm just trying to think it through my</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/289-3
01:01:15.765 --> 01:01:18.699
<v Josh Sparkes>head.
They can't receive notifications because.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/291-0
01:01:21.499 --> 01:01:24.604
<v Josh Sparkes>Sure to make sense that they should,
but they don't.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/291-1
01:01:24.604 --> 01:01:27.415
<v Josh Sparkes>They send they they do the request and
three E.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/291-2
01:01:27.415 --> 01:01:31.282
<v Josh Sparkes>But I didn't get notifications that it's
been sent to compliance,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/291-3
01:01:31.282 --> 01:01:35.558
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm assuming because they come to us
chasing and I'm guessing they well,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/291-4
01:01:35.558 --> 01:01:39.659
<v Josh Sparkes>they don't get notification that has been
approved because we do get.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/292-0
01:01:40.899 --> 01:01:43.239
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, there's no type.
There's no timelines.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/292-1
01:01:43.239 --> 01:01:46.672
<v Josh Sparkes>It's it's on three E we can see when it's
come in and it pops up,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/292-2
01:01:46.672 --> 01:01:50.053
<v Josh Sparkes>but we generally get done.
But as they came in on the day there,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/292-3
01:01:50.053 --> 01:01:53.537
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, I think, you know,
obviously when I was talking to the three</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/292-4
01:01:53.537 --> 01:01:57.178
<v Josh Sparkes>teams and everything else well,
can I dig it out and see how three ES</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/292-5
01:01:57.178 --> 01:01:59.259
<v Josh Sparkes>getting that in the chair wheel because.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/293-0
01:01:59.379 --> 01:02:04.592
<v Josh Sparkes>Might be something that you we can look
at to simplify it. OK, they don't receive.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/293-1
01:02:04.592 --> 01:02:07.419
<v Josh Sparkes>I am.
I'm sure about 100% they don't receive</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/293-2
01:02:07.419 --> 01:02:12.319
<v Josh Sparkes>any notification because I think they
have certain limited access in terms of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/293-3
01:02:12.319 --> 01:02:15.522
<v Josh Sparkes>what they can do.
They're like kind of more of the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/293-4
01:02:15.522 --> 01:02:16.779
<v Josh Sparkes>initiators and then.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/295-0
01:02:17.299 --> 01:02:20.445
<v Josh Sparkes>That's that's our kind of like our
responsibility.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/295-1
01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:23.222
<v Josh Sparkes>But I think it's an interesting point,
Alex,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/295-2
01:02:23.222 --> 01:02:27.726
<v Josh Sparkes>because I would want to explore that
overall ownership of that workflow,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/295-3
01:02:27.726 --> 01:02:32.600
<v Josh Sparkes>because I think the problem with us is or
our the issue is that it becomes our</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/295-4
01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:36.179
<v Josh Sparkes>problem as soon as it comes,
as soon as they initiate it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/294-0
01:02:36.099 --> 01:02:36.299
<v Mark Sedge>Yep.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/296-0
01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:39.695
<v Josh Sparkes>Where is?
I think it is the operations who should</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/296-1
01:02:39.695 --> 01:02:43.264
<v Josh Sparkes>also have at least partial ownership of
the task as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/296-2
01:02:43.264 --> 01:02:48.002
<v Josh Sparkes>So coming to a point like, I mean yes,
if they get a notification or if they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/296-3
01:02:48.002 --> 01:02:51.570
<v Josh Sparkes>have a dashboard,
I think they are equally responsible to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/296-4
01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:55.447
<v Josh Sparkes>look at the numbers,
open items with them as well because what</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/296-5
01:02:55.447 --> 01:02:55.939
<v Josh Sparkes>they do.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/298-0
01:02:55.979 --> 01:02:59.610
<v Josh Sparkes>Do is right.
Now chase us and we chase compliance and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/298-1
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:04.251
<v Josh Sparkes>we don't have any response.
But the conclusion which is given to the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/298-2
01:03:04.251 --> 01:03:07.210
<v Josh Sparkes>partner is that we have been delaying
this.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/298-3
01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:12.657
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think it's interesting to point to
to mark it down as an joint ownership of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/297-0
01:03:07.539 --> 01:03:07.899
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/298-4
01:03:12.657 --> 01:03:14.339
<v Josh Sparkes>that particular workflow.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/299-0
01:03:14.939 --> 01:03:19.059
<v Josh Sparkes>Within the service now and and operations
and us should track it together.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/300-0
01:03:19.539 --> 01:03:24.058
<v Mark Sedge>Sandy, that's that's a great point, right?
And that's kind of where, yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/300-1
01:03:24.058 --> 01:03:29.059
<v Mark Sedge>we run the risk of implementing a process
that is sub optimal at the start kind of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/300-2
01:03:29.059 --> 01:03:33.820
<v Mark Sedge>thing because you don't have the clear
accountability or ownership of that the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/300-3
01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:38.339
<v Mark Sedge>trigger point and ultimately your team
are sweeping up the failure demand.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/302-0
01:03:38.459 --> 01:03:42.609
<v Mark Sedge>Of all the chasing,
all the follow-ups when actually you know</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/302-1
01:03:42.609 --> 01:03:47.896
<v Mark Sedge>the sort of better constructed process
might actually enable everybody to work</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/302-2
01:03:47.896 --> 01:03:48.499
<v Mark Sedge>smoother.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/304-0
01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:53.026
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. No. And and that's why, I mean,
I've been polite in saying partial</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/304-1
01:03:53.026 --> 01:03:55.518
<v Josh Sparkes>ownership,
but I think it should be 100% ownership</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/304-2
01:03:55.518 --> 01:03:59.672
<v Josh Sparkes>operations to be honest with you. I, yeah,
because they are the one what exactly the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/303-0
01:03:55.979 --> 01:03:58.583
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, exactly.
They have the accountability and there's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/303-1
01:03:58.583 --> 01:03:59.979
<v Mark Sedge>a number of responsible steps.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/304-3
01:03:59.672 --> 01:04:03.190
<v Josh Sparkes>other one, what triggering it.
So they should be keeping an eye on it a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/304-4
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:07.100
<v Josh Sparkes>lot of times I had to rush down the 4th
floor to get the compliance guys or the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/304-5
01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:08.859
<v Josh Sparkes>risk and control guys to approve it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/305-0
01:04:08.939 --> 01:04:13.084
<v Josh Sparkes>Do it as well you know. So yes,
it becomes our responsibility in,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/305-1
01:04:13.084 --> 01:04:17.354
<v Josh Sparkes>in a way. But yeah, we don't,
we should not be owning that process.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/305-2
01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:22.190
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think going back to not not on the
process piece but on the service not</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/305-3
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:27.340
<v Josh Sparkes>piece I think dashboard or the ownership
of the workflow that kind of metric will</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/305-4
01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:28.219
<v Josh Sparkes>help you know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/306-0
01:04:28.979 --> 01:04:31.614
<v Josh Sparkes>In between that responsibility and
accountability, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/306-1
01:04:31.614 --> 01:04:35.158
<v Josh Sparkes>ultimately I think we just need to think
about how we do that when we're building</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/306-2
01:04:35.158 --> 01:04:37.059
<v Josh Sparkes>the roles. Yeah.
And things that's because.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/307-0
01:04:39.219 --> 01:04:39.339
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/309-0
01:04:44.859 --> 01:04:47.459
<v Mark Sedge>We've lost sound. Lost sound momentarily.
Sorry.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/308-0
01:04:46.499 --> 01:04:46.739
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/312-0
01:04:48.579 --> 01:05:00.059
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm leaving. That better? That better,
that better.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/310-0
01:04:51.619 --> 01:04:54.979
<v Mark Sedge>I lost it, Alex.
It dropped just before Alex had finished.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/311-0
01:04:57.379 --> 01:04:58.819
<v Mark Sedge>No. Say again.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/313-0
01:05:00.779 --> 01:05:02.499
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, I can hear you.
I couldn't hear Alex.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/314-0
01:05:02.979 --> 01:05:03.219
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/315-0
01:05:17.219 --> 01:05:21.507
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. So yeah, it's Mark's point.
We don't want to put a process in.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/315-1
01:05:21.507 --> 01:05:22.979
<v Josh Sparkes>That's OK, that's good.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/316-0
01:05:23.579 --> 01:05:23.819
<v Josh Sparkes>Umm.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/317-0
01:05:26.139 --> 01:05:32.619
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's the new pay that we part and
then do you want to add any notes to that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/317-1
01:05:32.619 --> 01:05:37.179
<v Josh Sparkes>or is that no no.
But I suppose I mean this conversation</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/317-2
01:05:37.179 --> 01:05:42.859
<v Josh Sparkes>because but I think normally touching up
on assignment groups is that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/318-0
01:05:43.299 --> 01:05:46.227
<v Josh Sparkes>For those that they land in the two
different teams,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/318-1
01:05:46.227 --> 01:05:50.703
<v Josh Sparkes>you have those and there's probably a
third that we'll go through all day. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/318-2
01:05:50.703 --> 01:05:54.737
<v Josh Sparkes>I know that. You're just notes,
whether that's UK and Oz representation.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/318-3
01:05:54.737 --> 01:05:58.219
<v Josh Sparkes>So does it get inside all that that
proves new peer processes?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/319-0
01:05:58.499 --> 01:06:03.216
<v Josh Sparkes>The same global yes, yes.
So can it land well? If it is the same,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/319-1
01:06:03.216 --> 01:06:08.219
<v Josh Sparkes>we presented those three assignment
groups and actually paid by them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/319-2
01:06:08.219 --> 01:06:13.007
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not like, Oh my gosh,
because it was this only they can do it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/319-3
01:06:13.007 --> 01:06:17.939
<v Josh Sparkes>or should it land land with the Rama
global assignment group I mean.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/320-0
01:06:18.059 --> 01:06:21.641
<v Josh Sparkes>And it applies to all,
and whoever's working on it's an</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/320-1
01:06:21.641 --> 01:06:25.736
<v Josh Sparkes>assignment for themselves. Yeah,
it's one of those, like, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/320-2
01:06:25.736 --> 01:06:30.022
<v Josh Sparkes>Anybody can. That's anybody can do it.
Yes. Yeah. It's one of the.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/320-3
01:06:30.022 --> 01:06:34.692
<v Josh Sparkes>When you get a new joiner and it's one of
the first tasks that the tour.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/320-4
01:06:34.692 --> 01:06:37.379
<v Josh Sparkes>So anybody in any location can do it? Yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/321-0
01:06:37.819 --> 01:06:41.479
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, at any level in,
in education not assigned.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/321-1
01:06:41.479 --> 01:06:46.676
<v Josh Sparkes>So if it's a particular VIP client,
it's other than those skill matrix</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/321-2
01:06:46.676 --> 01:06:52.459
<v Josh Sparkes>associated with it. It's not when it's in,
it's assigned and you can see that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/322-0
01:06:53.139 --> 01:06:56.717
<v Josh Sparkes>If if it has been all eager in the
morning, you can assign,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/322-1
01:06:56.717 --> 01:07:01.429
<v Josh Sparkes>there might be 10 say or something.
You could just assign them one each or do,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/322-2
01:07:01.429 --> 01:07:05.663
<v Josh Sparkes>but it can also be reassigned.
It's not set in stone that reassignment</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/322-3
01:07:05.663 --> 01:07:09.480
<v Josh Sparkes>can happen, yes. Yeah.
And even the person that's been assigned</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/322-4
01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:09.659
<v Josh Sparkes>it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/323-0
01:07:11.499 --> 01:07:13.828
<v Josh Sparkes>I think sometimes you want to prevent
that,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/323-1
01:07:13.828 --> 01:07:17.533
<v Josh Sparkes>but in a team it could be actually can I
reassign it to someone else?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/323-2
01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:21.767
<v Josh Sparkes>As long as that person is not constantly
reassigning their work and they end up</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/323-3
01:07:21.767 --> 01:07:24.837
<v Josh Sparkes>with no tickets.
But you can monitor that traffic if it's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/323-4
01:07:24.837 --> 01:07:27.219
<v Josh Sparkes>assigned or reassigned all those
directions.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/324-0
01:07:28.219 --> 01:07:30.861
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
it's been certainly a rather global</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/324-1
01:07:30.861 --> 01:07:34.069
<v Josh Sparkes>assignment.
Briefly in the corporate and is that a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/324-2
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:39.039
<v Josh Sparkes>general theme as we go through things or
we can get into rates and matter that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/324-3
01:07:39.039 --> 01:07:42.939
<v Josh Sparkes>might be, yeah, that's double basically.
OK. OK, that's good.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/325-0
01:07:43.979 --> 01:07:48.790
<v Josh Sparkes>So anything else from the managing
replies, I think we had,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/325-1
01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:53.842
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean there's new PR,
new player then I mean maybe rate query</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/325-2
01:07:53.842 --> 01:08:00.017
<v Josh Sparkes>probably comes under our managing rates.
So we can maybe just change the new</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/325-3
01:08:00.017 --> 01:08:00.579
<v Josh Sparkes>player.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/326-0
01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:06.299
<v Josh Sparkes>Manage rates and trades building the
whole science topic it in itself.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/327-0
01:08:09.459 --> 01:08:13.697
<v Josh Sparkes>Great. Sorry. She should be so yeah,
that would be great.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/327-1
01:08:13.697 --> 01:08:17.716
<v Josh Sparkes>And then and then rates,
that's a panel agreement now.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/327-2
01:08:17.716 --> 01:08:22.393
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that done it fine.
They've always got done at rates managing</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/327-3
01:08:22.393 --> 01:08:25.755
<v Josh Sparkes>rates.
If you capture that as the story under</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/327-4
01:08:25.755 --> 01:08:28.459
<v Josh Sparkes>rates that probably I think it would.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/328-0
01:08:28.579 --> 01:08:34.372
<v Josh Sparkes>There will be rates. Yeah. OK.
Maybe just maybe that is the client's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/328-1
01:08:34.372 --> 01:08:40.417
<v Josh Sparkes>queries that you handled or is there
anything else that comes on right?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/328-2
01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:45.539
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've discussed from you,
but there's something up there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/329-0
01:08:47.339 --> 01:08:52.345
<v Josh Sparkes>New parents? Which one? Sorry.
The audience. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/329-1
01:08:52.345 --> 01:09:00.394
<v Josh Sparkes>I thought I've seen all parents client
updates, you know? Yeah. So that would be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/329-2
01:09:00.394 --> 01:09:02.259
<v Josh Sparkes>So you have bought.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/330-0
01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:08.258
<v Josh Sparkes>And forget about matters and you get
clients like the high level.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/330-1
01:09:08.258 --> 01:09:13.300
<v Josh Sparkes>And who then may be linked what we call
an ultimate client or a.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/330-2
01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:19.739
<v Josh Sparkes>So you have subsidiary of parents. Yes,
associate of several clients under a peep.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/331-0
01:09:20.299 --> 01:09:24.282
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, basically.
And they could be written incorrectly or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/331-1
01:09:24.282 --> 01:09:29.570
<v Josh Sparkes>the partner feels that they're written
incorrectly and it has to be changed.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/331-2
01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:34.377
<v Josh Sparkes>But before it gets changed,
our data management team would need to do</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/331-3
01:09:34.377 --> 01:09:38.979
<v Josh Sparkes>the relevant cheques to say yes,
it's OK to change that hierarchy.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/332-0
01:09:39.299 --> 01:09:44.625
<v Josh Sparkes>And if they do that, then we can.
Is that not your responsibility of a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/332-1
01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:49.802
<v Josh Sparkes>subsidiary to parent responsibility?
Is that compliance again or no,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/332-2
01:09:49.802 --> 01:09:53.928
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not compliance.
It would be data managing myself.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/332-3
01:09:53.928 --> 01:09:57.979
<v Josh Sparkes>So they they want a change.
So they request a change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/333-0
01:09:59.579 --> 01:10:02.566
<v Josh Sparkes>We would then,
if it hasn't touched the vast data</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/333-1
01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:05.972
<v Josh Sparkes>management team,
we would then ask data management to do</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/333-2
01:10:05.972 --> 01:10:10.871
<v Josh Sparkes>the relevant cheques to see that that we
can change just like compliance with the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/333-3
01:10:10.871 --> 01:10:13.739
<v Josh Sparkes>data management team.
So they do their cheques.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/334-0
01:10:14.459 --> 01:10:18.365
<v Josh Sparkes>Or alternatively data management,
the request went to them originally.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/334-1
01:10:18.365 --> 01:10:22.656
<v Josh Sparkes>They've already done their cheques and
they will send the request through and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/334-2
01:10:22.656 --> 01:10:25.242
<v Josh Sparkes>ask us to update.
And how did that come about?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/334-3
01:10:25.242 --> 01:10:29.699
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that did that come about by a trigger
initially from a race and matter issue?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/335-0
01:10:30.779 --> 01:10:35.293
<v Josh Sparkes>No, it's generally well, it's.
It's generally to do with reporting,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/335-1
01:10:35.293 --> 01:10:38.877
<v Josh Sparkes>to be honest.
So when the partner is one step reports</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/335-2
01:10:38.877 --> 01:10:42.395
<v Josh Sparkes>and they may be missing some clients in
that report,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/335-3
01:10:42.395 --> 01:10:46.179
<v Josh Sparkes>they feel that that client number should
be in there or.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/336-0
01:10:47.339 --> 01:10:51.088
<v Josh Sparkes>Or they feel that there's a client number
in there that shouldn't be in there. Yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/336-1
01:10:51.088 --> 01:10:53.097
<v Josh Sparkes>it's.
I'm just thinking this is one of those</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/336-2
01:10:53.097 --> 01:10:53.499
<v Josh Sparkes>reactive.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/337-0
01:10:54.779 --> 01:10:57.421
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, no,
it is generally more to do with important</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/337-1
01:10:57.421 --> 01:11:00.317
<v Josh Sparkes>purposes. Yeah.
So it's figures that were important sort</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/337-2
01:11:00.317 --> 01:11:03.518
<v Josh Sparkes>of picked up and reporting.
I wonder how it could be corrected</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/337-3
01:11:03.518 --> 01:11:06.110
<v Josh Sparkes>upstream,
but I mean probably the question was why</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/337-4
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:10.378
<v Josh Sparkes>was it, why were they incorrectly rooted?
That's probably again love years. And so,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/337-5
01:11:10.378 --> 01:11:12.817
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
I'm maybe I'll pose the question now is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/337-6
01:11:12.817 --> 01:11:13.579
<v Josh Sparkes>why they would.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/338-0
01:11:13.859 --> 01:11:17.591
<v Josh Sparkes>Incorrectly rooted anyway in the first
person that may not be,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/338-1
01:11:17.591 --> 01:11:22.270
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not something that our team would do
so at that sits with the management.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/338-2
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:24.877
<v Josh Sparkes>So when it's first created date
management,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/338-3
01:11:24.877 --> 01:11:29.260
<v Josh Sparkes>do their cheques and there is various
reasons I'm sure data manager went.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/338-4
01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:32.459
<v Josh Sparkes>There's various reasons why it's rooted
at that time.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/340-0
01:11:33.619 --> 01:11:37.162
<v Josh Sparkes>In addition, some days for work next week.
Yeah, we do. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/340-1
01:11:37.162 --> 01:11:41.047
<v Josh Sparkes>we can pick that up again and go,
actually not screen. In addition,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/340-2
01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:45.447
<v Josh Sparkes>even when data management do their
cheques, they will look and see actually,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/340-3
01:11:45.447 --> 01:11:48.876
<v Josh Sparkes>no, that shouldn't.
The partner can still override that for</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/340-4
01:11:48.876 --> 01:11:51.847
<v Josh Sparkes>important.
And even though it's considered complete</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/340-5
01:11:51.847 --> 01:11:53.219
<v Josh Sparkes>and correct at the time.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/341-0
01:11:53.619 --> 01:11:56.952
<v Josh Sparkes>We sent an amendment to it. Yes,
for whatever reason. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/341-1
01:11:56.952 --> 01:12:00.064
<v Josh Sparkes>So that we can't just wouldn't do that.
We need to. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/341-2
01:12:00.064 --> 01:12:04.620
<v Josh Sparkes>That query comes into you from you would
raise it's data management can raise it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/341-3
01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:07.954
<v Josh Sparkes>It's management.
More to ask is to to make the changes. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/341-4
01:12:07.954 --> 01:12:11.954
<v Josh Sparkes>Because they've already done that.
But we could also get a request from</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/341-5
01:12:11.954 --> 01:12:12.899
<v Josh Sparkes>you're a partner.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/342-0
01:12:14.259 --> 01:12:16.824
<v Josh Sparkes>Not often.
It's usually from data management,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/342-1
01:12:16.824 --> 01:12:21.006
<v Josh Sparkes>but we can't get requests from there,
but we wouldn't change that until we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/342-2
01:12:21.006 --> 01:12:25.077
<v Josh Sparkes>checked with data management so.
So if you look at the as is the partner</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/342-3
01:12:25.077 --> 01:12:28.813
<v Josh Sparkes>and then it tells the PU yeah,
and the P on behalf of the partners</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/342-4
01:12:28.813 --> 01:12:32.550
<v Josh Sparkes>health data management and data
management tells you so there's an</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/342-5
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:33.219
<v Josh Sparkes>opportunity.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/343-0
01:12:33.299 --> 01:12:37.319
<v Josh Sparkes>See that?
Actually they do chips or the PE could</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/343-1
01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:42.487
<v Josh Sparkes>raise a query directly, you know,
because they've wanted data.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/343-2
01:12:42.487 --> 01:12:46.343
<v Josh Sparkes>But there are a few lots doing the work.
Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/343-3
01:12:46.343 --> 01:12:51.019
<v Josh Sparkes>And I think the question just come from
data management.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/344-0
01:12:51.299 --> 01:12:53.960
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
because they need to do their cheques.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/344-1
01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.798
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
So they they do the check,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/344-2
01:12:56.798 --> 01:13:00.228
<v Josh Sparkes>but you do the change,
they they do some changes and on a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/344-3
01:13:00.228 --> 01:13:02.830
<v Josh Sparkes>different application.
But then within 3 E,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/344-4
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:06.438
<v Josh Sparkes>the team does changes. OK,
so you need the request that says</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/344-5
01:13:06.438 --> 01:13:09.099
<v Josh Sparkes>amendment to the parent clients.
Are you OK?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/345-0
01:13:09.739 --> 01:13:13.150
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so it could come in your query means</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/345-1
01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:19.972
<v Josh Sparkes>service and then you've got the requestor
for on behalf of your partner on behalf</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/345-2
01:13:19.972 --> 01:13:26.379
<v Josh Sparkes>of and then what you do then you go in
three E same thing we're going to do.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/346-0
01:13:26.499 --> 01:13:30.722
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the changes in three east and
then back to the ticket to see this has</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/346-1
01:13:30.722 --> 01:13:33.716
<v Josh Sparkes>been updated.
And then just resource OK then and that's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/346-2
01:13:33.716 --> 01:13:37.726
<v Josh Sparkes>there's no push back on that once you
have received that that's assumed as</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/346-3
01:13:37.726 --> 01:13:40.346
<v Josh Sparkes>approval from assumed approval from the
partner,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/346-4
01:13:40.346 --> 01:13:42.859
<v Josh Sparkes>you don't need to get another set of
approval.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/347-0
01:13:43.779 --> 01:13:47.757
<v Josh Sparkes>And then you go through and maybe also
it's now that could be formalised that we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/347-1
01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:51.735
<v Josh Sparkes>changed you know capturing those changes
within those way past work notes maybe.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/347-2
01:13:51.735 --> 01:13:53.945
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean I don't want to give the over
family,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/347-3
01:13:53.945 --> 01:13:56.499
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the management should be doing
all of that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/348-0
01:14:01.379 --> 01:14:04.846
<v Josh Sparkes>Management,
I don't see why they can't do the the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/348-1
01:14:04.846 --> 01:14:08.245
<v Josh Sparkes>whole process,
so maybe that's something we can.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/348-2
01:14:08.245 --> 01:14:13.585
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a process that doesn't get that
comes out of Wellness in queue. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/348-3
01:14:13.585 --> 01:14:18.579
<v Josh Sparkes>And we'll discuss it with a for next week.
Yeah, it's more responsible.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/349-0
01:14:18.619 --> 01:14:18.779
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/350-0
01:14:21.979 --> 01:14:25.949
<v Josh Sparkes>Sure. OK.
Because they're presumably having to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/350-1
01:14:25.949 --> 01:14:30.830
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, finalise. It's it it.
It started initiated problems,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/350-2
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:36.207
<v Josh Sparkes>but they could own the whole post with
that. And how much? Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/350-3
01:14:36.207 --> 01:14:37.779
<v Josh Sparkes>conversations with.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/351-0
01:14:38.859 --> 01:14:47.380
<v Josh Sparkes>And they're accepting about some of these.
I think it's just their responsibilities</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/351-1
01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:52.655
<v Josh Sparkes>to yeah,
as it's just been traditionally that it's,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/351-2
01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:55.699
<v Josh Sparkes>I think, you know, we because.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/352-0
01:14:56.219 --> 01:15:00.890
<v Josh Sparkes>That team used to sit with Geraldine as
well until last year, so oh, OK. Oh,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/352-1
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:05.258
<v Josh Sparkes>I see that sits with an ask as well.
So we can definitely put it in the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/352-2
01:15:05.258 --> 01:15:10.051
<v Josh Sparkes>service. Kind of. OK. Yeah, that's good.
OK. So we part that forward. Yep. OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/352-3
01:15:10.051 --> 01:15:10.779
<v Josh Sparkes>so that one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/353-0
01:15:14.939 --> 01:15:18.862
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
and the PR and the pale query rate will</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/353-1
01:15:18.862 --> 01:15:23.809
<v Josh Sparkes>cover new master rates.
So I can just change that. Sorry,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/353-2
01:15:23.809 --> 01:15:25.259
<v Josh Sparkes>this one as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/354-0
01:15:26.819 --> 01:15:27.059
<v Josh Sparkes>Umm.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/355-0
01:15:28.659 --> 01:15:30.019
<v Josh Sparkes>Two rights.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/356-0
01:15:32.619 --> 01:15:38.399
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've got nothing here that's probably
on the matter of our management actually.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/356-1
01:15:38.399 --> 01:15:43.217
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I think everybody's advice and yeah,
all matter actually, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/356-2
01:15:43.217 --> 01:15:47.827
<v Josh Sparkes>Some manage matter that. Yeah,
and manage that's that's great. Oh,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/356-3
01:15:47.827 --> 01:15:51.819
<v Josh Sparkes>that'll be right. Chair. We've got one.
Great. Thank you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/357-0
01:15:54.259 --> 01:16:00.945
<v Josh Sparkes>Refresh on client,
just make sure we've covered everything</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/357-1
01:16:00.945 --> 01:16:02.419
<v Josh Sparkes>as well. Yep.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/358-0
01:16:07.579 --> 01:16:10.380
<v Josh Sparkes>I got that question.
Sorry I don't look weird.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/358-1
01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:15.147
<v Josh Sparkes>I give you a mic. Is that right? Sorry.
It's just I was questioning whether you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/358-2
01:16:15.147 --> 01:16:19.259
<v Josh Sparkes>guys create a client interview manually.
If it's unavailable in NBI.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/359-0
01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:28.527
<v Josh Sparkes>Nicely we do,
but I have been the team for a year and a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/359-1
01:16:28.527 --> 01:16:34.448
<v Josh Sparkes>bit and we've never done it,
but it's in our processes. Yes, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/359-2
01:16:34.448 --> 01:16:40.899
<v Josh Sparkes>Does it need to? Yeah. Doesn't need to be.
I'm just questioning if it's.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/360-0
01:16:41.939 --> 01:16:45.000
<v Josh Sparkes>Well, I don't.
I'm assuming it's there for the reason</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/360-1
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.649
<v Josh Sparkes>I've seen the process in the process maps.
We've never done it since I've been in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/360-2
01:16:49.649 --> 01:16:52.484
<v Josh Sparkes>the team,
but I'm aware that we may have to do it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/360-3
01:16:52.484 --> 01:16:56.339
<v Josh Sparkes>at one point and it would have to be a
request. Well, if you heard.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/361-0
01:16:56.939 --> 01:16:59.975
<v Josh Sparkes>Talk and seek.
That thing came up right and you were to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/361-1
01:16:59.975 --> 01:17:02.903
<v Josh Sparkes>create that request.
How would it come into the team?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/361-2
01:17:02.903 --> 01:17:06.645
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm assuming it would just be like a
request from compliance, right?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/361-3
01:17:06.645 --> 01:17:10.440
<v Josh Sparkes>So just an e-mail. And yeah,
saying can you create this client? Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/361-4
01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:14.019
<v Josh Sparkes>I'd like to be part of a general query
form rather than official.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/362-0
01:17:15.939 --> 01:17:19.825
<v Josh Sparkes>Does it sit with any with nails?
Is it is that like a stand alone</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/362-1
01:17:19.825 --> 01:17:24.064
<v Josh Sparkes>Geraldine like they all right to come
under manage client aspect? Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/362-2
01:17:24.064 --> 01:17:27.832
<v Josh Sparkes>it still be part of that?
Could it be like so for example if we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/362-3
01:17:27.832 --> 01:17:31.659
<v Josh Sparkes>create a form for a managed client
request then there's certain.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/363-0
01:17:32.099 --> 01:17:36.239
<v Josh Sparkes>Information that we put on that,
could it be an optional being a bit</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/363-1
01:17:36.239 --> 01:17:38.879
<v Josh Sparkes>created or would you not want to open
that?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/363-2
01:17:38.879 --> 01:17:43.679
<v Josh Sparkes>Can I look into that a little bit more?
I I don't want to give an answer that I</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/363-3
01:17:43.679 --> 01:17:48.419
<v Josh Sparkes>don't know the answer to. To the list,
I'd have to look at the process and see</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/363-4
01:17:48.419 --> 01:17:51.539
<v Josh Sparkes>how that comes just because I've never
had had one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/364-0
01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:53.379
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/365-0
01:17:56.179 --> 01:17:59.019
<v Josh Sparkes>But still we potentially manage patterns
of those.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/366-0
01:18:01.179 --> 01:18:05.299
<v Josh Sparkes>A few of them. I've never seen one.
I've never seen one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/367-0
01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:11.259
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Thank you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/368-0
01:18:14.619 --> 01:18:19.509
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Should we go to manage person? Yeah,
I think it's a whole 20.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/368-1
01:18:19.509 --> 01:18:24.030
<v Josh Sparkes>Half your processes,
but some of it's already covered. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/368-2
01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:27.809
<v Josh Sparkes>exactly.
So some of it is covered and I think that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/368-3
01:18:27.809 --> 01:18:30.699
<v Josh Sparkes>the beauty of it. I mean, there's lots.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/369-0
01:18:31.939 --> 01:18:36.382
<v Josh Sparkes>You read through them, you think is that?
Is that a, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/369-1
01:18:36.382 --> 01:18:39.908
<v Josh Sparkes>slight subtlety of that one that's like
subtlety.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/369-2
01:18:39.908 --> 01:18:45.126
<v Josh Sparkes>And I haven't again trivialised it
because I think it's a whole slide for</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/369-3
01:18:45.126 --> 01:18:46.819
<v Josh Sparkes>yourself. Yeah, key for.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/370-0
01:18:47.859 --> 01:18:50.742
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
you know the the rights rates that's been</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/370-1
01:18:50.742 --> 01:18:55.068
<v Josh Sparkes>implied, billed for, etcetera.
So I don't know whether there is a happy</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/370-2
01:18:55.068 --> 01:18:59.934
<v Josh Sparkes>path that we spell that's just starting a
lot more. Yeah. Yeah, I'm quite happy.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/370-3
01:18:59.934 --> 01:19:04.019
<v Josh Sparkes>So what notification is exactly the same
process as the client one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/371-0
01:19:04.459 --> 01:19:09.884
<v Josh Sparkes>And except to do that matter level, OK,
so it's that same thing. It's threshold.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/371-1
01:19:09.884 --> 01:19:13.970
<v Josh Sparkes>But there's a budget in there and they
are either asking us,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/371-2
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:17.453
<v Josh Sparkes>they want to receive notifications that
is hitting,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/371-3
01:19:17.453 --> 01:19:22.946
<v Josh Sparkes>it's getting their weekly notifications
or they're not paid up with them and they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/371-4
01:19:22.946 --> 01:19:24.219
<v Josh Sparkes>want them all. Yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/372-0
01:19:24.419 --> 01:19:29.091
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. OK, that's easy. OK,
good matter link.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/372-1
01:19:29.091 --> 01:19:36.775
<v Josh Sparkes>So the is a matter already existing
matter number 123 and the one another</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/372-2
01:19:36.775 --> 01:19:39.579
<v Josh Sparkes>matter that's been created.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/373-0
01:19:40.339 --> 01:19:45.243
<v Josh Sparkes>2344 lines. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And they want them linked.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/373-1
01:19:45.243 --> 01:19:51.953
<v Josh Sparkes>But the one of them will be a primary
matter. One will be a secondary matter.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/373-2
01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:55.739
<v Josh Sparkes>And the so you you go in and you link
them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/374-0
01:19:56.779 --> 01:20:00.828
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the on the primary,
that's there'll be the building part of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/374-1
01:20:00.828 --> 01:20:04.409
<v Josh Sparkes>it. But we do all that in three years.
So the Canary matter,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/374-2
01:20:04.409 --> 01:20:09.339
<v Josh Sparkes>there'll be the one that's built for both
of them and the secondary matter wouldn't</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/374-3
01:20:09.339 --> 01:20:11.804
<v Josh Sparkes>be built.
So it's just stuff we do in the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/374-4
01:20:11.804 --> 01:20:15.619
<v Josh Sparkes>background within three,
but we're linking them, so I repressed.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/375-0
01:20:15.819 --> 01:20:20.113
<v Josh Sparkes>Come through.
Can you link this matter so we do what we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/375-1
01:20:20.113 --> 01:20:25.327
<v Josh Sparkes>need to do in three East and we also
check currency and grades. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/375-2
01:20:25.327 --> 01:20:29.468
<v Josh Sparkes>So then just my own understanding.
So you would have,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/375-3
01:20:29.468 --> 01:20:31.539
<v Josh Sparkes>you know a client's matter.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/376-0
01:20:31.979 --> 01:20:35.229
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
honestly and these are your per diem or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/376-1
01:20:35.229 --> 01:20:40.234
<v Josh Sparkes>per hour or whether I think the better
deems or are they hourly rates? Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/376-2
01:20:40.234 --> 01:20:43.874
<v Josh Sparkes>hourly or yeah.
So hourly for the different hierarchies</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/376-3
01:20:43.874 --> 01:20:47.189
<v Josh Sparkes>of roles.
And you're saying that your prime always</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/376-4
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:51.739
<v Josh Sparkes>assume if there's one that's your primary
and then all your billable.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/377-0
01:20:52.139 --> 01:20:55.792
<v Josh Sparkes>So you're primarily always available,
is that correct? Yes, yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/377-1
01:20:55.792 --> 01:21:00.064
<v Josh Sparkes>So you could see your matter what?
No matter two matter one is going to get</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/377-2
01:21:00.064 --> 01:21:03.605
<v Josh Sparkes>built or both matters matter.
Two is never going to get built.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/377-3
01:21:03.605 --> 01:21:07.315
<v Josh Sparkes>Anything that's any work,
it's done in Matter 2 will be built to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/377-4
01:21:07.315 --> 01:21:10.799
<v Josh Sparkes>And so just tell me why matter 2.
Is that because there's the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/377-5
01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:11.699
<v Josh Sparkes>differentiation?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/378-0
01:21:12.179 --> 01:21:18.029
<v Josh Sparkes>Or it's just that it is a separate.
It's different. Yeah, it's just the one,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/378-1
01:21:18.029 --> 01:21:23.728
<v Josh Sparkes>the one that links for some reason.
And the client is just once bundle for</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/378-2
01:21:23.728 --> 01:21:28.059
<v Josh Sparkes>both my and. That's what. Yeah.
So we just we link them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/379-0
01:21:28.619 --> 01:21:31.683
<v Josh Sparkes>It means one bills.
There's one bill for their the secondary</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/379-1
01:21:31.683 --> 01:21:35.049
<v Josh Sparkes>matter won't get billed,
and we just check do like cheques because</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/379-2
01:21:35.049 --> 01:21:37.862
<v Josh Sparkes>one of the matters, maybe U.S. dollars,
one, maybe EUR.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/379-3
01:21:37.862 --> 01:21:41.881
<v Josh Sparkes>So we need to make them aware of that.
And then generally they'll come back and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/379-4
01:21:41.881 --> 01:21:44.493
<v Josh Sparkes>ask us to change the currency as well or
we'll see.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/379-5
01:21:44.493 --> 01:21:47.859
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got local rates than that one.
And you've got international.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/381-0
01:21:48.139 --> 01:21:51.880
<v Josh Sparkes>In that one or what works.
So we just saw that aligned with.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/381-1
01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.314
<v Josh Sparkes>So the base work you know we triggered
that to you MPs,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/381-2
01:21:55.314 --> 01:21:59.913
<v Josh Sparkes>sorry I was just going to ask so see
those kind of things the anomalies or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/381-3
01:21:59.913 --> 01:22:05.064
<v Josh Sparkes>different things that you need to look at,
can any of that be standardised up front</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/381-4
01:22:05.064 --> 01:22:07.579
<v Josh Sparkes>so that you can provide that information?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/382-0
01:22:07.659 --> 01:22:08.059
<v Josh Sparkes>Information.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/383-0
01:22:09.299 --> 01:22:13.895
<v Josh Sparkes>Or is it not until you go in and look at
each matter that you know what it may be?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/383-1
01:22:13.895 --> 01:22:17.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it quite dynamic? Yeah.
You have to look into the matter because</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/383-2
01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:21.758
<v Josh Sparkes>quite often they don't know that one
matters pounds and the other matters</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/383-3
01:22:21.758 --> 01:22:25.302
<v Josh Sparkes>rules. So you have to do,
I think if there's any way we can cut</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/383-4
01:22:25.302 --> 01:22:28.459
<v Josh Sparkes>down the you have to do it through the
cheques in three.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/384-0
01:22:28.779 --> 01:22:32.770
<v Josh Sparkes>You make them aware of that.
That's what it is. Yeah. You know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/384-1
01:22:32.770 --> 01:22:37.259
<v Josh Sparkes>the link is that they want to link.
Something would say I want to link,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/384-2
01:22:37.259 --> 01:22:40.440
<v Josh Sparkes>and that's in the request of the partner,
whoever.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/384-3
01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:45.179
<v Josh Sparkes>And that part standardising is that we're
linking it and we always do 100%.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/385-0
01:22:45.499 --> 01:22:50.679
<v Josh Sparkes>And the bill will go to the primary
matter and then change it to 0% for the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/385-1
01:22:50.679 --> 01:22:53.679
<v Josh Sparkes>2nd.
So that's then that's that's just what</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/385-2
01:22:53.679 --> 01:22:57.019
<v Josh Sparkes>happens.
But when we just go back and tell them,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/385-3
01:22:57.019 --> 01:23:01.859
<v Josh Sparkes>do you know that one's pound,
that one's EUR or three ease capability?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/386-0
01:23:02.619 --> 01:23:06.705
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it always? I mean,
I don't think you have a third or fourth</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/386-1
01:23:06.705 --> 01:23:10.920
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe or you might be linking 1 to.
Is it something maybe three?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/386-2
01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:16.109
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it always the case that if there is a
second match it always leads to number</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/386-3
01:23:16.109 --> 01:23:19.546
<v Josh Sparkes>one or no?
That is just a request that you're doing?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/386-4
01:23:19.546 --> 01:23:20.779
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just, I'm just.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/387-0
01:23:21.779 --> 01:23:26.607
<v Josh Sparkes>Tell us they'll just say can you link
that matter to that matter and that that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/387-1
01:23:26.607 --> 01:23:31.436
<v Josh Sparkes>matter number should be the primary? OK,
doesn't matter when they were set up,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/387-2
01:23:31.436 --> 01:23:35.897
<v Josh Sparkes>they'll they'll just tell us which one
has to be the primary matter. OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/387-3
01:23:35.897 --> 01:23:37.059
<v Josh Sparkes>basically. So they.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/388-0
01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:37.819
<v Josh Sparkes>Umm.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/389-0
01:23:39.419 --> 01:23:44.150
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like a question service.
Now as you said, it could be that they're,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/389-1
01:23:44.150 --> 01:23:48.622
<v Josh Sparkes>you know request the link.
It's not that they can do obviously these</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/389-2
01:23:48.622 --> 01:23:51.603
<v Josh Sparkes>no,
they can't do that and then it comes into</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/389-3
01:23:51.603 --> 01:23:54.779
<v Josh Sparkes>you and they'll say it's you know all
we'll say.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/390-0
01:23:55.019 --> 01:23:59.614
<v Josh Sparkes>Which clients? And that's a wonderful.
It's literally you can be like this</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/390-1
01:23:59.614 --> 01:24:03.475
<v Josh Sparkes>master number to that,
but the information we do need is which</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/390-2
01:24:03.475 --> 01:24:06.784
<v Josh Sparkes>they often forget is which one's the
primary exactly.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/390-3
01:24:06.784 --> 01:24:11.257
<v Josh Sparkes>It's significant from reading questions.
Yeah. And, you know, education.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/390-4
01:24:11.257 --> 01:24:12.299
<v Josh Sparkes>And at that pace.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/391-0
01:24:13.579 --> 01:24:17.373
<v Josh Sparkes>That they've got them the right way round.
Just that quickly.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/391-1
01:24:17.373 --> 01:24:21.780
<v Josh Sparkes>See that when you create the matter and
then tap at the original point,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/391-2
01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:25.452
<v Josh Sparkes>is there a create?
Is there a point at that really can link</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/391-3
01:24:25.452 --> 01:24:30.592
<v Josh Sparkes>them and see this is a sub point or is it
just quite often when it comes to billing</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/391-4
01:24:30.592 --> 01:24:31.939
<v Josh Sparkes>you do the like, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/392-0
01:24:32.339 --> 01:24:36.488
<v Josh Sparkes>No, we'd have to do the one later on,
because quite often they've not been set</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/392-1
01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:40.111
<v Josh Sparkes>up at the same time anyway,
so the original one is generally the one</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/392-2
01:24:40.111 --> 01:24:44.260
<v Josh Sparkes>that would want primary general. I'm just,
but obviously we need to open a new</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/392-3
01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:47.779
<v Josh Sparkes>matter. I just want to defend.
Tab has the ability to say this is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/393-0
01:24:48.499 --> 01:24:50.499
<v Josh Sparkes>A sub of a previous one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/394-0
01:24:52.219 --> 01:24:55.585
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know. I'll.
I'll take it as a question to I don't.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/394-1
01:24:55.585 --> 01:24:58.951
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, obviously when they're,
I don't know, I think not.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/394-2
01:24:58.951 --> 01:25:03.059
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we just set up the matter as is
and then when it gets to three,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/394-3
01:25:03.059 --> 01:25:06.539
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got the availability to change it
primary, secondary.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/395-0
01:25:08.659 --> 01:25:13.838
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Yeah, OK. I've got that actually. OK,
so you get the query. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/395-1
01:25:13.838 --> 01:25:18.129
<v Josh Sparkes>coming into link.
So do they need pre approval to request</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/395-2
01:25:18.129 --> 01:25:22.421
<v Josh Sparkes>that or is that no,
we just at the request that we assume</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/395-3
01:25:22.421 --> 01:25:22.939
<v Josh Sparkes>that's.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/396-0
01:25:23.499 --> 01:25:27.603
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can give them some leaving quick.
Sorry. So just quick one,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/396-1
01:25:27.603 --> 01:25:30.899
<v Josh Sparkes>do they ever want to reverse that so you
can unlink?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/397-0
01:25:37.019 --> 01:25:40.679
<v Josh Sparkes>Essentially, we could.
I'm not aware of it ever happening,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/397-1
01:25:40.679 --> 01:25:44.339
<v Josh Sparkes>but potentially we could and we can do it.
It's not. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/397-2
01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:47.379
<v Josh Sparkes>it's literally just reversing what you're
doing.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/398-0
01:25:47.859 --> 01:25:52.828
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, you don't get don't tend to,
but it could be a request. Yeah. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/398-1
01:25:52.828 --> 01:25:56.900
<v Josh Sparkes>So it, as you said,
leaving questions that you're linking,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/398-2
01:25:56.900 --> 01:26:02.076
<v Josh Sparkes>it's one to primary or one to the
information we've been really interested</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/398-3
01:26:02.076 --> 01:26:07.459
<v Josh Sparkes>is obviously we need both matter numbers
and we need which one's the primary.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/399-0
01:26:07.779 --> 01:26:13.156
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what we'd like to have offering,
OK. And the massive numbers, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/399-1
01:26:13.156 --> 01:26:17.581
<v Josh Sparkes>instead of them putting TVC,
we could there could be some logic.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/399-2
01:26:17.581 --> 01:26:22.005
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, have a good people of all that.
Yeah, there is a format.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/399-3
01:26:22.005 --> 01:26:27.179
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's usually 4 numbers, then 3,
then three. But they know that but yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/400-0
01:26:27.259 --> 01:26:32.398
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just saying that instead of the
writing TBC on the form you're capturing,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/400-1
01:26:32.398 --> 01:26:37.734
<v Josh Sparkes>that's, you know, it's a sort of a yeah,
it's much information to make your life</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/400-2
01:26:37.734 --> 01:26:42.939
<v Josh Sparkes>of the admin so they can enter that on
the form with some validations on these</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/400-3
01:26:42.939 --> 01:26:45.179
<v Josh Sparkes>four numbers, linking it once too.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/401-0
01:26:45.539 --> 01:26:50.618
<v Josh Sparkes>And then it lands with yourself.
And then again we link it to what we need</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/401-1
01:26:50.618 --> 01:26:55.764
<v Josh Sparkes>to do and then just go back. See,
that's OK any reason why you might not do</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/401-2
01:26:55.764 --> 01:27:00.369
<v Josh Sparkes>it or no, no, it's not just.
And when you go in to find things that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/401-3
01:27:00.369 --> 01:27:00.979
<v Josh Sparkes>actually.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/402-0
01:27:01.859 --> 01:27:05.535
<v Josh Sparkes>That number doesn't exist,
that there wasn't a second matter.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/402-1
01:27:05.535 --> 01:27:10.220
<v Josh Sparkes>There isn't all tally. It's pretty good.
Yes, I've already checked. Have they?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/402-2
01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:14.786
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, that could be a question.
Have you checked that? They're both? Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/402-3
01:27:14.786 --> 01:27:18.107
<v Josh Sparkes>they're active, for example,
or I've never came across.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/402-4
01:27:18.107 --> 01:27:20.539
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's always simple. Yes, you know the.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/403-0
01:27:22.099 --> 01:27:24.957
<v Josh Sparkes>Should provide which one's the primary.
We do a bit.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/403-1
01:27:24.957 --> 01:27:28.570
<v Josh Sparkes>Then we just go back and let them know if
there's any differences.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/403-2
01:27:28.570 --> 01:27:31.158
<v Josh Sparkes>We can we see in regards to currency
rates, OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/403-3
01:27:31.158 --> 01:27:34.501
<v Josh Sparkes>So you could capture on that form that
you're in service now,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/403-4
01:27:34.501 --> 01:27:38.384
<v Josh Sparkes>but there was a difference in currency
and do you correct that then no,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/403-5
01:27:38.384 --> 01:27:40.379
<v Josh Sparkes>since I might not want to change, OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/404-0
01:27:40.619 --> 01:27:42.860
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah,
reports there was difference in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/404-1
01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:46.632
<v Josh Sparkes>currencies and then captured either one
here. Any other differences?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/404-2
01:27:46.632 --> 01:27:49.967
<v Josh Sparkes>The rates might be different as well and
due terms of rates,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/404-3
01:27:49.967 --> 01:27:53.903
<v Josh Sparkes>again they might not want it.
So we were just letting them know because</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/404-4
01:27:53.903 --> 01:27:58.276
<v Josh Sparkes>obviously followed down the line with the
company bill and they might go what's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/404-5
01:27:58.276 --> 01:28:00.299
<v Josh Sparkes>happening here. So it's just as seen.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/405-0
01:28:00.739 --> 01:28:03.586
<v Josh Sparkes>We've linked it, however,
just to make you aware,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/405-1
01:28:03.586 --> 01:28:07.116
<v Josh Sparkes>this one's EUR that one's pounds.
This one's got the streets,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/405-2
01:28:07.116 --> 01:28:10.248
<v Josh Sparkes>and this one's got bad streets.
So part of your notes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/405-3
01:28:10.248 --> 01:28:14.518
<v Josh Sparkes>because when you close complete,
the notification can go back to them with</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/405-4
01:28:14.518 --> 01:28:16.739
<v Josh Sparkes>the work notes of just a big, you know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/406-0
01:28:17.019 --> 01:28:21.570
<v Josh Sparkes>All your information? Yeah, that. Yeah,
that could be in there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/406-1
01:28:21.570 --> 01:28:24.678
<v Josh Sparkes>And it could be current. Some rates,
as you said. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/406-2
01:28:24.678 --> 01:28:29.228
<v Josh Sparkes>But you you just you don't put it on hold
and inform them and then do the change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/406-3
01:28:29.228 --> 01:28:33.391
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just the we just link it because
they will definitely want it linked.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/406-4
01:28:33.391 --> 01:28:36.110
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah and OK.
But they need come back and want to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/406-5
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:36.499
<v Josh Sparkes>change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/407-0
01:28:36.699 --> 01:28:40.697
<v Josh Sparkes>The currency of rates,
but the you won't want it not linked. OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/407-1
01:28:40.697 --> 01:28:45.619
<v Josh Sparkes>we're good. So what's work notes? Yeah,
even if what's our currencies match and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/407-2
01:28:45.619 --> 01:28:50.786
<v Josh Sparkes>rates match or don't match? Yeah, exactly.
And then you check what the notification</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/407-3
01:28:50.786 --> 01:28:53.739
<v Josh Sparkes>could be such that makes it a polite,
you know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/408-0
01:28:54.579 --> 01:28:58.099
<v Josh Sparkes>Please note the following.
These and these few things change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/408-1
01:28:58.099 --> 01:29:02.642
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe we can get some of the check box
from your list that potential things you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/408-2
01:29:02.642 --> 01:29:06.844
<v Josh Sparkes>can formalise that on the form. Yeah,
if that's helpful. Yeah. Geraldine,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/408-3
01:29:06.844 --> 01:29:09.683
<v Josh Sparkes>have you,
have you seen the interface service now</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/408-4
01:29:09.683 --> 01:29:10.819
<v Josh Sparkes>with the work notes?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/409-0
01:29:11.219 --> 01:29:14.951
<v Josh Sparkes>The employee and the operation side.
I've seen the game. Was it? Oh, OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/409-1
01:29:14.951 --> 01:29:18.325
<v Josh Sparkes>that's that's OK. Yeah,
I'll show you later if you want to have a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/409-2
01:29:18.325 --> 01:29:18.939
<v Josh Sparkes>closer look.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/410-0
01:29:20.179 --> 01:29:20.939
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's good.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/411-0
01:29:22.499 --> 01:29:27.586
<v Josh Sparkes>It was, yeah. Maybe unlink. Same with us.
So it could be so if they ask it to be on</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/411-1
01:29:27.586 --> 01:29:32.007
<v Josh Sparkes>the link again. So where we work,
we don't really want to know about the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/411-2
01:29:32.007 --> 01:29:35.095
<v Josh Sparkes>work that we do in 3D,
which you should have said.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/411-3
01:29:35.095 --> 01:29:37.821
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have to change it back to not
primary,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/411-4
01:29:37.821 --> 01:29:41.939
<v Josh Sparkes>not secondary and then change that they
both get billed separately.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/412-0
01:29:42.059 --> 01:29:46.220
<v Josh Sparkes>So it would be 100% and 100% on each
matter. So same thing. OK, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/412-1
01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:49.669
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you capture,
so you capture it could be when you're</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/412-2
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:54.187
<v Josh Sparkes>linking them, it's always a hundred,
100 or 101. So when when we link them,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/412-3
01:29:54.187 --> 01:29:58.706
<v Josh Sparkes>the primary one will be billed 100% for
both matters. So we have to change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/412-4
01:29:58.706 --> 01:30:01.619
<v Josh Sparkes>That's always the case, yes.
And then we change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/413-0
01:30:01.819 --> 01:30:06.850
<v Josh Sparkes>Secondary to 0, so they can't get bills.
So if we were to unlink it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/413-1
01:30:06.850 --> 01:30:12.684
<v Josh Sparkes>it would be 100 and 100. Yes. Yeah. OK,
you should say John. Hundred. Yeah. OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/413-2
01:30:12.684 --> 01:30:18.299
<v Josh Sparkes>so it makes sense. Meeting's good,
I think. Can't imagine there's any other.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/414-0
01:30:19.099 --> 01:30:23.663
<v Josh Sparkes>No scenario. Yeah.
Could you drop the play? Double public?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/414-1
01:30:23.663 --> 01:30:24.979
<v Josh Sparkes>Could you unlink?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/415-0
01:30:26.899 --> 01:30:30.594
<v Josh Sparkes>And only Bill on one.
But once they're both there,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/415-1
01:30:30.594 --> 01:30:34.579
<v Josh Sparkes>they're both billable.
Assumably if you if you unlink,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/415-2
01:30:34.579 --> 01:30:38.709
<v Josh Sparkes>that's the point of linking them is one
bill. So if you,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/415-3
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:42.259
<v Josh Sparkes>if you unlinked and still had the second
choose.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/416-0
01:30:42.699 --> 01:30:47.628
<v Josh Sparkes>They're not going to get built. OK,
so that is a check that needs to be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/416-1
01:30:47.628 --> 01:30:52.899
<v Josh Sparkes>happening. Yeah. I mean, that's a three.
Yeah. That's obviously, yeah. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/417-0
01:30:56.299 --> 01:30:59.299
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's good.
Update matter partner update matter</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/417-1
01:30:59.299 --> 01:31:03.942
<v Josh Sparkes>partner. I know we're going line by line,
but actually do you want is that easier</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/417-2
01:31:03.942 --> 01:31:07.452
<v Josh Sparkes>if you do, that's fine.
There's a few states of the referrals</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/417-3
01:31:07.452 --> 01:31:11.358
<v Josh Sparkes>volume discounts is offering. No, no,
that's fine. So update matter,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/417-4
01:31:11.358 --> 01:31:14.699
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll just bring it to that one next
update matter partner.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/418-0
01:31:14.899 --> 01:31:19.859
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Update massive partner or Fiona, so?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/419-0
01:31:21.259 --> 01:31:26.259
<v Josh Sparkes>And ideally what we'd like to see in the
request is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/420-0
01:31:27.579 --> 01:31:32.490
<v Josh Sparkes>That they've advised us that it's been
approved and and the advisors of the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/420-1
01:31:32.490 --> 01:31:37.723
<v Josh Sparkes>dates effective date that they want that
change and that is a constant issue for</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/420-2
01:31:37.723 --> 01:31:41.665
<v Josh Sparkes>the team where you say can you change
this partner? Yes. No,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/420-3
01:31:41.665 --> 01:31:46.123
<v Josh Sparkes>that's my partner they'll say.
Can you change this matter partner to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/420-4
01:31:46.123 --> 01:31:46.899
<v Josh Sparkes>that matter?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/421-0
01:31:46.979 --> 01:31:52.614
<v Josh Sparkes>Partner on that matter number and they
don't tell us that it's been approved by</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/421-1
01:31:52.614 --> 01:31:56.628
<v Josh Sparkes>the other matter partner.
Can I just update master part?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/421-2
01:31:56.628 --> 01:32:01.066
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean it's literally the partner
associated with that matter.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/421-3
01:32:01.066 --> 01:32:05.080
<v Josh Sparkes>So on on the matter,
you'll have basically a like boxing</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/421-4
01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.419
<v Josh Sparkes>matter partner, so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/423-0
01:32:07.059 --> 01:32:10.590
<v Josh Sparkes>Our partner is getting paid for having
that matter have that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/423-1
01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:15.261
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can't just go and change it because
overall way and and they're responsible</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/423-2
01:32:15.261 --> 01:32:18.565
<v Josh Sparkes>for that matter.
But for some reason we're quite often we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/423-3
01:32:18.565 --> 01:32:22.153
<v Josh Sparkes>get lots of these requests,
there will be a request that comes</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/423-4
01:32:22.153 --> 01:32:23.179
<v Josh Sparkes>through to change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/424-0
01:32:23.539 --> 01:32:27.963
<v Josh Sparkes>The name of the person who's the the
partner who's responsible for that matter,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/424-1
01:32:27.963 --> 01:32:31.447
<v Josh Sparkes>and who triggers that PE,
the PE or the new person, or the PE,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/424-2
01:32:31.447 --> 01:32:34.766
<v Josh Sparkes>or the old person.
It could be either or one of the PS from</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/424-3
01:32:34.766 --> 01:32:38.084
<v Josh Sparkes>terms of partners,
but generally the PE is going to trigger</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/424-4
01:32:38.084 --> 01:32:40.739
<v Josh Sparkes>that. They'll send the request,
but it's basic.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/425-0
01:32:41.019 --> 01:32:45.653
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you change the order name?
But that's matter from E to B, right?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/425-1
01:32:45.653 --> 01:32:49.549
<v Josh Sparkes>And but we can't change it without
approval from partner.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/425-2
01:32:49.549 --> 01:32:54.587
<v Josh Sparkes>And we're also meeting the effective bit.
So that's quite important to do.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/425-3
01:32:54.587 --> 01:32:58.281
<v Josh Sparkes>We obviously building and you know that
sort of stuff.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/425-4
01:32:58.281 --> 01:33:00.699
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's something we have to keep.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/426-0
01:33:00.779 --> 01:33:06.317
<v Josh Sparkes>Pushing back on and saying initially what
we used to do is we used to ask the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/426-1
01:33:06.317 --> 01:33:11.288
<v Josh Sparkes>partner or CC the partner in,
but I've changed that process because I</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/426-2
01:33:11.288 --> 01:33:16.897
<v Josh Sparkes>think if the P is telling us we have to
trust them that the that you know that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/426-3
01:33:16.897 --> 01:33:19.099
<v Josh Sparkes>the partners asked for that so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/427-0
01:33:19.459 --> 01:33:22.623
<v Josh Sparkes>What we need really is just for the PE to
say,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/427-1
01:33:22.623 --> 01:33:25.721
<v Josh Sparkes>change the matter partner and matter
partner.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/427-2
01:33:25.721 --> 01:33:30.905

<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just trying to think it's you've got
P on either side,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/428-1
01:33:38.434 --> 01:33:44.096
<v Josh Sparkes>it's long and it could be approval sought
by both partners, which is a net box.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/428-2
01:33:44.096 --> 01:33:47.280

<v Josh Sparkes>By both partners. Yes, yes,
that's what we need to know. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/429-1
01:33:57.370 --> 01:34:00.904
<v Josh Sparkes>because you can't proceed without both
those. Well, anyway,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/429-2
01:34:00.904 --> 01:34:05.735
<v Josh Sparkes>no supporting evidence needs to be no as
much. Just we just need them to tell us.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/429-3
01:34:05.735 --> 01:34:08.739
<v Josh Sparkes>And then you'll get the form to an
effective date.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/430-0
01:34:09.459 --> 01:34:14.493
<v Josh Sparkes>And do you get it such that it's always
SV retrospective or it can only be from</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/430-1
01:34:14.493 --> 01:34:19.780
<v Josh Sparkes>it's? It's got to be a good point. Sorry.
It's got to be, I don't know why this is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/430-2
01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:24.122
<v Josh Sparkes>It's got to be the first of a month.
It doesn't matter which months.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/430-3
01:34:24.122 --> 01:34:28.339
<v Josh Sparkes>So if they want to take we're going into
so it could could get it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/431-0
01:34:28.379 --> 01:34:32.766
<v Josh Sparkes>Today and it said actually it was
effective from the 1st of October,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/431-1
01:34:32.766 --> 01:34:35.945
<v Josh Sparkes>that's OK.
So we can do 1st of September 1st, OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/431-2
01:34:35.945 --> 01:34:39.124
<v Josh Sparkes>but it doesn't matter and if it's for the
future,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/431-3
01:34:39.124 --> 01:34:42.939
<v Josh Sparkes>if they want it for the 1st of November
and it's on health.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/433-0
01:34:44.379 --> 01:34:49.332
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's in the future, it's for us.
There's less work for us. But within 3 E.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/433-1
01:34:49.332 --> 01:34:52.381
<v Josh Sparkes>But if it's generally,
we have to take it back.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/433-2
01:34:52.381 --> 01:34:55.302
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just saying that retrospective or no,
no,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/433-3
01:34:55.302 --> 01:35:00.446
<v Josh Sparkes>they just tell it doesn't matter which
they can take it back to any date at all,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/433-4
01:35:00.446 --> 01:35:03.939
<v Josh Sparkes>but they need to tell us the date. See,
see if we can.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/434-0
01:35:04.339 --> 01:35:09.363
<v Josh Sparkes>Enforce that pick in the first,
which if we can be a first date, yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/434-1
01:35:09.363 --> 01:35:13.096
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, you're going to do that so well.
So they say,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/434-2
01:35:13.096 --> 01:35:17.762
<v Josh Sparkes>and it's probably a good point.
Like they'll put it in on today.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/434-3
01:35:17.762 --> 01:35:20.059
<v Josh Sparkes>You'll just do it on the 1st of.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/435-0
01:35:20.259 --> 01:35:23.971
<v Josh Sparkes>We would go back and say, well,
we can only do it from the 1st,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/435-1
01:35:23.971 --> 01:35:27.509
<v Josh Sparkes>1st of each month,
which months that you need is to put your</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/435-2
01:35:27.509 --> 01:35:30.294
<v Josh Sparkes>support.
That could be an easing in question so</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/435-3
01:35:30.294 --> 01:35:34.296
<v Josh Sparkes>they could circuit comes in today only
like the middle of the month,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/435-4
01:35:34.296 --> 01:35:37.777
<v Josh Sparkes>15th of October,
do they go to the first of they have soda.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/435-5
01:35:37.777 --> 01:35:39.459
<v Josh Sparkes>So the first of their number.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/436-0
01:35:40.339 --> 01:35:46.925
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a good point that we did get that
leading. Yeah. Leading question to. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/436-1
01:35:46.925 --> 01:35:50.416
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. OK, that's good.
And then you get it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/436-2
01:35:50.416 --> 01:35:55.098
<v Josh Sparkes>it lands with anybody or is there
segregation where? Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/436-3
01:35:55.098 --> 01:35:59.939
<v Josh Sparkes>so we get that through and we've got the
approval we've got.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/437-0
01:36:00.019 --> 01:36:05.752
<v Josh Sparkes>With the we update 3 and then we just.
Well, you could just close any cheques.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/437-1
01:36:05.752 --> 01:36:10.251
<v Josh Sparkes>Could you just say,
is there anything else you need to check?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/437-2
01:36:10.251 --> 01:36:15.259
<v Josh Sparkes>No, no, that's it. Once it's done,
this has been completed. OK. Yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/438-0
01:36:15.739 --> 01:36:18.109
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
And then it's close to complete and then</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/438-1
01:36:18.109 --> 01:36:21.426
<v Josh Sparkes>the PE will be informed it's done. Yeah.
And it could include,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/438-2
01:36:21.426 --> 01:36:24.744
<v Josh Sparkes>you should say and this is effective,
but in the notification,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/438-3
01:36:24.744 --> 01:36:27.061
<v Josh Sparkes>this is effective from the 1st of
November,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/438-4
01:36:27.061 --> 01:36:30.958
<v Josh Sparkes>so that he is very clear back location to
them. So you don't say oh gosh,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/438-5
01:36:30.958 --> 01:36:33.539
<v Josh Sparkes>what I meant was the first year it's over.
Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/439-0
01:36:35.099 --> 01:36:38.613
<v Josh Sparkes>So on the e-mail chair,
we just see this has been completed. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/439-1
01:36:38.613 --> 01:36:40.659
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, yeah. But it will be coming from.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/440-0
01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:53.499
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there a few matter of referrals that
would update update referrals?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/441-0
01:36:55.859 --> 01:36:57.419
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes. So we could have.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/442-0
01:36:59.779 --> 01:37:02.584
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
there's certain people who's going to get</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/442-1
01:37:02.584 --> 01:37:06.559
<v Josh Sparkes>the credit for that matter,
so it's usually the partner in one box,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/442-2
01:37:06.559 --> 01:37:11.235
<v Josh Sparkes>but it could be as a team one we could
have maybe two or three people in there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/442-3
01:37:11.235 --> 01:37:14.859
<v Josh Sparkes>And so that's the same thing as we just
still just say to us.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/443-0
01:37:17.019 --> 01:37:21.406
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you add this person you know?
And that's how many options on the matter</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/443-1
01:37:21.406 --> 01:37:25.101
<v Josh Sparkes>can you have is, I mean,
are all of them fear is there only one</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/443-2
01:37:25.101 --> 01:37:29.777
<v Josh Sparkes>that's apparent the organised multiple.
So for the affairs it's it's who's going</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/443-3
01:37:29.777 --> 01:37:33.299
<v Josh Sparkes>to get a percentage.
Well sorry who's going to get what the.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/444-0
01:37:34.139 --> 01:37:38.742
<v Josh Sparkes>What we've had had before actually,
which is a good point to show on if we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/444-1
01:37:38.742 --> 01:37:42.977
<v Josh Sparkes>were going to put that in The thing is to
see that it will be equal.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/444-2
01:37:42.977 --> 01:37:47.826
<v Josh Sparkes>So sometimes like they'll come through
and they'll say 70% is for this partner</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/444-3
01:37:47.826 --> 01:37:51.939
<v Josh Sparkes>and 30% for that partner.
And we have to go out and say it's 5050.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/445-0
01:37:52.259 --> 01:37:57.628
<v Josh Sparkes>You know or Step 3, but if it's changed,
so if we do the if we do the change that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/445-1
01:37:57.628 --> 01:38:00.968
<v Josh Sparkes>100% is changing nought percent,
it's one to 100%.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/445-2
01:38:00.968 --> 01:38:06.075
<v Josh Sparkes>There's always one person on there.
So they need change that and that's fine.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/445-3
01:38:06.075 --> 01:38:10.659
<v Josh Sparkes>And again we need approval because that's
affecting people's pockets.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/446-0
01:38:11.019 --> 01:38:16.242
<v Josh Sparkes>And so we need approval and then you want
to add another person and obviously that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/446-1
01:38:16.242 --> 01:38:20.207
<v Josh Sparkes>needs approval as well.
But if it's only if it's two people in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/446-2
01:38:20.207 --> 01:38:24.171
<v Josh Sparkes>there, it's a straight 5050,
it's two people split three ways.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/446-3
01:38:24.171 --> 01:38:29.332
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes we get questions and they think
that they can do it 10% for that person</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/446-4
01:38:29.332 --> 01:38:30.339
<v Josh Sparkes>and 30 for that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/447-0
01:38:30.699 --> 01:38:34.895
<v Josh Sparkes>But yeah, and that there's 100%. Yeah,
yeah. OK, so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/447-1
01:38:34.895 --> 01:38:40.040
<v Josh Sparkes>But those walls are picked up by
presumably. Yeah. Well, I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/447-2
01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:44.553
<v Josh Sparkes>as we put them in,
we don't put percentages that does it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/447-3
01:38:44.553 --> 01:38:48.986
<v Josh Sparkes>itself, but yeah.
But we think that we can. Yeah. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/447-4
01:38:48.986 --> 01:38:49.699
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/448-0
01:38:51.099 --> 01:38:56.242
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've always got the primary,
then you've got referrals that added add</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/448-1
01:38:56.242 --> 01:39:00.904
<v Josh Sparkes>additional, yes, yeah, OK.
So and the PE will be doing that of that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/448-2
01:39:00.904 --> 01:39:06.116
<v Josh Sparkes>part of that, yeah, primary partner.
So since then again we need on that at</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/448-3
01:39:06.116 --> 01:39:08.379
<v Josh Sparkes>that one we need approval of the.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/449-0
01:39:09.179 --> 01:39:14.301
<v Josh Sparkes>Person who's the fairer at the moment?
Because what we're saying is that you're</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/449-1
01:39:14.301 --> 01:39:18.719
<v Josh Sparkes>splitting your profits so you know.
So the other 100% at the moment.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/449-2
01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:22.880
<v Josh Sparkes>So we need their approval against from
the I'm seeking that yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/449-3
01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:27.106
<v Josh Sparkes>So all we need is has this been approved?
No supporting evidence,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/449-4
01:39:27.106 --> 01:39:28.579
<v Josh Sparkes>no supporting evidence.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/450-0
01:39:28.659 --> 01:39:32.560
<v Josh Sparkes>If you want to trust them,
I'm saying that he's happy. Yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/450-1
01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:37.696
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm approval from the just. Well, yeah,
just for the person who's in has this.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/450-2
01:39:37.696 --> 01:39:41.597
<v Josh Sparkes>Whoever's on there.
So if your name's on there with the CP,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/450-3
01:39:41.597 --> 01:39:46.148
<v Josh Sparkes>has, you know, has approval been saved,
you know, for yourself? Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/450-4
01:39:46.148 --> 01:39:48.099
<v Josh Sparkes>It's going to actually reject.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/451-0
01:39:50.619 --> 01:39:52.979
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.
Occasionally a partner will say no.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/452-0
01:39:56.299 --> 01:39:59.393
<v Josh Sparkes>Not very absolutely.
About twice I've seen it. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/452-1
01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:04.063
<v Josh Sparkes>that's not the first time the partners
hearing it, is it at this point? No. No,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/452-2
01:40:04.063 --> 01:40:07.741
<v Josh Sparkes>it should be. It should be. You know,
that they've said it so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/452-3
01:40:07.741 --> 01:40:11.419
<v Josh Sparkes>But very occasionally when we've not seen
it. That's the same.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/453-0
01:40:11.699 --> 01:40:17.930
<v Josh Sparkes>As it's been approved and then the
partner will come back and say,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/453-1
01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:22.580
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh my money,
that's that's straightforward. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/453-2
01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:26.859
<v Josh Sparkes>Currency updates again that can be come
from.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/454-0
01:40:27.619 --> 01:40:33.459
<v Josh Sparkes>PE. Is that correct? Yeah. I'm just sorry.
So update matters. Status wait matter.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/454-1
01:40:33.459 --> 01:40:38.872
<v Josh Sparkes>When? Since matter of currency update. Oh,
yes, sorry. So we're just. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/454-2
01:40:38.872 --> 01:40:41.579
<v Josh Sparkes>So basically updating the so when the.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/455-0
01:40:42.659 --> 01:40:47.204
<v Josh Sparkes>Usually the key and when they originally
opened the matter,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/455-1
01:40:47.204 --> 01:40:52.962
<v Josh Sparkes>they will select the relevant currency,
but sometimes it has to be changed.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/455-2
01:40:52.962 --> 01:40:59.099
<v Josh Sparkes>So we we will go in and just changing
currency is that because it was chosen in.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/456-0
01:40:59.699 --> 01:41:02.620
<v Josh Sparkes>Error or that the billing or it's? Yeah,
yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/456-1
01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:05.541
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be that they've done it in the
error,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/456-2
01:41:05.541 --> 01:41:10.388
<v Josh Sparkes>the PE or for some reason it has to be
changed because the client wants to be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/456-3
01:41:10.388 --> 01:41:14.739
<v Josh Sparkes>billed and U.S. dollars or, you know,
there could be various reasons.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/457-0
01:41:15.019 --> 01:41:20.222
<v Josh Sparkes>That they would have set the batter up
initially with whatever currency,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/457-1
01:41:20.222 --> 01:41:25.211
<v Josh Sparkes>and then they'll they'll come to us and
ask us to change. But I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/457-2
01:41:25.211 --> 01:41:30.699
<v Josh Sparkes>if you go back to how they were on
boarded as a client in terms of payments.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/458-0
01:41:31.019 --> 01:41:33.691
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we set at that point,
aren't they?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/458-1
01:41:33.691 --> 01:41:38.307
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that's where your what your pays in
how your pay is, how your frequency.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/458-2
01:41:38.307 --> 01:41:42.073
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just wondering where it lies with
yourself as the change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/458-3
01:41:42.073 --> 01:41:46.992
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah I guess because the change has got
to be done in 3 E the reasons for change</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/458-4
01:41:46.992 --> 01:41:47.539
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/459-0
01:41:48.179 --> 01:41:52.805
<v Josh Sparkes>Assuming it's to do with either an error
or the client wants to be building that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/459-1
01:41:52.805 --> 01:41:56.345
<v Josh Sparkes>currency and yeah,
you're you're right in what you're saying,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/459-2
01:41:56.345 --> 01:42:00.743
<v Josh Sparkes>whether it should have been set up
originally. Yeah. Is that something that,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/459-3
01:42:00.743 --> 01:42:05.026
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, it's sort of like, well,
what compliance cheques are done that I</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/459-4
01:42:05.026 --> 01:42:07.539
<v Josh Sparkes>can suddenly, you know,
maybe the exchange.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/460-0
01:42:07.739 --> 01:42:10.802
<v Josh Sparkes>Market is such that,
let's say much I no longer want to be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/460-1
01:42:10.802 --> 01:42:15.214
<v Josh Sparkes>paid. You know, it's great if I'm and you.
You don't want that sort of a reoccurring</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/460-2
01:42:15.214 --> 01:42:18.640
<v Josh Sparkes>event where it's actually stronger to be
paid in yours and it is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/460-3
01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:22.534
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean that isn't that something that's
agreed upfront that should be goes</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/460-4
01:42:22.534 --> 01:42:26.739
<v Josh Sparkes>through another initiated process before
you can just request a currency change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/461-0
01:42:27.579 --> 01:42:31.956
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just guess I'm just. Yeah,
I know this is helpful,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/461-1
01:42:31.956 --> 01:42:35.139
<v Josh Sparkes>but in other legal fans we've seen like.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/462-0
01:42:39.659 --> 01:42:43.115
<v Josh Sparkes>This is helpful,
but in other legal firms we've seen like</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/462-1
01:42:43.115 --> 01:42:45.916
<v Josh Sparkes>between them and the firms or between
clients,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/462-2
01:42:45.916 --> 01:42:48.895
<v Josh Sparkes>you have a fixed FF and on both sides at
the ±5%.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/462-3
01:42:48.895 --> 01:42:52.054
<v Josh Sparkes>Because let's say this month the dollar
is stronger,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/462-4
01:42:52.054 --> 01:42:54.855
<v Josh Sparkes>you don't want to keep like the map of
effort.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/462-5
01:42:54.855 --> 01:42:57.179
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have a see what changes monsters.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/463-0
01:42:57.259 --> 01:43:01.307
<v Josh Sparkes>As a fixed monthly,
if you have a variation or you allow for</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/463-1
01:43:01.307 --> 01:43:04.294
<v Josh Sparkes>flux,
therefore you don't have to keep well,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/463-2
01:43:04.294 --> 01:43:09.404
<v Josh Sparkes>we don't we we don't do that exchange,
we just change literally the current.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/463-3
01:43:09.404 --> 01:43:13.784
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that's all we do.
But when it comes to the billing part and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/463-4
01:43:13.784 --> 01:43:14.979
<v Josh Sparkes>within the system.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/464-0
01:43:15.579 --> 01:43:20.362
<v Josh Sparkes>Each month there is a set, you know? Yeah.
Yeah, extra. It was more the challenges.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/464-1
01:43:20.362 --> 01:43:23.608
<v Josh Sparkes>Should you be changing?
I think that's probably what I'm</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/464-2
01:43:23.608 --> 01:43:26.626
<v Josh Sparkes>generating.
Is that where it lands or should it even</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/464-3
01:43:26.626 --> 01:43:30.499
<v Josh Sparkes>what would be change it?
Because we usually find that most science.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/465-0
01:43:31.139 --> 01:43:31.499
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/466-0
01:43:33.859 --> 01:43:38.056
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably maybe hard to cut.
It's not loads. Yes, as we get them,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/466-1
01:43:38.056 --> 01:43:42.189
<v Josh Sparkes>I do get them every month.
Usually in your MSA or your standard</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/466-2
01:43:42.189 --> 01:43:45.870
<v Josh Sparkes>agreement, yes,
so maybe five or six times a month maybe</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/466-3
01:43:45.870 --> 01:43:49.099
<v Josh Sparkes>I guess, OK.
It's not loads but it does you know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/467-0
01:43:49.699 --> 01:43:53.664
<v Josh Sparkes>Obviously we change it because we've been
totally just on that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/467-1
01:43:53.664 --> 01:43:58.745
<v Josh Sparkes>I take it those requests just comes via
e-mail from the PE just to ask if you can</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/467-2
01:43:58.745 --> 01:44:03.888
<v Josh Sparkes>change the currency or the yes or there's
some reason they're expecting it to be a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/467-3
01:44:03.888 --> 01:44:06.739
<v Josh Sparkes>different currency. So, yeah, yeah. OK,
cool.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/468-0
01:44:08.339 --> 01:44:12.405
<v Josh Sparkes>Just wanted to add,
I don't know if it is relevant here or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/468-1
01:44:12.405 --> 01:44:15.644
<v Josh Sparkes>not,
but and see and senior associate has been</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/468-2
01:44:15.644 --> 01:44:18.884
<v Josh Sparkes>as as a standard set up as a GB P to be
built,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/468-3
01:44:18.884 --> 01:44:23.708
<v Josh Sparkes>but then working on a different matter.
He could have an AUD as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/468-4
01:44:23.708 --> 01:44:27.499
<v Josh Sparkes>So like multiple currency set up in
different matters.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/469-0
01:44:27.699 --> 01:44:32.095
<v Josh Sparkes>Thanks. OK.
And sorry just there so it could be that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/469-1
01:44:32.095 --> 01:44:38.399
<v Josh Sparkes>we set up rates at client level through
the engagement letter and it's U.S.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/469-2
01:44:38.399 --> 01:44:43.459
<v Josh Sparkes>dollars and maybe it's U.S.
dollars and pounds and then for.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/470-0
01:44:43.979 --> 01:44:47.836
<v Josh Sparkes>And Europe a partner As for appeal say
this is coming through as U.S.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/470-1
01:44:47.836 --> 01:44:51.197
<v Josh Sparkes>dollars and we'll say this is because we
explain the reason.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/470-2
01:44:51.197 --> 01:44:55.716
<v Josh Sparkes>But with the there's obviously been some
agreement which we can't obviously argue</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/470-3
01:44:55.716 --> 01:44:58.195
<v Josh Sparkes>about.
We want it in euros and at that point</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/470-4
01:44:58.195 --> 01:45:02.659
<v Josh Sparkes>then we have to manually get into the
matter and do each rate class or whatever.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/472-0
01:45:03.779 --> 01:45:07.296
<v Josh Sparkes>So when you so the even this is a matter
currency update,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/472-1
01:45:07.296 --> 01:45:12.270
<v Josh Sparkes>you might also be doing it on the rates
up when you have to because there's rates</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/472-2
01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:16.030
<v Josh Sparkes>associated with it. Yeah.
And there's no EUR at client level,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/472-3
01:45:16.030 --> 01:45:20.215
<v Josh Sparkes>but the West net market level.
So we'd have to go up the increase as</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/472-4
01:45:20.215 --> 01:45:22.459
<v Josh Sparkes>well. So that's a matter and my very.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/473-0
01:45:24.979 --> 01:45:27.395
<v Josh Sparkes>Reason that you're doing the currency
change,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/473-1
01:45:27.395 --> 01:45:31.177
<v Josh Sparkes>you would change the rates at the same
time we would have to, yeah. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/473-2
01:45:31.177 --> 01:45:35.380
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's not necessary a matter currency
update, it's a matter and rates update,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/473-3
01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:38.426
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, it could be both. Yeah,
could be always both. Well,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/473-4
01:45:38.426 --> 01:45:41.893
<v Josh Sparkes>not always both. You know,
it should be just if we look at client</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/473-5
01:45:41.893 --> 01:45:42.419
<v Josh Sparkes>level and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/474-0
01:45:42.699 --> 01:45:47.976
<v Josh Sparkes>So let's just Europe, that is euro rates,
but the matter is the US dollars,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/474-1
01:45:47.976 --> 01:45:53.670
<v Josh Sparkes>you literally just change it to euros and
you create euro rates will pull through</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/474-2
01:45:53.670 --> 01:45:57.697
<v Josh Sparkes>to the matter. But if at matter level,
you know it's EUR,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/474-3
01:45:57.697 --> 01:46:02.419
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's pulling through U.S. dollars,
then likely at client level.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/475-0
01:46:02.739 --> 01:46:08.517
<v Josh Sparkes>There is no EUR, so yes.
So then we have to get what's the actual</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/475-1
01:46:08.517 --> 01:46:14.295
<v Josh Sparkes>EUR for that or is it to the exchange
rate of the Kingdom? Sorry.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/475-2
01:46:14.295 --> 01:46:19.899
<v Josh Sparkes>Does the Ashurst billing entity change at
the same time as the?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/476-0
01:46:21.099 --> 01:46:21.859
<v Josh Sparkes>Breathe change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/477-0
01:46:23.579 --> 01:46:27.590
<v Josh Sparkes>Hello.
And there's also an education piece on</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/477-1
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:33.520
<v Josh Sparkes>this part as well actually,
because again as the state of the rates</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/477-2
01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:40.410
<v Josh Sparkes>for the client level with that currency,
sometimes it's not that understanding</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/477-3
01:46:40.410 --> 01:46:42.939
<v Josh Sparkes>that's why and then we start.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/478-0
01:46:43.099 --> 01:46:46.035
<v Josh Sparkes>Then, well,
you need to tell us what the euro rates</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/478-1
01:46:46.035 --> 01:46:50.327
<v Josh Sparkes>is and we say well, we can have PE,
but that's APE, OK. So education, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/478-2
01:46:50.327 --> 01:46:54.958
<v Josh Sparkes>So we don't think we can catch that as in,
yeah, and this is kicking a big thing.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/478-3
01:46:54.958 --> 01:46:58.459
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's two options there we you know
they have to either.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/479-0
01:46:59.419 --> 01:47:03.638
<v Josh Sparkes>Let's talk about the exchange rate so
they can do that and they can change it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/479-1
01:47:03.638 --> 01:47:07.911
<v Josh Sparkes>at billing point and it'll be whatever
the exchange rate is and or quite often</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/479-2
01:47:07.911 --> 01:47:11.751
<v Josh Sparkes>they say, well, no, we want,
we want you to rates and it will be fixed</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/479-3
01:47:11.751 --> 01:47:15.754
<v Josh Sparkes>in the matter. And we'll say no,
the partner has to go and negotiate that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/479-4
01:47:15.754 --> 01:47:18.459
<v Josh Sparkes>with the client because it's not been
negotiated.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/480-0
01:47:18.539 --> 01:47:23.675
<v Josh Sparkes>Appreciated. OK, so the push back, yes,
one again, but they're not aware of that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/480-1
01:47:23.675 --> 01:47:26.619
<v Josh Sparkes>That's clear. Like peace. OK. Yes,
that's not.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/482-0
01:47:25.619 --> 01:47:29.543
<v Mark Sedge>That might be. That might be.
It might be an option for knowledge,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/481-0
01:47:29.459 --> 01:47:32.659
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/482-1
01:47:29.543 --> 01:47:34.170
<v Mark Sedge>a knowledge article or something like
that to not whether or not they read it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/482-2
01:47:34.170 --> 01:47:38.739
<v Mark Sedge>but at least you can point them back to
it as A-frame of reference as to why.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/483-0
01:47:39.379 --> 01:47:42.194
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah, it sounds, you know,
you explain it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/483-1
01:47:42.194 --> 01:47:46.330
<v Josh Sparkes>but actually when you're probably really
on Royal Charles School or be,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/483-2
01:47:46.330 --> 01:47:49.145
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean it could be,
I just don't send a request,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/483-3
01:47:49.145 --> 01:47:53.338
<v Josh Sparkes>but education piece that could be.
So we've got the that made sense that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/483-4
01:47:53.338 --> 01:47:55.579
<v Josh Sparkes>you're going to receive it from the PE.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/484-0
01:47:55.899 --> 01:48:00.676
<v Josh Sparkes>You can change it from and you can
capture this EUR dollars dollars and then</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/484-1
01:48:00.676 --> 01:48:03.653
<v Josh Sparkes>it's close,
complete and they can be given that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/484-2
01:48:03.653 --> 01:48:06.817
<v Josh Sparkes>notification or reason for rejection.
As you said,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/484-3
01:48:06.817 --> 01:48:11.532
<v Josh Sparkes>an educational piece that they can
receive and you check the reason why the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/484-4
01:48:11.532 --> 01:48:12.339
<v Josh Sparkes>objective is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/485-0
01:48:12.619 --> 01:48:15.415
<v Josh Sparkes>And again,
close complaints still wouldn't be a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/485-1
01:48:15.415 --> 01:48:19.901
<v Josh Sparkes>problem and reject when we go back and
explain what the reason is and we and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/485-2
01:48:19.901 --> 01:48:24.504
<v Josh Sparkes>we'd have to explain that we would have
to go and do at the performer and when</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/485-3
01:48:24.504 --> 01:48:28.699
<v Josh Sparkes>they, you know, create a performer,
they'll have to change the currency</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/485-4
01:48:28.699 --> 01:48:31.379
<v Josh Sparkes>themselves and get the effects exchange
rate.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/486-0
01:48:32.779 --> 01:48:38.158
<v Josh Sparkes>Or if they want particular reason and in
euros they need to supply us,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/486-1
01:48:38.158 --> 01:48:44.144
<v Josh Sparkes>though we can't make up because there's
not been any negotiated rates or that,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/486-2
01:48:44.144 --> 01:48:49.979
<v Josh Sparkes>but those could be some options that you
can get maybe is on hold therefore.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/487-0
01:48:50.419 --> 01:48:54.783
<v Josh Sparkes>Until they do this,
so that's a notification that goes back</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/487-1
01:48:54.783 --> 01:49:00.676
<v Josh Sparkes>and then you can see that that it's been
done. And then phrase complaints. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/487-2
01:49:00.676 --> 01:49:05.259
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. And they tend to be opposed option,
profound performer or.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/488-0
01:49:05.619 --> 01:49:09.340
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, they change. Yes,
they do formulate it and they change the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/488-1
01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:14.092
<v Josh Sparkes>currency themselves and then they'll get
the exchange rate if they want the actual</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/488-2
01:49:14.092 --> 01:49:17.470
<v Josh Sparkes>currency change.
And it's we don't have the currency rates</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/488-3
01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:20.619
<v Josh Sparkes>for that client.
They have to tell us what the actual.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/489-0
01:49:21.019 --> 01:49:25.219
<v Josh Sparkes>We is in that kind of so we we can't just
see. Yeah, that's an educational piece,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/489-1
01:49:25.219 --> 01:49:28.548
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's leading inside the smell that
you've got those options.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/489-2
01:49:28.548 --> 01:49:30.699
<v Josh Sparkes>And we sent 30 emeralds apart on that, OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/490-0
01:49:34.699 --> 01:49:38.340
<v Josh Sparkes>Volume discounts.
I saw that and I just thought this now.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/490-1
01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:41.793
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean you could have a quick break or
you could make,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/490-2
01:49:41.793 --> 01:49:46.250
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe we'll just take a few.
I think we'll have a green if you want to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/490-3
01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:48.699
<v Josh Sparkes>volume volume, that's all the girls in.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/491-0
01:49:52.219 --> 01:49:55.670
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't feel that bad.
I think if we're wanting to run through</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/491-1
01:49:55.670 --> 01:49:59.504
<v Josh Sparkes>and try and finish early today,
then I think we take a break and then</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/491-2
01:49:59.504 --> 01:50:03.722
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll do volume biscuits. Yeah. Yeah.
Believe me, you'll need it. I promise.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/491-3
01:50:03.722 --> 01:50:05.859
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the right thing to do. 10 minutes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/492-0
01:50:06.499 --> 01:50:07.539
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, 5 past.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/493-0
01:50:08.979 --> 01:50:11.299
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, rounding up Mark? Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/494-0
01:50:12.499 --> 01:50:12.939
<v Mark Sedge>Thanks.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/498-0
01:50:13.739 --> 01:50:14.179
<v Josh Sparkes>Cheers.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/495-0
01:50:15.179 --> 01:50:15.499
<v Parik>See you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/499-0
01:50:33.419 --> 01:50:33.939
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/501-0
01:50:40.099 --> 01:50:55.859
<v Josh Sparkes>I know that we're doing a few, maybe.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/502-0
01:50:56.059 --> 01:51:07.224
<v Josh Sparkes>So by it's that.
So if from here we got there's five there</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/502-1
01:51:07.224 --> 01:51:13.659
<v Josh Sparkes>done not mention which one was 10.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/503-0
01:51:14.419 --> 01:51:17.925
<v Josh Sparkes>Being A50,
we're not quite at halfway point,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/503-1
01:51:17.925 --> 01:51:24.158
<v Josh Sparkes>but if we could just have a look at the
managed matter one and just have a look</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/503-2
01:51:24.158 --> 01:51:29.768
<v Josh Sparkes>at that initial view. What what's next?
Yeah, so volume, manual update,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/503-3
01:51:29.768 --> 01:51:30.859
<v Josh Sparkes>matter status.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/504-0
01:51:34.099 --> 01:51:39.146
<v Josh Sparkes>And I'll just do down and then client
rates issues,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/504-1
01:51:39.146 --> 01:51:44.484
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe that's manage rates on that one
that's the same,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/504-2
01:51:44.484 --> 01:51:51.084
<v Josh Sparkes>is it it's a full duplicate,
yeah duplicate manage that's the rate.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/504-3
01:51:51.084 --> 01:51:53.219
<v Josh Sparkes>So we may have to get.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/505-0
01:51:54.219 --> 01:51:59.641
<v Josh Sparkes>And we put some properties like that
sudden stuff, address maintenance.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/505-1
01:51:59.641 --> 01:52:05.590
<v Josh Sparkes>We actually have a long whole load of
like that came on the client that was we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/505-2
01:52:05.590 --> 01:52:09.656
<v Josh Sparkes>captured that address change as part of
fight matter.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/505-3
01:52:09.656 --> 01:52:12.819
<v Josh Sparkes>We capture that address maintenance again.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/506-0
01:52:13.859 --> 01:52:17.432
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you look at,
if you have a look at the blue column,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/506-1
01:52:17.432 --> 01:52:22.053
<v Josh Sparkes>if we look at if you can sort by,
I can see new matter assurance check and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/506-2
01:52:22.053 --> 01:52:25.072
<v Josh Sparkes>new matter assurance check.
There's a few check.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/506-3
01:52:25.072 --> 01:52:29.139
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a few we can group those.
There's another one down below.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/507-0
01:52:29.939 --> 01:52:32.881
<v Josh Sparkes>They're different over here, though. Yes,
I know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/507-1
01:52:32.881 --> 01:52:37.530
<v Josh Sparkes>But we can discuss it as a three like we
did new payer. We did five in one go.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/507-2
01:52:37.530 --> 01:52:41.649
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah. So if you Scroll down,
I think there's another one. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/507-3
01:52:41.649 --> 01:52:46.181
<v Josh Sparkes>So maybe if we make the screen a bit
smaller, we think on 90% with the move.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/507-4
01:52:46.181 --> 01:52:47.299
<v Josh Sparkes>So just move it up.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/508-0
01:52:51.019 --> 01:52:51.299
<v Josh Sparkes>Time.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/509-0
01:52:53.699 --> 01:52:58.097
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that's great. Yeah.
And that's a great query that manage rate</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/509-1
01:52:58.097 --> 01:53:02.495
<v Josh Sparkes>at the bottom of the actually,
they're both rates pursuing a bit of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/509-2
01:53:02.495 --> 01:53:06.699
<v Josh Sparkes>money. Those two bottom ones,
that's that's great. That's great.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/510-0
01:53:10.979 --> 01:53:15.838
<v Josh Sparkes>But we'll also find it all so we've got a
new matter of quality assurance suit.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/510-1
01:53:15.838 --> 01:53:19.239
<v Josh Sparkes>Again, new measure,
quality assurance number to address</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/510-2
01:53:19.239 --> 01:53:22.883
<v Josh Sparkes>maintenance. That's one,
that's one that would be to go up.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/510-3
01:53:22.883 --> 01:53:27.013
<v Josh Sparkes>That's address maintenance. Oh,
there's another matter that sure is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/510-4
01:53:27.013 --> 01:53:27.499
<v Josh Sparkes>checked.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/511-0
01:53:28.259 --> 01:53:32.415
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh yeah,
patient sessions where the additional</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/511-1
01:53:32.415 --> 01:53:39.046
<v Josh Sparkes>batch of stories as well, it's clear.
So we've probably seen it's like the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/511-2
01:53:39.046 --> 01:53:41.699
<v Josh Sparkes>first batching as another one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/512-0
01:53:43.859 --> 01:53:49.262
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll have to find out. Yeah, but so.
And we so we need to get to that bit</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/512-1
01:53:49.262 --> 01:53:53.441
<v Josh Sparkes>before we need to do matter by 12.
What else? What do we?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/512-2
01:53:53.441 --> 01:53:56.899
<v Josh Sparkes>How much are we left with after rates and
time?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/513-0
01:54:03.819 --> 01:54:09.424
<v Josh Sparkes>Amend rates Amendment Insurance check
those quickly. These ones? Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/513-1
01:54:09.424 --> 01:54:15.819
<v Josh Sparkes>Because for example. Yeah. Amend and new.
We go up. Are they all? Amend and new.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/514-0
01:54:16.699 --> 01:54:20.220
<v Josh Sparkes>One's a query amending new makes sense
that makes sense.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/514-1
01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:25.038
<v Josh Sparkes>I think they're all amended. New. Yeah.
What? Also, they show the back. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/514-2
01:54:25.038 --> 01:54:29.609
<v Josh Sparkes>if you just figure the blue columns,
one's a query and one's amended new.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/514-3
01:54:29.609 --> 01:54:31.339
<v Josh Sparkes>So we go for it further out.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/515-0
01:54:32.499 --> 01:54:37.747
<v Josh Sparkes>Query query and that's time cards. Yeah,
so this one's quite simple. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/515-1
01:54:37.747 --> 01:54:42.282
<v Josh Sparkes>And time. So we've got. Yeah.
So I think we've got managed time cards</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/515-2
01:54:42.282 --> 01:54:46.299
<v Josh Sparkes>in there but but. But for rates,
it's amended new apart from.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/516-0
01:54:47.339 --> 01:54:52.898
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, there's that's up. Yeah, well,
it's that's cool. Client.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/516-1
01:54:52.898 --> 01:54:57.819
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that all of them? Well,
client rate card and then.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/517-0
01:55:01.899 --> 01:55:09.657
<v Josh Sparkes>I might run down and get a match.
I'm sorry I didn't. Yeah. No, no,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/517-1
01:55:09.657 --> 01:55:15.819
<v Josh Sparkes>we just like, you know. Well,
the only two yesterday.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/518-0
01:55:19.339 --> 01:55:26.532
<v Josh Sparkes>All that seems like,
so I think we're trying to understand</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/518-1
01:55:26.532 --> 01:55:32.140
<v Josh Sparkes>that it's team label way more starting
teams,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/518-2
01:55:32.140 --> 01:55:37.139
<v Josh Sparkes>so that it comes out and that team label.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/520-0
01:55:37.779 --> 01:55:42.791
<v Josh Sparkes>And they won't be filtered by fabulous.
I'm a cylinder. Would.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/520-1
01:55:42.791 --> 01:55:49.235
<v Josh Sparkes>So always such bench I would to be right.
There would be stories for everything.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/520-2
01:55:49.235 --> 01:55:52.259
<v Josh Sparkes>Every two weeks. No, that's right. So.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/521-0
01:55:53.419 --> 01:55:57.884
<v Josh Sparkes>We just need to remain full of that.
The teams needs to know that it would be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/521-1
01:55:57.884 --> 01:56:01.090
<v Josh Sparkes>a two week signal.
You have a one week signal of space,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/521-2
01:56:01.090 --> 01:56:04.182
<v Josh Sparkes>one of this preventable.
How was it 214 and one week?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/521-3
01:56:04.182 --> 01:56:08.819
<v Josh Sparkes>So this Ben is 2 weeks to what I mean as
there could be an opportunity to rear I</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/521-4
01:56:08.819 --> 01:56:11.739
<v Josh Sparkes>think 2 weeks with a new user,
students community.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/522-0
01:56:13.419 --> 01:56:18.109
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it is an example,
so we will expect two weeks. No,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/522-1
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:23.594
<v Josh Sparkes>that's not what we're seeing.
But what we're seeing is that's how we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/522-2
01:56:23.594 --> 01:56:26.059
<v Josh Sparkes>build process works, right, so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/523-0
01:56:28.059 --> 01:56:34.118
<v Josh Sparkes>Depending on C, building 100 processes,
C50 of them are one has to be right?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/523-1
01:56:34.118 --> 01:56:37.738
<v Josh Sparkes>That's your.
That's your bunch for refunding.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/523-2
01:56:37.738 --> 01:56:42.539
<v Josh Sparkes>So so so one out of 150 this will be
something. Yeah I will.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/524-0
01:56:43.139 --> 01:56:47.039
<v Josh Sparkes>The team will get one week to review at
the very time and within that,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/524-1
01:56:47.039 --> 01:56:51.213
<v Josh Sparkes>first of all, happy to do as well.
Like for some reason. Yeah. So I'm just.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/524-2
01:56:51.213 --> 01:56:55.662
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm going for those 50 cases and then the
remaining 50 can be split like this by</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/524-3
01:56:55.662 --> 01:56:58.299
<v Josh Sparkes>exactly. Yeah. OK. I'll make sure. Yeah.
Right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/525-0
01:56:59.579 --> 01:57:03.300
<v Josh Sparkes>And it may not be every.
It may not be every two weeks that we get</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/525-1
01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:05.800
<v Josh Sparkes>back,
because if they're really complex one,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/525-2
01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:10.300
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll say there was other fifty year it
may take six weeks before we've actually</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/525-3
01:57:10.300 --> 01:57:12.744
<v Josh Sparkes>then.
So I have on weekly for example and I</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/525-4
01:57:12.744 --> 01:57:16.299
<v Josh Sparkes>think basically is offering to response
either link but I have.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/526-0
01:57:16.659 --> 01:57:22.108
<v Josh Sparkes>50 from bullying and 20 from from our for
example, and I become your doctor.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/526-1
01:57:22.108 --> 01:57:25.363
<v Josh Sparkes>Like basically we all of them on perfect
day.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/526-2
01:57:25.363 --> 01:57:31.025
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think that makes the team on their
team and who do they say these are from</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/526-3
01:57:31.025 --> 01:57:35.979
<v Josh Sparkes>your stage before it's the challenge we
have is it's just definitely.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/528-0
01:57:36.179 --> 01:57:40.245
<v Josh Sparkes>Say offering.
But then you've got no say over and I'm</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/528-1
01:57:40.245 --> 01:57:43.859
<v Josh Sparkes>assuming we don't have any awareness to
put on.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/528-2
01:57:43.859 --> 01:57:47.699
<v Josh Sparkes>We think that's it's difficult with
samples in .7.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/529-0
01:57:57.059 --> 01:58:03.132
<v Josh Sparkes>The problem is shipped to Kamina,
but I'm the bottleneck rather than that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/529-1
01:58:03.132 --> 01:58:09.369
<v Josh Sparkes>Sydney's actually so in a point at the
end of when I have paper I was I was</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/529-2
01:58:09.369 --> 01:58:11.339
<v Josh Sparkes>going to say you may go.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/530-0
01:58:11.499 --> 01:58:11.779
<v Josh Sparkes>Simple.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/531-0
01:58:12.219 --> 01:58:17.380
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's when we build it. It's not like,
no, it's a good particular.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/531-1
01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:22.106
<v Josh Sparkes>Then you look at that,
I think that's a good point you're making</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/531-2
01:58:22.106 --> 01:58:28.067
<v Josh Sparkes>what Julian's seen is this is first thing
off, right. So it gave you for stories.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/531-3
01:58:28.067 --> 01:58:31.339
<v Josh Sparkes>It's to kill something.
I'm not saying that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/532-0
01:58:33.099 --> 01:58:38.151
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
we're probably actually get in the same</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/532-1
01:58:38.151 --> 01:58:44.151
<v Josh Sparkes>place, but yeah,
it's really a savings for you to really</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/532-2
01:58:44.151 --> 01:58:51.099
<v Josh Sparkes>say not how we're filmed in it,
and that's where you're not sure.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/533-0
01:58:56.499 --> 01:59:00.991
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll provide like a a set of stories for
you to agree. Once that's review, we OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/533-1
01:59:00.991 --> 01:59:05.213
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a good set for us going to take
away and start to just build it up and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/533-2
01:59:05.213 --> 01:59:09.056
<v Josh Sparkes>start to look what it looks like.
So we take that into our on a Sprint</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/533-3
01:59:09.056 --> 01:59:11.979
<v Josh Sparkes>which is a two week site and then demo
that function.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/534-0
01:59:14.099 --> 01:59:16.589
<v Josh Sparkes>Actually, yeah,
that's exactly what I wanted.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/534-1
01:59:16.589 --> 01:59:20.649
<v Josh Sparkes>It's good to go. So actually, no,
some of those things aren't in the light</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/534-2
01:59:20.649 --> 01:59:24.655
<v Josh Sparkes>for us because of the investors.
Can you change some of the significance?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/534-3
01:59:24.655 --> 01:59:27.579
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, so thinking unions and get user cases,
right? So.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/535-0
01:59:28.299 --> 01:59:32.271
<v Josh Sparkes>Think one. You're giving me 50 users?
Yeah, right. I've been up to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/535-1
01:59:32.271 --> 01:59:36.653
<v Josh Sparkes>That's where it should be. Yeah.
And now it means that you don't think you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/535-2
01:59:36.653 --> 01:59:41.035
<v Josh Sparkes>said that batch you did that batch.
You will put it in this version. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/535-3
01:59:41.035 --> 01:59:44.598
<v Josh Sparkes>How long does it take for those fifty
tests to be completed?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/535-4
01:59:44.598 --> 01:59:46.059
<v Josh Sparkes>So depending on the this.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/536-0
01:59:46.619 --> 01:59:51.496
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll have to take some people that can
find that accident across the other. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/536-1
01:59:51.496 --> 01:59:54.141
<v Josh Sparkes>let's say let's. Well,
let's say it takes 4.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/536-2
01:59:54.141 --> 01:59:57.843
<v Josh Sparkes>Some of those stories will be directed in
the first two weeks.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/536-3
01:59:57.843 --> 02:00:02.485
<v Josh Sparkes>The next set was the next two weeks.
Just put me into so you have an option to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/536-4
02:00:02.485 --> 02:00:05.659
<v Josh Sparkes>start with you every two weeks.
You've got one month.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/537-0
02:00:06.619 --> 02:00:13.610
<v Josh Sparkes>And then yeah,
but we'll have every two weeks,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/537-1
02:00:13.610 --> 02:00:25.659
<v Josh Sparkes>so that it may not be to feel 30. Yeah.
So so you will. So so you will so so so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/538-0
02:00:25.699 --> 02:00:30.551
<v Josh Sparkes>So I guess a bit more conflict was you
were and then across all our versions of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/538-1
02:00:30.551 --> 02:00:34.919
<v Josh Sparkes>all the several approvals and
prioritisation and everything that really</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/538-2
02:00:34.919 --> 02:00:38.983
<v Josh Sparkes>that's the most important,
that sort of foundation still is having</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/538-3
02:00:38.983 --> 02:00:41.713
<v Josh Sparkes>the.
So there's a little bit more complex in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/538-4
02:00:41.713 --> 02:00:42.259
<v Josh Sparkes>that but.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/540-0
02:00:42.939 --> 02:00:49.082
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll have a good set functions that you
can start. Yeah, within two weeks.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/540-1
02:00:49.082 --> 02:00:55.467
<v Josh Sparkes>And then there's next set functions.
So basically you're just you're splitting</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/540-2
02:00:55.467 --> 02:00:59.912
<v Josh Sparkes>as an example,
so you're not going to give 100 stories</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/540-3
02:00:59.912 --> 02:01:02.499
<v Josh Sparkes>you'll give me, but you're also.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/541-0
02:01:02.699 --> 02:01:06.757
<v Josh Sparkes>And do that. They're. Yeah,
they said probably because say for</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/541-1
02:01:06.757 --> 02:01:10.751
<v Josh Sparkes>example 50 user cases users for these
people to get the test,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/541-2
02:01:10.751 --> 02:01:15.904
<v Josh Sparkes>but then there might be out of those 50
remaining there might be 10 or 15 which</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/541-3
02:01:15.904 --> 02:01:19.704
<v Josh Sparkes>are in the length with of course the
security. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/541-4
02:01:19.704 --> 02:01:22.539
<v Josh Sparkes>So obviously going to see whether it
works.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/542-0
02:01:22.699 --> 02:01:26.787
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's one of the things and that's
why we will have to go.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/542-1
02:01:26.787 --> 02:01:31.200
<v Josh Sparkes>These are standard stories, really easy,
simple facts to know know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/542-2
02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:35.483
<v Josh Sparkes>but some would be like,
that's just you don't have to worry about</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/542-3
02:01:35.483 --> 02:01:40.220
<v Josh Sparkes>all the others. Some of those. Yes.
But there's a depending story and we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/542-4
02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:41.259
<v Josh Sparkes>don't want that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/543-0
02:01:42.579 --> 02:01:48.917
<v Josh Sparkes>So we're ready to spend that when we in
the major, we'll need something.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/543-1
02:01:48.917 --> 02:01:54.647
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll give you. But yeah,
I also need to sign off buying some from</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/543-2
02:01:54.647 --> 02:01:57.339
<v Josh Sparkes>other SMB this process as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/544-0
02:01:57.939 --> 02:02:02.081
<v Josh Sparkes>So we just need to kind of build some
that interest season and what we'll do is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/544-1
02:02:02.081 --> 02:02:05.964
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll say we could, we can mark it.
So that is a dependent story and we'll</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/544-2
02:02:05.964 --> 02:02:09.951
<v Josh Sparkes>have the the breadth of equipment as you
are and get 2SMS with that session.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/544-3
02:02:09.951 --> 02:02:13.575
<v Josh Sparkes>So then we can do that for free for our
testimony that has been done.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/544-4
02:02:13.575 --> 02:02:17.459
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think for me from a resource
perspective, we've also been looking at.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/545-0
02:02:29.779 --> 02:02:37.059
<v Josh Sparkes>That's that's savage, that's why.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/546-0
02:02:37.499 --> 02:02:39.019
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, we need to be savings.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/548-0
02:02:42.099 --> 02:02:47.327
<v Josh Sparkes>All the speeches that you have exams and
we think what feels weak is that there</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/548-1
02:02:47.327 --> 02:02:49.419
<v Josh Sparkes>can be anything, it's Julie say.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/549-0
02:03:02.739 --> 02:03:11.124
<v Josh Sparkes>I feel I feel the bite in my Charles and
then I think that mine's up here. Oh,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/549-1
02:03:11.124 --> 02:03:13.459
<v Josh Sparkes>is it? I'll take that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/550-0
02:03:29.379 --> 02:03:29.459
<v Josh Sparkes>I.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/551-0
02:03:35.579 --> 02:03:40.732
<v Josh Sparkes>We can't.
What we can do is we can say so as far as</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/551-1
02:03:40.732 --> 02:03:46.975
<v Josh Sparkes>you don't want to just run the stores
that I asked them to do,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/551-2
02:03:46.975 --> 02:03:53.219
<v Josh Sparkes>that's no pending story forces springs.
We've got queen. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/552-0
02:03:56.419 --> 02:04:07.097
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, it should come.
As I said through 3D, yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/552-1
02:04:07.097 --> 02:04:13.699
<v Josh Sparkes>sometimes we get the request from.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/553-0
02:04:14.219 --> 02:04:18.428
<v Josh Sparkes>He wants to share. Well, yeah.
But we actually push back. OK, good. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/553-1
02:04:18.428 --> 02:04:21.158
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's great.
That's always what it sounds.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/553-2
02:04:21.158 --> 02:04:25.879
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we just the you have to you have
to everything else to sort of say that we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/553-3
02:04:25.879 --> 02:04:30.487
<v Josh Sparkes>can push back and write a single that's a
person and it could be that if you put</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/553-4
02:04:30.487 --> 02:04:32.819
<v Josh Sparkes>back some of the new query for any forms.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/554-0
02:04:34.219 --> 02:04:34.899
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/555-0
02:04:40.819 --> 02:04:46.939
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that's it. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/556-0
02:05:04.259 --> 02:05:06.619
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that's what.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/558-0
02:05:06.899 --> 02:05:10.122
<v Josh Sparkes>So at that point it's too late because
it's already been.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/558-1
02:05:10.122 --> 02:05:13.901
<v Josh Sparkes>So basically mostly short.
What she's looking for is because people</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/558-2
02:05:13.901 --> 02:05:17.013
<v Josh Sparkes>are saying didn't save the question at
the 1st 8:00 PM,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/558-3
02:05:17.013 --> 02:05:21.293
<v Josh Sparkes>six PM expecting it to be a bit away,
but obviously there's a bit of a delay</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/558-4
02:05:21.293 --> 02:05:25.739
<v Josh Sparkes>you're logging on and then the team log,
the Glasgow team logging on the model.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/559-0
02:05:26.779 --> 02:05:27.299
<v Josh Sparkes>Recent ones.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/560-0
02:05:27.299 --> 02:05:31.393
<v Josh Sparkes>To make it to to the customers that when
to expect to reply the problem we've got</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/560-1
02:05:31.393 --> 02:05:34.887
<v Josh Sparkes>right now is what we don't have a
notification turned on for when the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/560-2
02:05:34.887 --> 02:05:37.983
<v Josh Sparkes>device is submitted,
which ideally we would put you know that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/560-3
02:05:37.983 --> 02:05:41.228
<v Josh Sparkes>by hours within that, Yep,
it's at the assigned bit which is too</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/560-4
02:05:41.228 --> 02:05:43.524
<v Josh Sparkes>late,
it's already assigned to something that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/560-5
02:05:43.524 --> 02:05:46.719
<v Josh Sparkes>will likely get picked up.
So I was just wondering like is that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/560-6
02:05:46.719 --> 02:05:47.219
<v Josh Sparkes>something?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/561-0
02:05:47.539 --> 02:05:51.401
<v Josh Sparkes>What we could like to do,
like we may have some sort of word,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/561-1
02:05:51.401 --> 02:05:56.633
<v Josh Sparkes>another and roses to us when they can not
exactly when they can expect that exactly</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/561-2
02:05:56.633 --> 02:05:59.997
<v Josh Sparkes>on the request that think about it in
further detail.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/561-3
02:05:59.997 --> 02:06:03.299
<v Josh Sparkes>But I just thought I'd mention it because
spoke one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/562-0
02:06:04.739 --> 02:06:06.711
<v Josh Sparkes>BFG,
who are managed service at the moment,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/562-1
02:06:06.711 --> 02:06:10.387
<v Josh Sparkes>but because ask are set up and that way
where we don't have the same notification</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/562-2
02:06:10.387 --> 02:06:12.136
<v Josh Sparkes>on,
they're also reluctant to touch it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/562-3
02:06:12.136 --> 02:06:15.677
<v Josh Sparkes>because it's attached to incident and
we're only able to use the instant right</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/562-4
02:06:15.677 --> 02:06:17.650
<v Josh Sparkes>now it's causing quite a lot of
advantages,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/562-5
02:06:17.650 --> 02:06:20.922
<v Josh Sparkes>so we kind of want to avoid that.
We agree we're so we're kind of Part 2</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/562-6
02:06:20.922 --> 02:06:24.419
<v Josh Sparkes>for just now and I thought it's maybe
something we can involve ourselves now.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/563-0
02:06:26.979 --> 02:06:30.018
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be that on submission you get
this.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/563-1
02:06:30.018 --> 02:06:35.219
<v Josh Sparkes>You know it comes up and it's been and
there's A and there's all at the time</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/563-2
02:06:35.219 --> 02:06:39.745
<v Josh Sparkes>that they're doing it before it's
submitted, they get this prompt.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/563-3
02:06:39.745 --> 02:06:41.299
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just talking about.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/564-0
02:06:43.059 --> 02:06:43.139
<v Josh Sparkes>It.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/565-0
02:06:46.979 --> 02:06:51.726
<v Josh Sparkes>Expectation. Yeah,
because there's no submitting</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/565-1
02:06:51.726 --> 02:06:59.379
<v Josh Sparkes>notification point that they get assigned.
So I was just wondering if because.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/566-0
02:07:02.379 --> 02:07:07.479
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just thinking I'm going to give you
my notes. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/566-1
02:07:07.479 --> 02:07:12.358
<v Josh Sparkes>So actually close that.
And our time at 8 O clock in the morning.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/566-2
02:07:12.358 --> 02:07:17.016
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's no one on to 911-1510 clock St
in the morning. Yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/566-3
02:07:17.016 --> 02:07:19.899
<v Josh Sparkes>that means we'll be requesting through.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/567-0
02:07:20.299 --> 02:07:24.812
<v Josh Sparkes>And I'm seeing things as well in Glasgow
to close at 5:30,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/567-1
02:07:24.812 --> 02:07:28.254
<v Josh Sparkes>there is an expectation you could
Singapore.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/567-2
02:07:28.254 --> 02:07:33.379
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got all the other countries that
expect a response as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/568-0
02:07:40.019 --> 02:07:43.632
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, or they go submits. Yeah,
it could be a pop up.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/568-1
02:07:43.632 --> 02:07:48.179
<v Josh Sparkes>You know that you get a prompt. Yeah.
And we can talk about the standard</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/568-2
02:07:48.179 --> 02:07:53.224
<v Josh Sparkes>because all queries and particularly one.
Yeah, sometimes that they're informed.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/568-3
02:07:53.224 --> 02:07:56.339
<v Josh Sparkes>So isn't there isn't an assumption.
I've done it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/569-0
02:07:56.699 --> 02:08:01.589
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, and you've got work in as well,
don't you?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/569-1
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:09.772
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got work in the best that just in
the way it was. Send it through tickets.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/569-2
02:08:09.772 --> 02:08:16.259
<v Josh Sparkes>We're getting through. Yes. Whatever.
So you may not flush that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/570-0
02:08:21.019 --> 02:08:24.118
<v Josh Sparkes>Because later there's an assumption that
expectations,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/570-1
02:08:24.118 --> 02:08:27.105
<v Josh Sparkes>so they're not coming into numerous
chasers, though,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/570-2
02:08:27.105 --> 02:08:30.824
<v Josh Sparkes>that like I see right now,
we can't really do anything because of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/570-3
02:08:30.824 --> 02:08:32.459
<v Josh Sparkes>the way that it's set up and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/571-0
02:08:32.899 --> 02:08:36.163
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll see what you have on.
That's the images and jumping.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/571-1
02:08:36.163 --> 02:08:40.422
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think that is across all people's
work and we all have had it all come.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/571-2
02:08:40.422 --> 02:08:43.354
<v Josh Sparkes>If I do it,
I've got this to do and it's always like</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/571-3
02:08:43.354 --> 02:08:46.729
<v Josh Sparkes>I've thrown the owner of offence.
Can you throw it back yet?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/571-4
02:08:46.729 --> 02:08:48.499
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's not like you need that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/572-0
02:08:48.859 --> 02:08:51.307
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
leading time that you know that when</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/572-1
02:08:51.307 --> 02:08:54.324
<v Josh Sparkes>you're younger and then maybe the next
time is well,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/572-2
02:08:54.324 --> 02:08:57.626
<v Josh Sparkes>if I gave it to you at 12 or if I gave
you, oh, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/572-3
02:08:57.626 --> 02:09:01.896
<v Josh Sparkes>if I gave it to the point that I knew,
then it would make like a lot. Yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/572-4
02:09:01.896 --> 02:09:05.939
<v Josh Sparkes>It was basically before I said slipping
it's if you're standing there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/573-0
02:09:06.579 --> 02:09:13.972
<v Josh Sparkes>So and you've got a two and you've got a
two delay. We've got anybody from? Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/573-1
02:09:13.972 --> 02:09:20.013
<v Josh Sparkes>we can set that. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks.
Pick that up. Thank you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/573-2
02:09:20.013 --> 02:09:22.899
<v Josh Sparkes>All the dress drawing discounts.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/575-0
02:09:23.299 --> 02:09:27.339
<v Josh Sparkes>Everyone on the floor can hear us to that
front, hear us and see us.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/574-0
02:09:28.139 --> 02:09:30.059
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, all good. Yeah, we can hear you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/576-0
02:09:33.579 --> 02:09:39.543
<v Josh Sparkes>And manage volume distance. Yeah.
Is it in the same place by that?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/576-1
02:09:39.543 --> 02:09:44.974
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that the rest of us?
I said don't you've got paid by only</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/576-2
02:09:44.974 --> 02:09:48.179
<v Josh Sparkes>discounts. It's the rest of us. But.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/578-0
02:09:49.939 --> 02:09:55.943
<v Josh Sparkes>What we have to do is not to.
It's just there's a big education piece</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/578-1
02:09:55.943 --> 02:10:01.775
<v Josh Sparkes>around the volume discounts.
So I'll give you an idea with a volume</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/578-2
02:10:01.775 --> 02:10:07.779
<v Josh Sparkes>discount is kind of touched already is
where our client has hit that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/579-0
02:10:08.459 --> 02:10:11.630
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.
And what they're seeing is when they hit</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/579-1
02:10:11.630 --> 02:10:15.353
<v Josh Sparkes>that threshold,
they want a 5% discount on any bills.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/579-2
02:10:15.353 --> 02:10:20.938
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we've hit the next threshold,
they want a 10% etcetera or alternatively</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/579-3
02:10:20.938 --> 02:10:25.212
<v Josh Sparkes>they'll need actually one.
There's other ways they can do it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/579-4
02:10:25.212 --> 02:10:27.419
<v Josh Sparkes>They need one for the full year.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/580-0
02:10:28.019 --> 02:10:31.795
<v Josh Sparkes>And then to be reviews and then they want
a rebate.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/580-1
02:10:31.795 --> 02:10:37.896
<v Josh Sparkes>Basically the rebate could be in the form
of credit or it could be in form of sorry</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/580-2
02:10:37.896 --> 02:10:43.125
<v Josh Sparkes>cash back or editors going forward.
So there's different ways of volume</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/580-3
02:10:43.125 --> 02:10:43.779
<v Josh Sparkes>discount.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/581-0
02:10:44.459 --> 02:10:49.454
<v Josh Sparkes>A volume discount be a straightforward
percentage discount. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/581-1
02:10:49.454 --> 02:10:54.753
<v Josh Sparkes>And what we just spoke about,
so 10 percent, 20% or alternative over,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/581-2
02:10:54.753 --> 02:10:59.219
<v Josh Sparkes>just go back over in the pecking date
from now to now. So.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/582-0
02:11:00.379 --> 02:11:05.248
<v Josh Sparkes>Billing is 500,000, so from this point,
the 120 percent,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/582-1
02:11:05.248 --> 02:11:10.032
<v Josh Sparkes>10% discount and we put that in awfully
effective date.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/582-2
02:11:10.032 --> 02:11:16.952
<v Josh Sparkes>And then when we hit next threshold we
want the next 15 percent 20% discount and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/582-3
02:11:16.952 --> 02:11:19.259
<v Josh Sparkes>we can put that into three.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/583-0
02:11:20.579 --> 02:11:24.571
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's the agreement upfront that
could be only set up as part of, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/583-1
02:11:24.571 --> 02:11:28.143
<v Josh Sparkes>And it sets up that these thresholds that
you would discount. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/583-2
02:11:28.143 --> 02:11:32.346
<v Josh Sparkes>And then what would happen is the in on
the bill where the client would see the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/583-3
02:11:32.346 --> 02:11:35.183
<v Josh Sparkes>fill rates,
what has been charged and then you'll see</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/583-4
02:11:35.183 --> 02:11:37.179
<v Josh Sparkes>a straightforward whatever percentage.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/585-0
02:11:37.459 --> 02:11:41.636
<v Josh Sparkes>Off that bill.
So that's one way of doing it and another</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/585-1
02:11:41.636 --> 02:11:45.373
<v Josh Sparkes>way that it's done.
It's a totally bit of rebates,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/585-2
02:11:45.373 --> 02:11:49.844
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's actual rates.
So we've got one client in particular</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/585-3
02:11:49.844 --> 02:11:53.435
<v Josh Sparkes>where it's the threshold and the one 2%
off off,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/584-0
02:11:51.619 --> 02:11:51.739
<v Parik>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/585-4
02:11:53.435 --> 02:11:57.099
<v Josh Sparkes>but not off the bill they want the rates
reduced.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/586-0
02:11:57.379 --> 02:12:03.284
<v Josh Sparkes>So then we have to get and reduce every
single rate pass by 2% and then 2.4%.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/586-1
02:12:03.284 --> 02:12:07.600
<v Josh Sparkes>So if we start because of the highlight
keyboard client,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/586-2
02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:13.960
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be that at that point I mean you
might not touch that set up by compliant.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/586-3
02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:16.459
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that So what should happen is?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/587-0
02:12:17.059 --> 02:12:21.264
<v Josh Sparkes>And so they're on board.
There's a new client or or it's a review.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/587-1
02:12:21.264 --> 02:12:25.594
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, a review. So no reason.
And and this will be a discount and on</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/587-2
02:12:25.594 --> 02:12:30.176
<v Josh Sparkes>and then it should all be in that
engagement later compliance will be no</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/587-3
02:12:30.176 --> 02:12:32.059
<v Josh Sparkes>about it. Yeah. Thanks lindas.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/588-0
02:12:32.739 --> 02:12:37.258
<v Josh Sparkes>No, they don't know it.
They they just know about it and and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/588-1
02:12:37.258 --> 02:12:41.703
<v Josh Sparkes>often and then we have queries and that's
what it comes in,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/588-2
02:12:41.703 --> 02:12:47.630
<v Josh Sparkes>how we come across it is we may be asked
to change the rates and they happen to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/588-3
02:12:47.630 --> 02:12:49.779
<v Josh Sparkes>attach the engagement letter.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/589-0
02:12:50.819 --> 02:12:55.389
<v Josh Sparkes>In which case we'll look through it.
You can see it, and that's quite hard,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/589-1
02:12:55.389 --> 02:12:57.854
<v Josh Sparkes>though,
because it could be 100 pages or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/589-2
02:12:57.854 --> 02:13:00.681
<v Josh Sparkes>something,
so we could be trying to find avoid</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/589-3
02:13:00.681 --> 02:13:05.612
<v Josh Sparkes>discount there trying to look through it
or what will happen is there's a mess up</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/589-4
02:13:05.612 --> 02:13:08.739
<v Josh Sparkes>the bill and then they suddenly realise
it was not.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/590-0
02:13:09.099 --> 02:13:12.985
<v Josh Sparkes>Told us anything about volume discount
and then we have to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/590-1
02:13:12.985 --> 02:13:17.714
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's not very good how we receive that
information. OK at the moment.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/590-2
02:13:17.714 --> 02:13:21.601
<v Josh Sparkes>So what I would like to see is when it's
a panel agreement,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/590-3
02:13:21.601 --> 02:13:23.739
<v Josh Sparkes>when we come to panel agreements.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/591-0
02:13:24.899 --> 02:13:27.845
<v Josh Sparkes>When the request comes in,
that should be on there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/591-1
02:13:27.845 --> 02:13:31.754
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there a volume discount?
There should be some something there and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/591-2
02:13:31.754 --> 02:13:36.003
<v Josh Sparkes>to make them aware because it's very
difficult for a team member to either</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/591-3
02:13:36.003 --> 02:13:38.779
<v Josh Sparkes>look through an engagement letter if it's
there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/592-0
02:13:41.179 --> 02:13:44.591
<v Josh Sparkes>All these pages wrong.
The main is that or often we don't even</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/592-1
02:13:44.591 --> 02:13:48.491
<v Josh Sparkes>get the engagement where they just tell
us the rates anyway. So what's,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/592-2
02:13:48.491 --> 02:13:51.145
<v Josh Sparkes>as you said,
there's probably an education page,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/592-3
02:13:51.145 --> 02:13:54.179
<v Josh Sparkes>but I mean also the fact that it does
land review, yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/592-4
02:13:54.179 --> 02:13:58.512
<v Josh Sparkes>we have them often at various levels.
So it could be that you get the few times</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/592-5
02:13:58.512 --> 02:13:59.379
<v Josh Sparkes>that there is a.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/593-0
02:14:00.539 --> 02:14:06.489
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean difficult, but any level,
would it be it's level or at maximum</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/593-1
02:14:06.489 --> 02:14:11.419
<v Josh Sparkes>level and level?
I would say the majority is client level</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/593-2
02:14:11.419 --> 02:14:16.859
<v Josh Sparkes>and or it could be a bit higher ultimate
clients that could be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/594-0
02:14:18.059 --> 02:14:22.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, they're all client numbers.
They're all together and all the bills</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/594-1
02:14:22.537 --> 02:14:25.237
<v Josh Sparkes>for big client numbers are massed
together.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/594-2
02:14:25.237 --> 02:14:29.225
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be that and the IT can be a bit
more complex than that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/594-3
02:14:29.225 --> 02:14:33.028
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes it's just for particular
matters. And in that case,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/594-4
02:14:33.028 --> 02:14:36.219
<v Josh Sparkes>we need to get asked.
Reporting to help us because.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/595-0
02:14:36.539 --> 02:14:41.095
<v Josh Sparkes>3 doesn't have that.
Who raises it for you today?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/595-1
02:14:41.095 --> 02:14:45.287
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be the PE.
It should be the partner.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/595-2
02:14:45.287 --> 02:14:50.300
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be the global commercial team as
well. Quite,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/595-3
02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:55.859
<v Josh Sparkes>quite often it could be the senior
account manager. So yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/596-0
02:14:55.939 --> 02:14:58.977
<v Josh Sparkes>And then no, I'm just saying it.
It could be the. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/596-1
02:14:58.977 --> 02:15:03.208
<v Josh Sparkes>It'll be a client relationship managers.
What business managers who deal with</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/596-2
02:15:03.208 --> 02:15:06.083
<v Josh Sparkes>specific clients.
It could come from anywhere. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/596-3
02:15:06.083 --> 02:15:09.392
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can come in, like, again,
this form could be leaving.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/596-4
02:15:09.392 --> 02:15:11.779
<v Josh Sparkes>So it could be.
What do you want to change?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/598-0
02:15:12.219 --> 02:15:15.853
<v Josh Sparkes>Basically,
client matter eight and only what they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/598-1
02:15:15.853 --> 02:15:21.957
<v Josh Sparkes>choose you. They get this education piece,
so it could be if it's matter the number</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/598-2
02:15:21.957 --> 02:15:27.699
<v Josh Sparkes>that we talked about which is 4 to that
validation and you could then receive.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/599-0
02:15:27.979 --> 02:15:32.625
<v Josh Sparkes>We can go through that sort of details
what you would like to see or checklist</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/599-1
02:15:32.625 --> 02:15:37.447
<v Josh Sparkes>cover those scenarios and get it leading
and so only it's not something so we can</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/599-2
02:15:37.447 --> 02:15:41.093
<v Josh Sparkes>show a few cheques,
but at least there is a a piece that they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/599-3
02:15:41.093 --> 02:15:45.798
<v Josh Sparkes>have to input report plans for yourself.
So it's all just going back and forth.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/599-4
02:15:45.798 --> 02:15:47.739
<v Josh Sparkes>This gets the difficulty we have.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/600-0
02:15:48.259 --> 02:15:52.099
<v Josh Sparkes>Is not, as I said earlier,
we're not always made aware of them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/600-1
02:15:52.099 --> 02:15:56.359
<v Josh Sparkes>So sometimes PE and the partner are
actually tracking that themselves.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/600-2
02:15:56.359 --> 02:15:59.719
<v Josh Sparkes>So they track their bills when it hits a
certain point,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/600-3
02:15:59.719 --> 02:16:03.439
<v Josh Sparkes>we will just send an e-mail out and ask
us to add a discount.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/600-4
02:16:03.439 --> 02:16:07.339
<v Josh Sparkes>We're not aware it's actually a volume.
This doesn't matter how.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/602-0
02:16:07.579 --> 02:16:10.510
<v Josh Sparkes>And added in,
but we we're just not made aware of it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/602-1
02:16:10.510 --> 02:16:14.689
<v Josh Sparkes>So if we get any queries about that,
we will see there's no volume discount.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/602-2
02:16:14.689 --> 02:16:18.597
<v Josh Sparkes>People just told us we know there's a
discount. Education pieces. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/602-3
02:16:18.597 --> 02:16:22.939
<v Josh Sparkes>it's the fact that they found the error
because the discount wasn't applied or.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/603-0
02:16:23.419 --> 02:16:28.140
<v Josh Sparkes>But it still comes under. Yeah,
it's it's how these requests point.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/603-1
02:16:28.140 --> 02:16:33.555
<v Josh Sparkes>This Council is very messy and I can
understand why you can explain the three</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/603-2
02:16:33.555 --> 02:16:39.179
<v Josh Sparkes>teams involved as well and why they're
involved like depths us and us reporting.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/605-0
02:16:39.899 --> 02:16:43.469
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've got, well,
we're trying to be working with the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/605-1
02:16:43.469 --> 02:16:48.762
<v Josh Sparkes>client commitments team as well and this
is fairly yeah, this is fairly new, yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/605-2
02:16:48.762 --> 02:16:53.735
<v Josh Sparkes>so but this is more just to do with
because we're aware there's an issue with</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/605-3
02:16:53.735 --> 02:16:57.306
<v Josh Sparkes>voting discounts.
We're we're trying to capture it from</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/605-4
02:16:57.306 --> 02:16:59.219
<v Josh Sparkes>everywhere client commitments.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/606-0
02:16:59.299 --> 02:17:03.850
<v Josh Sparkes>These team are more likely to get
engagement letters and more likely to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/606-1
02:17:03.850 --> 02:17:07.580
<v Josh Sparkes>have more information,
so they are now letting us know the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/606-2
02:17:07.580 --> 02:17:10.804
<v Josh Sparkes>upstream people that probably know about
it first.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/606-3
02:17:10.804 --> 02:17:14.723
<v Josh Sparkes>In fact lights eventually they should do.
Yeah, we should do.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/606-4
02:17:14.723 --> 02:17:18.579
<v Josh Sparkes>And obviously ourselves.
And then the ask reporting team so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/607-0
02:17:19.219 --> 02:17:22.247
<v Josh Sparkes>And the reason they are supporting this
thing,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/607-1
02:17:22.247 --> 02:17:27.466
<v Josh Sparkes>I think I touched on earlier is if it's a
basic you know all the client numbers,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/607-2
02:17:27.466 --> 02:17:31.977
<v Josh Sparkes>we're hitting this threshold,
then we'll take that off and then we'll</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/607-3
02:17:31.977 --> 02:17:34.619
<v Josh Sparkes>get the discount and that's fine if it's.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/608-0
02:17:35.299 --> 02:17:39.869
<v Josh Sparkes>It's only these matters or it's only for
a certain type of work.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/608-1
02:17:39.869 --> 02:17:45.353
<v Josh Sparkes>Then we're only able to manage that.
And then that's what ask reporting would</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/608-2
02:17:45.353 --> 02:17:49.080
<v Josh Sparkes>manage that.
But then they would come to us and say,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/608-3
02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:53.299
<v Josh Sparkes>can you never apply a discount?
So essentially the landing.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/611-0
02:17:54.259 --> 02:17:59.922
<v Josh Sparkes>Pace of change still comes back around.
It's actually, yeah, but we've got those.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/609-0
02:17:59.179 --> 02:17:59.379
<v Mark Sedge>Hello.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/611-1
02:17:59.922 --> 02:18:02.339
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got those. Is that mark? Yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/613-0
02:18:02.099 --> 02:18:06.439
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. Sorry, just sorry.
I'm just just sort of tracking back.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/613-1
02:18:06.439 --> 02:18:10.849
<v Mark Sedge>So this is arguably,
is this not just a single request open to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/612-0
02:18:08.459 --> 02:18:08.579
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/613-2
02:18:10.849 --> 02:18:16.449
<v Mark Sedge>a broader community and depending on the
parameters of the context of what they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/613-3
02:18:16.449 --> 02:18:19.599
<v Mark Sedge>want,
it then routes to either the reporting</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/613-4
02:18:19.599 --> 02:18:21.419
<v Mark Sedge>task to reporting team or?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/615-0
02:18:21.739 --> 02:18:26.674
<v Mark Sedge>To these guys or whatever, you know,
is it if we're looking for the portal and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/614-0
02:18:23.859 --> 02:18:23.979
<v Josh Sparkes>Right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/615-1
02:18:26.674 --> 02:18:30.734
<v Mark Sedge>I just want to confirm because I may have
missed it that we are,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/615-2
02:18:30.734 --> 02:18:35.607
<v Mark Sedge>we're treating this as a request that
folks will go in and raise via employee</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/615-3
02:18:35.607 --> 02:18:37.419
<v Mark Sedge>centre through to these guys.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/616-0
02:18:38.019 --> 02:18:38.819
<v Mark Sedge>Or you know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/617-0
02:18:38.939 --> 02:18:41.643
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So volume discount will land with Rama.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/617-1
02:18:41.643 --> 02:18:45.463
<v Josh Sparkes>In order to do the works,
but it's our negotiated with doing the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/617-2
02:18:45.463 --> 02:18:48.167
<v Josh Sparkes>work,
but we're just discussing who knew what</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/617-3
02:18:48.167 --> 02:18:52.870
<v Josh Sparkes>first in order to raise that request.
And yeah, and there's a bit more to that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/617-4
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:56.397
<v Josh Sparkes>So this is just the request at the moment.
So you're right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/617-5
02:18:56.397 --> 02:18:58.219
<v Josh Sparkes>So basically it should just be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/618-0
02:18:58.339 --> 02:19:03.770
<v Josh Sparkes>We get a request to read aware and it may
just update the CE for for the change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/618-1
02:19:03.770 --> 02:19:07.055
<v Josh Sparkes>However,
it's the tracking and the monitoring of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/618-2
02:19:07.055 --> 02:19:12.285
<v Josh Sparkes>this and has been made aware of it so
reporting team may be tracking some and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/618-3
02:19:12.285 --> 02:19:14.699
<v Josh Sparkes>then they will ask us to to do this.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/619-0
02:19:15.099 --> 02:19:17.899
<v Josh Sparkes>The PES or some some?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/621-0
02:19:15.939 --> 02:19:20.177
<v Mark Sedge>I think sorry. Forgive me,
this is I think this is the point, right?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/621-1
02:19:20.177 --> 02:19:23.187
<v Mark Sedge>Who whoever's interested in will be
tracking it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/621-2
02:19:23.187 --> 02:19:27.672
<v Mark Sedge>If they launched the if they triggered
the request and if we sort of got</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/621-3
02:19:27.672 --> 02:19:31.419
<v Mark Sedge>everyone to sort of work aligned to
triggering that request.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/620-0
02:19:31.099 --> 02:19:31.699
<v Josh Sparkes>Mm-hmm.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/624-0
02:19:31.779 --> 02:19:35.041
<v Mark Sedge>Then the traceability of it's going
through where it is,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/624-1
02:19:35.041 --> 02:19:39.048
<v Mark Sedge>what's happening with the etcetera would
all be part of that request.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/624-2
02:19:39.048 --> 02:19:42.025
<v Mark Sedge>It would remove some complexity.
I'm just thinking,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/622-0
02:19:41.539 --> 02:19:41.899
<v Josh Sparkes>So.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/624-3
02:19:42.025 --> 02:19:45.059
<v Mark Sedge>is there an opportunity to go on, Sandeep,
go ahead.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/623-0
02:19:44.059 --> 02:19:44.419
<v Josh Sparkes>Back.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/625-0
02:19:45.939 --> 02:19:49.413
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
Can I just suggest we have spent a lot of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/625-1
02:19:49.413 --> 02:19:53.033
<v Josh Sparkes>time, lot,
lot of weeks and months on this one we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/625-2
02:19:53.033 --> 02:19:58.607
<v Josh Sparkes>with the help of Jill and Kinga's team,
we have mapped out the entire volume</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/625-3
02:19:58.607 --> 02:20:00.779
<v Josh Sparkes>discount process what we know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/626-0
02:20:01.499 --> 02:20:04.755
<v Josh Sparkes>Including the people's involved gaps and
everything,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/626-1
02:20:04.755 --> 02:20:09.486
<v Josh Sparkes>gap analysis and impact assessment and
everything is done. I don't think so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/626-2
02:20:09.486 --> 02:20:14.401
<v Josh Sparkes>It would be ideal for us to solutionize
this because we don't have the solution</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/626-3
02:20:14.401 --> 02:20:18.271
<v Josh Sparkes>right now ourselves,
but essentially the query still lies with</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/626-4
02:20:18.271 --> 02:20:20.299
<v Josh Sparkes>at the end of the day, yes, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/627-0
02:20:20.819 --> 02:20:24.391
<v Josh Sparkes>Because the mark,
you're absolutely right the the root</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/627-1
02:20:24.391 --> 02:20:29.457
<v Josh Sparkes>cause is that who is doing what or who
holds that ownership accountability of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/627-2
02:20:29.457 --> 02:20:32.380
<v Josh Sparkes>that information.
That is very much unclear.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/627-3
02:20:32.380 --> 02:20:37.381
<v Josh Sparkes>So right now what we know is that OK,
we get a set of clients, we manage it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/627-4
02:20:37.381 --> 02:20:40.499
<v Josh Sparkes>we ask reporting gets it,
you know CMD gets it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/628-0
02:20:40.859 --> 02:20:43.404
<v Josh Sparkes>All of them.
The good thing is that we have</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/628-1
02:20:43.404 --> 02:20:46.296
<v Josh Sparkes>centralised it.
We have created a place that, OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/628-2
02:20:46.296 --> 02:20:50.692
<v Josh Sparkes>if you are getting a couple of client
changes you make sure you put it over</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/628-3
02:20:50.692 --> 02:20:55.088
<v Josh Sparkes>here in a centralised depository.
So we we we know that it is a part of the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/628-4
02:20:55.088 --> 02:20:56.939
<v Josh Sparkes>contract as well. But how do we.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/629-0
02:20:57.179 --> 02:21:01.529
<v Josh Sparkes>Do the end to end communication and and
review. We don't know that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/629-1
02:21:01.529 --> 02:21:06.071
<v Josh Sparkes>Then like the other projects,
we have another one for the rates end to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/629-2
02:21:06.071 --> 02:21:09.461
<v Josh Sparkes>end review to be kicked off early next
year as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/629-3
02:21:09.461 --> 02:21:14.579
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think that project will be taken
care of entire gap analysis you know, OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/631-0
02:21:14.699 --> 02:21:17.013
<v Mark Sedge>OK.
So in that in that instance that what</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/630-0
02:21:15.179 --> 02:21:15.339
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/631-1
02:21:17.013 --> 02:21:21.477
<v Mark Sedge>whatever we put in place there is a risk
that we might need to rework it as long</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/631-2
02:21:21.477 --> 02:21:25.059
<v Mark Sedge>as we go in with our eyes open that that
that could be the case.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/632-0
02:21:25.899 --> 02:21:30.378
<v Josh Sparkes>I I I think mark it will be not not redo
everything but it will be rewiring of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/632-1
02:21:30.378 --> 02:21:34.631
<v Josh Sparkes>where the channels and communication and
people are involved I think yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/632-2
02:21:34.631 --> 02:21:39.223
<v Josh Sparkes>And the process if if if service now has
a functionality which will smoothen and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/632-3
02:21:39.223 --> 02:21:42.739
<v Josh Sparkes>and and in the time being then yes I mean
we will use it and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/635-0
02:21:43.219 --> 02:21:47.061
<v Josh Sparkes>I think there will be tweets made. Yeah.
Essentially, probably. What?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/633-0
02:21:43.459 --> 02:21:43.899
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/634-0
02:21:45.699 --> 02:21:46.339
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. All right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/635-1
02:21:47.061 --> 02:21:51.232
<v Josh Sparkes>What we've learned that there's a
placeholder that multiple teams can raise</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/635-2
02:21:51.232 --> 02:21:55.184
<v Josh Sparkes>because at the end of the day,
probably what you have learned that your</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/635-3
02:21:55.184 --> 02:21:57.764
<v Josh Sparkes>team.
Am I correct going to be doing the work.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/635-4
02:21:57.764 --> 02:22:02.209
<v Josh Sparkes>So for for example what I would expect
and correct me if I'm wrong in that three</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/635-5
02:22:02.209 --> 02:22:02.539
<v Josh Sparkes>teams.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/636-0
02:22:02.699 --> 02:22:07.816
<v Josh Sparkes>Owning the process right now,
how do they communicate on a new new</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/636-1
02:22:07.816 --> 02:22:12.246
<v Josh Sparkes>volume discount?
Because at the minute we're just putting</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/636-2
02:22:12.246 --> 02:22:15.607
<v Josh Sparkes>it on the share upon on on the share
drive,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/636-3
02:22:15.607 --> 02:22:18.739
<v Josh Sparkes>but each other so bad something comes in.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/637-0
02:22:19.099 --> 02:22:24.190
<v Josh Sparkes>Or a similar team and I will show to yes
and we show some importancy I use aware</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/637-1
02:22:24.190 --> 02:22:28.464
<v Josh Sparkes>of that so we are we are communicating on
each other until we hear.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/637-2
02:22:28.464 --> 02:22:32.676
<v Josh Sparkes>So you do know says I'm not.
I'm not going to see you but it's not</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/637-3
02:22:32.676 --> 02:22:37.767
<v Josh Sparkes>good with you as they reporting all the
others don't know at this point but they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/637-4
02:22:37.767 --> 02:22:38.899
<v Josh Sparkes>are still can you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/638-0
02:22:39.459 --> 02:22:42.098
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be that Mark,
probably to your point,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/638-1
02:22:42.098 --> 02:22:46.310
<v Josh Sparkes>is that things you can have assignment
groups that we know about reporting</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/638-2
02:22:46.310 --> 02:22:49.848
<v Josh Sparkes>clients that are built into.
So when you close complete volume</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/638-3
02:22:49.848 --> 02:22:52.656
<v Josh Sparkes>discount,
the notification is such that all three</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/638-4
02:22:52.656 --> 02:22:56.419
<v Josh Sparkes>gets to be informed at the same time.
There was a volume discount.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/639-0
02:22:56.699 --> 02:23:00.002
<v Josh Sparkes>Made on so.
It's an FYI and it could be that sort of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/639-1
02:23:00.002 --> 02:23:04.179
<v Josh Sparkes>fault in that episode that into
institution. Yeah. So for example,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/639-2
02:23:04.179 --> 02:23:09.477
<v Josh Sparkes>business manager sends us a request that,
oh, this is a volume discount arrangement.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/639-3
02:23:09.477 --> 02:23:13.903
<v Josh Sparkes>Now from a ServiceNow perspective,
how does that ticket get triggered?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/639-4
02:23:13.903 --> 02:23:16.459
<v Josh Sparkes>How does it get tracked in terms of what?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/640-0
02:23:16.579 --> 02:23:19.572
<v Josh Sparkes>Other tasks are, you know, impacted.
What we have to do,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/640-1
02:23:19.572 --> 02:23:23.773
<v Josh Sparkes>what US reporting have to do and how does
it close like in terms of the changes</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/640-2
02:23:23.773 --> 02:23:26.819
<v Josh Sparkes>made. I think that's where we would be,
yeah looking for.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/641-0
02:23:34.379 --> 02:23:38.423
<v Josh Sparkes>They're gonna call him that case. It.
Yeah. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/641-1
02:23:38.423 --> 02:23:45.055
<v Josh Sparkes>And so we'll get going discount queries.
So we're basically just looking at it to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/641-2
02:23:45.055 --> 02:23:49.099
<v Josh Sparkes>see you could get anything.
So so that's one the.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/642-0
02:23:49.459 --> 02:23:54.152
<v Josh Sparkes>We would need to keep on there,
so a query about from an existing volume</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/642-1
02:23:54.152 --> 02:23:57.944
<v Josh Sparkes>discount and it should be a new state up
as well. So yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/642-2
02:23:57.944 --> 02:24:01.094
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it comes on the volumes discount
a year,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/642-3
02:24:01.094 --> 02:24:05.659
<v Josh Sparkes>new new state up really all existed.
That's fine. I think as you said.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/643-0
02:24:06.779 --> 02:24:10.720
<v Josh Sparkes>You have to apply it. You know? Yeah.
At that level, I think,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/643-1
02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:15.106
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that that's clear in in that
sense. Yeah, because like, yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/643-2
02:24:15.106 --> 02:24:18.602
<v Josh Sparkes>you know from you guys,
I guess it's just as you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/643-3
02:24:18.602 --> 02:24:22.416
<v Josh Sparkes>clearly a set up. Yeah.
And where there's approval, I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/643-4
02:24:22.416 --> 02:24:23.179
<v Josh Sparkes>do you have?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/644-0
02:24:23.659 --> 02:24:28.529
<v Josh Sparkes>So as it comes in by this group,
multiple groups that can trigger it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/644-1
02:24:28.529 --> 02:24:33.539
<v Josh Sparkes>so they need to get pre approval.
Is there an assumed approval? No, no.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/644-2
02:24:33.539 --> 02:24:36.739
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like making requests if if the
requests,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/644-3
02:24:36.739 --> 02:24:42.097
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah they will just make make the request
basically OK or or is the thing we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/644-4
02:24:42.097 --> 02:24:43.419
<v Josh Sparkes>discovered through.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/645-0
02:24:43.579 --> 02:24:48.272
<v Josh Sparkes>Do an engagement letter and then we
actually go back to them and say,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/645-1
02:24:48.272 --> 02:24:51.625
<v Josh Sparkes>how do you want the self?
Is it a VP or you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/645-2
02:24:51.625 --> 02:24:56.787
<v Josh Sparkes>whatever example that if we are doing
something and we pick up an engagement</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/645-3
02:24:56.787 --> 02:24:59.939
<v Josh Sparkes>letter,
we identify there's a volume discount.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/646-0
02:25:00.339 --> 02:25:00.739
<v Josh Sparkes>But.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/647-0
02:25:02.059 --> 02:25:05.339
<v Josh Sparkes>Might not be aware of it,
but the partners might not be aware of it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/649-0
02:25:07.019 --> 02:25:11.716
<v Josh Sparkes>I also run a monthly report and the ones
that read the Rama team are tracking.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/649-1
02:25:11.716 --> 02:25:14.450
<v Josh Sparkes>So as I said,
no different areas of tracking.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/649-2
02:25:14.450 --> 02:25:19.385
<v Josh Sparkes>So the ones we are tracking through three,
we pull the report once they through 3D</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/649-3
02:25:19.385 --> 02:25:24.320
<v Josh Sparkes>and which helps us to identify which ones
and thresholds and for all the ones that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/649-4
02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:26.579
<v Josh Sparkes>set the threshold really against each.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/650-0
02:25:26.739 --> 02:25:29.641
<v Josh Sparkes>Find in three and we update it's just a
fit box.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/650-1
02:25:29.641 --> 02:25:34.202
<v Josh Sparkes>We update and then we apply the new.
You know the new percentage discount on</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/650-2
02:25:34.202 --> 02:25:38.763
<v Josh Sparkes>the new leads or and whatever it is.
And then we we then go to the quite big</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/650-3
02:25:38.763 --> 02:25:43.383
<v Josh Sparkes>task and once a month we then go to the
partner and we're making aware of the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/650-4
02:25:43.383 --> 02:25:45.219
<v Josh Sparkes>definition which has been kept.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/651-0
02:25:46.379 --> 02:25:49.533
<v Josh Sparkes>Just OK. Yeah.
So I think that that's just apparently,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/651-1
02:25:49.533 --> 02:25:52.113
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah,
first thing piece and that's something</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/651-2
02:25:52.113 --> 02:25:55.210
<v Josh Sparkes>service now can help of capturing the
threshold into,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/651-3
02:25:55.210 --> 02:25:59.740
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean triggering the notification.
I think that's something you can leverage,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/651-4
02:25:59.740 --> 02:26:03.410
<v Josh Sparkes>you should raise something internally
that's now. Yeah, I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/651-5
02:26:03.410 --> 02:26:05.819
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean how often you've that you've found?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/652-0
02:26:05.899 --> 02:26:11.042
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's so it's very proactive and then
you can update that the threshold and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/652-1
02:26:11.042 --> 02:26:14.623
<v Josh Sparkes>then inform the partner, yeah,
this is the case. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/652-2
02:26:14.623 --> 02:26:18.073
<v Josh Sparkes>So it is suppose off managed volume
discount raised.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/652-3
02:26:18.073 --> 02:26:22.175
<v Josh Sparkes>You're applying the change and then you
can open and complete.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/652-4
02:26:22.175 --> 02:26:24.779
<v Josh Sparkes>And again if you need to inform those 3.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/653-0
02:26:25.579 --> 02:26:29.699
<v Josh Sparkes>You know very three partners if you think
that should all the three groups that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/653-1
02:26:29.699 --> 02:26:33.716
<v Josh Sparkes>should they could be built into that
notification and it would also go to the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/653-2
02:26:33.716 --> 02:26:37.269
<v Josh Sparkes>requester. But interestingly,
you're raising it proactively that you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/653-3
02:26:37.269 --> 02:26:40.153
<v Josh Sparkes>want to inform.
It could be that you raise a new volume</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/653-4
02:26:40.153 --> 02:26:42.059
<v Josh Sparkes>discount exists, you're not applying.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/654-0
02:26:42.339 --> 02:26:46.743
<v Josh Sparkes>If you want to do the FYI so you're
tracking them so now maybe that's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/654-1
02:26:46.743 --> 02:26:51.146
<v Josh Sparkes>interesting that you've informed the
partner and then tasks that were</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/654-2
02:26:51.146 --> 02:26:54.292
<v Josh Sparkes>associated with that,
maybe they say keep remove.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/654-3
02:26:54.292 --> 02:26:58.129
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean what happened then that sort of
storytelling on that?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/654-4
02:26:58.129 --> 02:27:02.219
<v Josh Sparkes>So generally if we pick it up and I will
then request a meeting.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/655-0
02:27:02.819 --> 02:27:07.687
<v Josh Sparkes>And with myself and reporting to and the
partner of the licence charge so that we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/655-1
02:27:07.687 --> 02:27:11.367
<v Josh Sparkes>cover all the bases, so we know, right,
this is what we need.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/655-2
02:27:11.367 --> 02:27:15.641
<v Josh Sparkes>This is going to step with reporting.
Who will manage it or accepts us.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/655-3
02:27:15.641 --> 02:27:19.619
<v Josh Sparkes>So we need to work out who should be
managing it on that could be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/656-0
02:27:19.859 --> 02:27:23.773
<v Josh Sparkes>Assigned to because we've got some
reporting assignment groups that can</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/656-1
02:27:23.773 --> 02:27:27.742
<v Josh Sparkes>reassigned or it remains again.
Is that Rama global? Does it tend to be?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/656-2
02:27:27.742 --> 02:27:30.895
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, OK.
There's only some people in the team that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/656-3
02:27:30.895 --> 02:27:34.537
<v Josh Sparkes>actually do with volume.
There's cancer at the moment because it's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/656-4
02:27:34.537 --> 02:27:38.234
<v Josh Sparkes>quite complex at the moment.
So that could be a field matrix that's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/656-5
02:27:38.234 --> 02:27:39.539
<v Josh Sparkes>also assigned, you know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/657-0
02:27:39.859 --> 02:27:43.513
<v Josh Sparkes>And the whole group,
it could be that there was a particular,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/657-1
02:27:43.513 --> 02:27:46.460
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
just before review or five of you or if</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/657-2
02:27:46.460 --> 02:27:51.293
<v Josh Sparkes>you however many but so as part of that
action you know that work for the service</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/657-3
02:27:51.293 --> 02:27:55.419
<v Josh Sparkes>now is that request the meeting or it's
in with and then it's either.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/658-0
02:27:56.539 --> 02:27:59.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Aside,
you're tracking on your dashboards where</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/658-1
02:27:59.497 --> 02:28:04.242
<v Josh Sparkes>the and the life of them or the metrics
of it, and it could be, as you said,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/658-2
02:28:04.242 --> 02:28:09.049
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe real financial reporting or then
you pick it up and then what tasks and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/658-3
02:28:09.049 --> 02:28:13.609
<v Josh Sparkes>then obviously it's off your queues
because it's being reassigned and you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/658-4
02:28:13.609 --> 02:28:13.979
<v Josh Sparkes>could.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/660-0
02:28:14.579 --> 02:28:18.629
<v Josh Sparkes>If you needed to see to still see the
life cycle of it, you still go in.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/660-1
02:28:18.629 --> 02:28:22.291
<v Josh Sparkes>You don't lose visibility,
it's just to actually it's not on your</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/660-2
02:28:22.291 --> 02:28:26.397
<v Josh Sparkes>queue of work. Yeah, it's it for yourself.
What tasks are you then doing?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/660-3
02:28:26.397 --> 02:28:29.615
<v Josh Sparkes>Are you then applying discounts or
adjusting the account?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/660-4
02:28:29.615 --> 02:28:33.499
<v Josh Sparkes>So if we're if it's a brand new one,
we're going to set it up in 3 E.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/661-0
02:28:34.179 --> 02:28:37.481
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, to do that,
so we set it up and we make sure all the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/661-1
02:28:37.481 --> 02:28:42.058
<v Josh Sparkes>notes that are on there and still to
ensure that that will pull through in the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/661-2
02:28:42.058 --> 02:28:44.608
<v Josh Sparkes>monthly report and treaty for us to do,
OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/661-3
02:28:44.608 --> 02:28:49.417
<v Josh Sparkes>the work back to do the new and then if
it's adjustments you make the adjustments,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/661-4
02:28:49.417 --> 02:28:52.140
<v Josh Sparkes>yes.
So either at the monthly report time when</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/661-5
02:28:52.140 --> 02:28:53.299
<v Josh Sparkes>we realise official.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/663-0
02:28:53.379 --> 02:28:58.519
<v Josh Sparkes>It's been hit and do the adjustments or
we make it request you for adjustments</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/663-1
02:28:58.519 --> 02:29:03.659
<v Josh Sparkes>and that that's generally because you're
proactive and then you could have the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/663-2
02:29:03.659 --> 02:29:08.800
<v Josh Sparkes>root cause on this and then close and
you're notifying yourself because you're</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/663-3
02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:12.899
<v Josh Sparkes>the ones that, I mean,
you're notifying yourself, just remain.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/664-0
02:29:13.019 --> 02:29:16.059
<v Josh Sparkes>Or internal. Yes, tracker, I think 1.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/665-0
02:29:18.899 --> 02:29:25.912
<v Josh Sparkes>I just have a manage on the discount.
Next one in Dan. The living room always.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/665-1
02:29:25.912 --> 02:29:33.015
<v Josh Sparkes>We're currently processing removing that
and by the time these guys come over a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/665-2
02:29:33.015 --> 02:29:33.459
<v Josh Sparkes>week.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/666-0
02:29:35.579 --> 02:29:35.779
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/667-0
02:29:39.979 --> 02:29:43.819
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good. Great matter, man.
You've got a few there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/668-0
02:29:47.579 --> 02:29:49.979
<v Josh Sparkes>Take lots of things update yourself.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/669-0
02:29:51.739 --> 02:29:55.704
<v Josh Sparkes>It's going on just about. Oh, yeah.
So we're yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/669-1
02:29:55.704 --> 02:29:59.437
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've got this create Martin manually.
Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/669-2
02:29:59.437 --> 02:30:05.891
<v Josh Sparkes>So create Martin manually is obviously if
it's a normal client or whatever it goes</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/669-3
02:30:05.891 --> 02:30:11.179
<v Josh Sparkes>through PS through it on MPI and sat know
that we do all the stuff.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/670-0
02:30:12.019 --> 02:30:17.027
<v Josh Sparkes>The type of matter that weekly tends to
maybe could be billable,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/670-1
02:30:17.027 --> 02:30:23.268
<v Josh Sparkes>but then what we call internal matters
and there's lots of different categories.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/670-2
02:30:23.268 --> 02:30:26.659
<v Josh Sparkes>And to be a knowledge and expertise
matter.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/671-0
02:30:29.099 --> 02:30:34.369
<v Josh Sparkes>Actually just an internal matter for
projects and and we can they're all</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/671-1
02:30:34.369 --> 02:30:40.145
<v Josh Sparkes>different ones and all the expertise OGC.
But there's a category of them, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/671-2
02:30:40.145 --> 02:30:44.983
<v Josh Sparkes>So so there's categories and then when
these matters were created,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/671-3
02:30:44.983 --> 02:30:46.499
<v Josh Sparkes>I would probably see.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/672-0
02:30:46.579 --> 02:30:50.863
<v Josh Sparkes>20% of the time in what we called
chargeable, we're not available,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/672-1
02:30:50.863 --> 02:30:55.723
<v Josh Sparkes>so it means that the fear now who's
working on that will receive the credit</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/672-2
02:30:55.723 --> 02:30:59.240
<v Josh Sparkes>from the nervous that we're not charged
on the client.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/672-3
02:30:59.240 --> 02:31:02.374
<v Josh Sparkes>There is occasions that we need this cash
value,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/672-4
02:31:02.374 --> 02:31:06.019
<v Josh Sparkes>accounts and stuff like that that we may
charge account.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/673-0
02:31:06.259 --> 02:31:09.233
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't think probably doesn't matter to
to yourselves,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/673-1
02:31:09.233 --> 02:31:13.536
<v Josh Sparkes>but so basically we're we're creating the
matters because they're different from</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/673-2
02:31:13.536 --> 02:31:17.307
<v Josh Sparkes>the normal stream of matters,
but they're still going to report saying</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/673-3
02:31:17.307 --> 02:31:21.822
<v Josh Sparkes>that the fact that it's charge or are you
looking at chargeable time on. Yeah, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/673-4
02:31:21.822 --> 02:31:25.859
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll ask irrelevant questions and and
that could be quite good as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/674-0
02:31:25.979 --> 02:31:30.750
<v Josh Sparkes>Because it wouldn't matter what
information and how do they come into you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/674-1
02:31:30.750 --> 02:31:34.377
<v Josh Sparkes>Just a request.
Can you create a matter and then? Hello.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/674-2
02:31:34.377 --> 02:31:37.749
<v Josh Sparkes>Anybody. It's usually P ES.
Again it could be, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/674-3
02:31:37.749 --> 02:31:40.739
<v Josh Sparkes>Knowledge and expertise will send through
and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/675-0
02:31:41.259 --> 02:31:45.974
<v Josh Sparkes>And there might be other departments for
all the the make sense and through as</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/675-1
02:31:45.974 --> 02:31:48.600
<v Josh Sparkes>well.
So if we're talking about the system,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/675-2
02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:51.465
<v Josh Sparkes>we get to have a template of upfront
questions.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/675-3
02:31:51.465 --> 02:31:56.419
<v Josh Sparkes>And so we've got that information. Yeah,
absolutely. I can just check. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/676-0
02:31:56.859 --> 02:32:00.068
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
And then literally we go in and on three</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/676-1
02:32:00.068 --> 02:32:03.073
<v Josh Sparkes>E,
we treat this matter obviously depending</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/676-2
02:32:03.073 --> 02:32:06.556
<v Josh Sparkes>what type of matter it is,
those different fields,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/676-3
02:32:06.556 --> 02:32:10.654
<v Josh Sparkes>links or clients and no, no, no.
It's normally general, no,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/676-4
02:32:10.654 --> 02:32:15.571
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just a straightforward matter
numbers, OK, yeah. Sorry. Apologies,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/676-5
02:32:15.571 --> 02:32:16.459
<v Josh Sparkes>some of them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/677-0
02:32:16.579 --> 02:32:21.554
<v Josh Sparkes>And I can be linked to a client number.
They can be a lot that could be part of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/677-1
02:32:21.554 --> 02:32:26.157
<v Josh Sparkes>the checklist if you want it. No,
I don't think. I think. No, that. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/677-2
02:32:26.157 --> 02:32:29.142
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be part of the information we
require.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/677-3
02:32:29.142 --> 02:32:34.242
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll have a list of questions of the
type of matter we want an independent on</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/677-4
02:32:34.242 --> 02:32:35.859
<v Josh Sparkes>that type. We'll ask them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/678-0
02:32:36.419 --> 02:32:40.709
<v Josh Sparkes>If we can get the copy of that,
we can go to announce that would be very</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/678-1
02:32:40.709 --> 02:32:44.118
<v Josh Sparkes>helpful. So sorry,
we keep going just I was just going to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/678-2
02:32:44.118 --> 02:32:48.937
<v Josh Sparkes>ask quickly see when asked people send in
a request to someone's going on clients</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/678-3
02:32:48.937 --> 02:32:53.638
<v Josh Sparkes>to comment yet to create a matter number
is this what it would come under? Yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/678-4
02:32:53.638 --> 02:32:54.579
<v Josh Sparkes>this is so this.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/679-0
02:32:54.939 --> 02:32:59.185
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the coordinate matter.
So that's one of them as well. Cool.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/679-1
02:32:59.185 --> 02:33:03.758
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you. That both under that, that,
that checklist subtypes. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/679-2
02:33:03.758 --> 02:33:08.331
<v Josh Sparkes>And that what's. Yeah. Quite good.
As people actually send a template</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/679-3
02:33:08.331 --> 02:33:09.899
<v Josh Sparkes>through but don't so so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/680-0
02:33:10.739 --> 02:33:15.035
<v Josh Sparkes>No, no. I was just going to say so.
We'll create the matter and it'll create</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/680-1
02:33:15.035 --> 02:33:19.442
<v Josh Sparkes>a matter number and then we'll respond
back and we'll say your matter has been</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/680-2
02:33:19.442 --> 02:33:22.176
<v Josh Sparkes>created.
Your matter number is OK and that could</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/680-3
02:33:22.176 --> 02:33:25.859
<v Josh Sparkes>be part of the notification that you call
in. So get the request.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/681-0
02:33:26.459 --> 02:33:29.738
<v Josh Sparkes>Don't need pre approval. No,
it's not OK on the request.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/681-1
02:33:29.738 --> 02:33:33.939
<v Josh Sparkes>Sir is always on behalf and it might be
on behalf. It is just the. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/681-2
02:33:33.939 --> 02:33:38.657
<v Josh Sparkes>the information that we do need. Yeah.
And you know there's relevant information,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/681-3
02:33:38.657 --> 02:33:41.304
<v Josh Sparkes>but it has to be a partner who's
responsible.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/681-4
02:33:41.304 --> 02:33:44.699
<v Josh Sparkes>We have to put a responsible partner and
we can't just be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/682-0
02:33:45.099 --> 02:33:49.018
<v Josh Sparkes>Treated by anybody so that the same
information, OK? Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/682-1
02:33:49.018 --> 02:33:54.333
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's actually a point if we can talk
about you and start to think about the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/682-2
02:33:54.333 --> 02:33:57.721
<v Josh Sparkes>notification banks of the person that
needs to be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/682-3
02:33:57.721 --> 02:34:00.179
<v Josh Sparkes>But it could be on behalf of or four.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/683-0
02:34:00.699 --> 02:34:05.513
<v Josh Sparkes>That's all. All the.
All they needed is being created and your</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/683-1
02:34:05.513 --> 02:34:09.486
<v Josh Sparkes>matter number,
that's that's all they needed. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/683-2
02:34:09.486 --> 02:34:13.689
<v Josh Sparkes>So can we mark this one as as a as an
item as an item,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/683-3
02:34:13.689 --> 02:34:16.899
<v Josh Sparkes>as a process to review the second process.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/684-0
02:34:17.979 --> 02:34:22.432
<v Josh Sparkes>Because it's for my involvement.
Billing involvement.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/684-1
02:34:22.432 --> 02:34:28.205
<v Josh Sparkes>Ask people and also the fees the bees do
manage this economy as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/684-2
02:34:28.205 --> 02:34:32.658
<v Josh Sparkes>Just this morning,
I've kind of like went through the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/684-3
02:34:32.658 --> 02:34:36.699
<v Josh Sparkes>process review and we want.
We don't want to be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/685-0
02:34:36.779 --> 02:34:39.182
<v Josh Sparkes>Ease to do the secondment process any
longer,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/685-1
02:34:39.182 --> 02:34:42.579
<v Josh Sparkes>so I'm gonna be speaking to the OPS
managers etcetera this week,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/685-2
02:34:42.579 --> 02:34:46.237
<v Josh Sparkes>but I'll just bring that process the
entire 100% process with an ask.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/685-3
02:34:46.237 --> 02:34:49.999
<v Josh Sparkes>So I don't know where we want to track
this like as a change control or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/685-4
02:34:49.999 --> 02:34:51.619
<v Josh Sparkes>something or I'll be good, but.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/686-0
02:34:52.259 --> 02:34:56.350
<v Josh Sparkes>There's something for me to pick it up so
I don't forget as well. So ask.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/686-1
02:34:56.350 --> 02:35:00.441
<v Josh Sparkes>People should be involved as usual,
but then billing would be responsible</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/686-2
02:35:00.441 --> 02:35:03.813
<v Josh Sparkes>going forward for all the 2nd invoices.
OK, once I give you,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/686-3
02:35:03.813 --> 02:35:07.572
<v Josh Sparkes>that's the one that one.
Once I give a green light. Yeah. Yes, yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/686-4
02:35:07.572 --> 02:35:10.779
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. These ones here.
These matters are old and old areas.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/687-0
02:35:11.899 --> 02:35:14.866
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. OK. Yeah. OK.
And then they get notified of their</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/687-1
02:35:14.866 --> 02:35:18.205
<v Josh Sparkes>master number and then it's closed. Yeah,
that's it. OK. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/687-2
02:35:18.205 --> 02:35:22.604
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you know the template that asking for
send over? I need to change that as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/687-3
02:35:22.604 --> 02:35:27.002
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's what I need to change to that as
well. OK, because I'm just going to say,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/687-4
02:35:27.002 --> 02:35:30.659
<v Josh Sparkes>could we potentially use that as maybe
like the fields for the form?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/688-0
02:35:31.059 --> 02:35:34.479
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
There is some difference. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/688-1
02:35:34.479 --> 02:35:38.144
<v Josh Sparkes>but at least if it gets as a bit of a
starter for the horn,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/688-2
02:35:38.144 --> 02:35:42.542
<v Josh Sparkes>then we can tweak it. Yeah. Yeah,
there is differences. Yeah. You know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/688-3
02:35:42.542 --> 02:35:46.512
<v Josh Sparkes>I sometimes look the information that you
need and all together.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/688-4
02:35:46.512 --> 02:35:50.299
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the leaving questions.
And so that and just on that one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/689-0
02:35:50.739 --> 02:35:56.293
<v Josh Sparkes>And the Australian guys do their own
because they do other stuff that we just</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/689-1
02:35:56.293 --> 02:35:59.640
<v Josh Sparkes>don't do,
they do the theses and tasks and all</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/689-2
02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:02.915
<v Josh Sparkes>sorts.
But the Glasgow team doesn't do so all</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/689-3
02:36:02.915 --> 02:36:07.259
<v Josh Sparkes>that matter. Yeah.
So for an Australian matter that is more.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/690-0
02:36:08.059 --> 02:36:13.179
<v Josh Sparkes>Information that needs to be added,
and so the Australian team know how to do</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/690-1
02:36:13.179 --> 02:36:16.133
<v Josh Sparkes>that.
So they tend to do their own and we do</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/690-2
02:36:16.133 --> 02:36:19.086
<v Josh Sparkes>request the level,
could that be globalised?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/690-3
02:36:19.086 --> 02:36:22.303
<v Josh Sparkes>You're asking with similar questions,
yeah. Yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/690-4
02:36:22.303 --> 02:36:25.979
<v Josh Sparkes>Then potentially based on the location of
that leading.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/691-0
02:36:26.139 --> 02:36:30.943
<v Josh Sparkes>Requester or it can be chosen and it's
assigned to Australia or the UK and based</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/691-1
02:36:30.943 --> 02:36:35.450
<v Josh Sparkes>on that any subsequent localised health,
a need to complete could be shown.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/691-2
02:36:35.450 --> 02:36:39.543
<v Josh Sparkes>Other than having two different ones,
I'm just saying that you yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/691-3
02:36:39.543 --> 02:36:44.228
<v Josh Sparkes>the template could be the same. Yeah.
Missing questions overall just currently</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/691-4
02:36:44.228 --> 02:36:45.059
<v Josh Sparkes>at the moment.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/692-0
02:36:46.059 --> 02:36:50.930
<v Josh Sparkes>The Rama team in Australia who stuff that
we don't do that we will then pass that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/692-1
02:36:50.930 --> 02:36:54.851
<v Josh Sparkes>task on to Fensus team at the moment.
It's something that we are.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/692-2
02:36:54.851 --> 02:36:58.831
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's just obviously OK,
I would not do that team and that's how</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/692-3
02:36:58.831 --> 02:37:02.099
<v Josh Sparkes>it is at the moment.
But so that's something that the.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/693-0
02:37:03.339 --> 02:37:08.932
<v Josh Sparkes>Llama UK or don't do. Can't stop it. Yeah,
but you passed it on because this just.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/693-1
02:37:08.932 --> 02:37:12.233
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah.
There's only when that part of that,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/693-2
02:37:12.233 --> 02:37:16.681
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not always asked for,
but sometimes they ask for it's called</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/693-3
02:37:16.681 --> 02:37:22.139
<v Josh Sparkes>theses and tasks and only Australia do
that. So what still you do that? They've.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/694-0
02:37:22.339 --> 02:37:25.957
<v Josh Sparkes>They've always done that,
but they've never done it here in Glasgow</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/694-1
02:37:25.957 --> 02:37:29.043
<v Josh Sparkes>it's it's something this task,
that part of it in the UK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/694-2
02:37:29.043 --> 02:37:32.875
<v Josh Sparkes>in the UK I'm thinking for work.
So you still it still have to be done,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/694-3
02:37:32.875 --> 02:37:36.706
<v Josh Sparkes>but rather just don't do it before the
request that it doesn't make any</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/694-4
02:37:36.706 --> 02:37:39.899
<v Josh Sparkes>difference. Yeah, exactly.
So I'm just thinking it's still.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/695-0
02:37:40.339 --> 02:37:45.783
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, the whole entire is a take.
The people amount to it that need to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/695-1
02:37:45.783 --> 02:37:50.767
<v Josh Sparkes>complete. It's all the time. Yeah.
But in Rama, Australia do it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/695-2
02:37:50.767 --> 02:37:57.055
<v Josh Sparkes>And is that a challenge that in Rama UK
could do it or is it it's something we we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/695-3
02:37:57.055 --> 02:37:58.819
<v Josh Sparkes>possibly could look at.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/696-0
02:37:59.939 --> 02:38:04.729
<v Josh Sparkes>At the moment when we were talking about
the the closing times and stuff,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/696-1
02:38:04.729 --> 02:38:09.519
<v Josh Sparkes>so sometimes it's still you send
something through and it's for to create</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/696-2
02:38:09.519 --> 02:38:14.179
<v Josh Sparkes>a new matter and there's tasks and phases
on there. Generally speaking,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/696-3
02:38:14.179 --> 02:38:15.539
<v Josh Sparkes>Princess won't do it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/697-0
02:38:15.859 --> 02:38:19.889
<v Josh Sparkes>So it has to wait until the story guys
open up again and they will open.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/697-1
02:38:19.889 --> 02:38:24.085
<v Josh Sparkes>But that's that's something discussing
you don't know, Debra, just on that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/697-2
02:38:24.085 --> 02:38:26.680
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry,
I think came the phases and tasks alarm</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/697-3
02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:31.263
<v Josh Sparkes>bells on our friends here around I think
we spoke about that and the E belling one</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/697-4
02:38:31.263 --> 02:38:34.189
<v Josh Sparkes>with Anna.
You know how she mentioned that it's only</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/697-5
02:38:34.189 --> 02:38:35.459
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia that do that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/699-0
02:38:35.819 --> 02:38:39.799
<v Josh Sparkes>And she mentioned fences as well,
which are obviously IT is that a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/699-1
02:38:39.799 --> 02:38:44.493
<v Josh Sparkes>discussion that we had that and I would
be happy for fences just to take it or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/699-2
02:38:44.493 --> 02:38:48.949
<v Josh Sparkes>some there was some chat and the E
billing one around it's just that drama</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/700-0
02:38:46.979 --> 02:38:52.241
<v Mark Sedge>If if it's a straight if,
it's a straight task that the I did,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/699-3
02:38:48.949 --> 02:38:50.019
<v Josh Sparkes>is supposed to be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/700-1
02:38:52.241 --> 02:38:58.339
<v Mark Sedge>did I hear that right that it's an IT
team that needs to take an action?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/701-0
02:38:59.659 --> 02:39:03.139
<v Josh Sparkes>It's been says you who sit with an IT
year financial assistance.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/704-0
02:39:02.139 --> 02:39:05.037
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
so So what we'd expect is if they need to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/704-1
02:39:05.037 --> 02:39:08.781
<v Mark Sedge>just take that action,
then they would get a downstream task,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/704-2
02:39:08.781 --> 02:39:11.679
<v Mark Sedge>fulfil it,
and then you'd get notification that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/703-0
02:39:10.579 --> 02:39:10.819
<v Josh Sparkes>Umm.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/704-3
02:39:11.679 --> 02:39:14.819
<v Mark Sedge>they've done it all.
All part of the same workflow.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/705-0
02:39:16.259 --> 02:39:20.974
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, but for the moment in Australia,
the team gravity will do the pass,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/705-1
02:39:20.974 --> 02:39:24.097
<v Josh Sparkes>but gravity in Glasgow will send it to
Princess.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/705-2
02:39:24.097 --> 02:39:28.876
<v Josh Sparkes>That's the most part of the work. Yes.
Yeah. Yeah. OK. And what are those?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/705-3
02:39:28.876 --> 02:39:34.229
<v Josh Sparkes>Just to take that was about entering work.
And what parts are they or what needs to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/705-4
02:39:34.229 --> 02:39:34.739
<v Josh Sparkes>be done?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/707-0
02:39:35.419 --> 02:39:37.858
<v Josh Sparkes>What? Yeah,
it might be just the need stuff</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/707-1
02:39:37.858 --> 02:39:40.851
<v Josh Sparkes>categorised.
I don't know much because I've not done.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/707-2
02:39:40.851 --> 02:39:44.676
<v Josh Sparkes>Obviously you know, but they need,
you know they will need different</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/707-3
02:39:44.676 --> 02:39:48.334
<v Josh Sparkes>categories or different work.
I'm assuming that's something else.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/707-4
02:39:48.334 --> 02:39:52.547
<v Josh Sparkes>It's done in the background that I'm not,
you know, because we don't do it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/706-0
02:39:52.499 --> 02:39:52.779
<v Mark Sedge>Sir.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/707-5
02:39:52.547 --> 02:39:54.099
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not like fully aware of.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/708-0
02:39:54.659 --> 02:39:58.059
<v Josh Sparkes>Isolation with categories or something
that needs to happen.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/711-0
02:39:57.219 --> 02:40:00.523
<v Mark Sedge>The key I think,
I think there were the key thing we need</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/711-1
02:40:00.523 --> 02:40:04.910
<v Mark Sedge>to do is the receiving team of that task.
We just need to validate what what</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/709-0
02:40:04.499 --> 02:40:04.659
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/711-2
02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:09.468
<v Mark Sedge>minimum information they need to be able
to action it and make sure that that's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/710-0
02:40:08.379 --> 02:40:08.619
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/711-3
02:40:09.468 --> 02:40:10.779
<v Mark Sedge>available in that task.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/712-0
02:40:12.499 --> 02:40:15.601
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So it might be the fact that you've got</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/712-1
02:40:15.601 --> 02:40:20.188
<v Josh Sparkes>the category of the pipe. Yeah,
that's coming in. Yes, that update,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/712-2
02:40:20.188 --> 02:40:25.112
<v Josh Sparkes>just check that the categories or
whatever it is in system exists or any</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/712-3
02:40:25.112 --> 02:40:30.238
<v Josh Sparkes>changes or new alignment of that.
It's probably a kind of it's a validation</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/712-4
02:40:30.238 --> 02:40:32.059
<v Josh Sparkes>cheques and balances of it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/713-0
02:40:32.219 --> 02:40:32.539
<v Josh Sparkes>And then.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/714-0
02:40:33.579 --> 02:40:37.149
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, to be fair,
I would probably see 90% of internal</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/714-1
02:40:37.149 --> 02:40:41.973
<v Josh Sparkes>matter requests that the Glasgow team
perceive they don't ask for phases and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/714-2
02:40:41.973 --> 02:40:45.418
<v Josh Sparkes>tasks anyway.
Generally speaking later on they may ask</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/714-3
02:40:45.418 --> 02:40:49.804
<v Josh Sparkes>and request it and then they would ask
Princess or if it comes to us,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/714-4
02:40:49.804 --> 02:40:52.059
<v Josh Sparkes>we would send it to Princess anyway.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/715-0
02:40:53.059 --> 02:40:55.999
<v Josh Sparkes>They don't.
What I'm saying is they don't all have</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/715-1
02:40:55.999 --> 02:40:58.594
<v Josh Sparkes>that.
It's not something that has to be when</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/715-2
02:40:58.594 --> 02:41:02.053
<v Josh Sparkes>every single, but that's something,
I mean, probably, mark,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/715-3
02:41:02.053 --> 02:41:06.204
<v Josh Sparkes>what you're leaving is that that's the
trigger of there's rules of yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/715-4
02:41:06.204 --> 02:41:09.779
<v Josh Sparkes>No required. Yes. No.
And then if I go allocated or it's not.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/716-0
02:41:10.099 --> 02:41:10.219
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/717-0
02:41:10.779 --> 02:41:13.123
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
and and I think the key thing is it when</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/717-1
02:41:13.123 --> 02:41:15.317
<v Mark Sedge>it when it does need to go there,
as I say,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/717-2
02:41:15.317 --> 02:41:18.459
<v Mark Sedge>it sweeps up the pertinent data that they
need to take action.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/718-0
02:41:20.299 --> 02:41:20.539
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/719-0
02:41:23.379 --> 02:41:23.579
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/720-0
02:41:25.899 --> 02:41:31.847
<v Josh Sparkes>That was helpful and then no approval,
so just go to that, mind, no approval,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/720-1
02:41:31.847 --> 02:41:37.719
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean close and then back to the
requester with that matching number, yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/720-2
02:41:37.719 --> 02:41:38.939
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's good.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/721-0
02:41:43.499 --> 02:41:46.019
<v Josh Sparkes>Update QA.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/722-0
02:41:48.219 --> 02:41:55.933
<v Josh Sparkes>Right, update matters status,
so we will get a request to to suspend</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/722-1
02:41:55.933 --> 02:42:01.859
<v Josh Sparkes>the matter or make it no matter that or
close it so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/723-0
02:42:02.979 --> 02:42:06.337
<v Josh Sparkes>There are certain ones that will need
approval from compliance,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/723-1
02:42:06.337 --> 02:42:09.905
<v Josh Sparkes>so if it's straightforward to spend,
we can do that. If it's close,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/723-2
02:42:09.905 --> 02:42:12.581
<v Josh Sparkes>we would probably go through to
compliance. Sorry,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/723-3
02:42:12.581 --> 02:42:15.782
<v Josh Sparkes>we would go through to compliance and you
know for approval.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/723-4
02:42:15.782 --> 02:42:17.619
<v Josh Sparkes>But normally we would just suspend.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/724-0
02:42:18.019 --> 02:42:23.326
<v Josh Sparkes>Or no matter that so we're just basically
changing it so that no bills can be added</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/724-1
02:42:23.326 --> 02:42:27.559
<v Josh Sparkes>on or for suspending it. OK,
we're on hold or yes. Yeah. You know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/724-2
02:42:27.559 --> 02:42:32.676
<v Josh Sparkes>advise here in the investigation or on
hold or suspend or close or cancel. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/724-3
02:42:32.676 --> 02:42:37.099
<v Josh Sparkes>Or it could be closed and then asking it
to be made current in which.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/725-0
02:42:37.619 --> 02:42:42.136
<v Josh Sparkes>We wouldn't do that either. We would ask,
we'd send that through to compliance team</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/725-1
02:42:42.136 --> 02:42:45.040
<v Josh Sparkes>to approve.
So for certain statuses compliance and to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/725-2
02:42:45.040 --> 02:42:48.428
<v Josh Sparkes>have approval. Yeah,
I suppose that's the conversation itself,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/725-3
02:42:48.428 --> 02:42:52.300
<v Josh Sparkes>but nothing really gets closed. Yes,
it's always closed councils. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/725-4
02:42:52.300 --> 02:42:53.699
<v Josh Sparkes>actually probably will it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/726-0
02:42:54.219 --> 02:42:58.412
<v Josh Sparkes>On hold, so it's not used,
but it can easily be very accurate here.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/726-1
02:42:58.412 --> 02:43:03.038
<v Josh Sparkes>That will be a compliance issue.
So they come in and then how do they come</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/726-2
02:43:03.038 --> 02:43:05.937
<v Josh Sparkes>into you?
It's it's it's simple from the mease</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/726-3
02:43:05.937 --> 02:43:08.773
<v Josh Sparkes>again. Yeah, that's a number.
Please suspend.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/726-4
02:43:08.773 --> 02:43:11.179
<v Josh Sparkes>Please make currently I'm sorry please.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/727-0
02:43:11.259 --> 02:43:15.703
<v Josh Sparkes>Reopen, please. No, whatever.
We just want to update has changed</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/727-1
02:43:15.703 --> 02:43:21.105
<v Josh Sparkes>depending on what status they want to
change to and we will then if it's we'll</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/727-2
02:43:21.105 --> 02:43:25.480
<v Josh Sparkes>complete the task. If it's,
we don't need approval and just say</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/727-3
02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:30.540
<v Josh Sparkes>that's it done or we will e-mail
compliance and CCN the requester to stay</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/727-4
02:43:30.540 --> 02:43:31.019
<v Josh Sparkes>please.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/728-0
02:43:31.179 --> 02:43:34.219
<v Josh Sparkes>Approved. So just so they know. Yeah,
we're waiting for approval.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/728-1
02:43:34.219 --> 02:43:37.719
<v Josh Sparkes>And then once compliance approves,
we will then and finish the task similar</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/728-2
02:43:37.719 --> 02:43:39.884
<v Josh Sparkes>to before,
but you're going to do that once in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/728-3
02:43:39.884 --> 02:43:40.299
<v Josh Sparkes>approval.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/729-0
02:43:43.779 --> 02:43:49.706
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's straightforward on that
one and you don't answer any other data,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/729-1
02:43:49.706 --> 02:43:53.039
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
it's that effective date from presumably</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/729-2
02:43:53.039 --> 02:43:58.522
<v Josh Sparkes>that you should not find them anymore.
Yeah, it's automatically the date.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/729-3
02:43:58.522 --> 02:44:02.819
<v Josh Sparkes>That's when you do it. Yeah,
it's complete new capturing.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/730-0
02:44:02.859 --> 02:44:03.059
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/731-0
02:44:04.539 --> 02:44:08.893
<v Josh Sparkes>You don't capture reason for change.
There's no nothing, no nothing like that,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/731-1
02:44:08.893 --> 02:44:09.059
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/732-0
02:44:12.339 --> 02:44:16.574
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a QQAQA that pops up,
I think actually probably.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/732-1
02:44:16.574 --> 02:44:21.438
<v Josh Sparkes>I think rates have a lot of that as well.
It's quite similar,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/732-2
02:44:21.438 --> 02:44:25.438
<v Josh Sparkes>but if I cover the first one,
which is a main one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/732-3
02:44:25.438 --> 02:44:28.419
<v Josh Sparkes>So the other matter or the massive UA.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/733-0
02:44:31.379 --> 02:44:36.310
<v Josh Sparkes>Other matter, QA, QA.
So that's a main current. Yes. So it's.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/733-1
02:44:36.310 --> 02:44:42.911
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, the one that's highlighted just now.
So this is generally speaking this is a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/733-2
02:44:42.911 --> 02:44:44.979
<v Josh Sparkes>task that's in three-week.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/734-0
02:44:45.259 --> 02:44:49.712
<v Josh Sparkes>So a bit like the new peers.
So against the E we'll pull that report.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/734-1
02:44:49.712 --> 02:44:54.674
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll do that several times a day and we
can see a big list of matters that's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/734-2
02:44:54.674 --> 02:44:59.064
<v Josh Sparkes>waiting to be made current.
We'll philtre that because the only ones</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/734-3
02:44:59.064 --> 02:45:03.899
<v Josh Sparkes>that we can make current are and I'm
telling this reason are kind of in QA.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/735-0
02:45:04.539 --> 02:45:09.279
<v Josh Sparkes>We will go in to see do the necessarily
cheques that we need to do and then we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/735-1
02:45:09.279 --> 02:45:12.999
<v Josh Sparkes>make it current and that's fine.
So there's no for that part.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/735-2
02:45:12.999 --> 02:45:17.199
<v Josh Sparkes>There's it doesn't touch share will at
all. You get no queries to it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/735-3
02:45:17.199 --> 02:45:21.099
<v Josh Sparkes>It's an activity we do.
But just what we should happen is that's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/735-4
02:45:21.099 --> 02:45:23.739
<v Josh Sparkes>what happens.
But then what will happen is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/736-0
02:45:23.859 --> 02:45:28.220
<v Josh Sparkes>Because people weren't rushed through,
so they'll then send an e-mail to us and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/736-1
02:45:28.220 --> 02:45:31.546
<v Josh Sparkes>say, can you make it current?
And that's the change is that,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/736-2
02:45:31.546 --> 02:45:35.308
<v Josh Sparkes>that they shouldn't be. Well,
it depends because sometimes they just</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/736-3
02:45:35.308 --> 02:45:37.816
<v Josh Sparkes>need it, like,
OK quicker than service level.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/736-4
02:45:37.816 --> 02:45:39.179
<v Josh Sparkes>So we will get a request.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/737-0
02:45:41.579 --> 02:45:47.476
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's when we do exactly what we
done earlier. And if we pull the report,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/737-1
02:45:47.476 --> 02:45:52.999
<v Josh Sparkes>find find matter or we go in to the
matter and we check the matter and we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/737-2
02:45:52.999 --> 02:45:58.299
<v Josh Sparkes>make it current and the challenges we
probably have here when this is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/738-0
02:45:58.499 --> 02:46:04.656
<v Josh Sparkes>That we can only do make it current if
the status is pending QA and often the PE</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/738-1
02:46:04.656 --> 02:46:08.837
<v Josh Sparkes>it's usually PE will request it and it's
other status,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/738-2
02:46:08.837 --> 02:46:14.386
<v Josh Sparkes>so it could be pending this one which
means it's sitting with compliance</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/738-3
02:46:14.386 --> 02:46:18.339
<v Josh Sparkes>pending rec,
which means there's other information.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/739-0
02:46:18.459 --> 02:46:21.607
<v Josh Sparkes>Required from actually the person who
opened it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/739-1
02:46:21.607 --> 02:46:25.398
<v Josh Sparkes>The key has the ability to look on to the
Ian, check what?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/739-2
02:46:25.398 --> 02:46:30.796
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the same bit that was saying before.
Yeah, you can have that leading question.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/739-3
02:46:30.796 --> 02:46:34.587
<v Josh Sparkes>Have you? I mean,
obviously that they're saying yes before</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/739-4
02:46:34.587 --> 02:46:36.579
<v Josh Sparkes>subject. Yeah. But it could be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/740-0
02:46:37.179 --> 02:46:39.597
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
at that point they've got supporting</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/740-1
02:46:39.597 --> 02:46:43.520
<v Josh Sparkes>evidence that it says that, yeah,
that will get some rid of some of that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/740-2
02:46:43.520 --> 02:46:45.616
<v Josh Sparkes>noise.
So maybe I'll draw that sort of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/740-3
02:46:45.616 --> 02:46:48.464
<v Josh Sparkes>educational piece on that, that you don't,
you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/740-4
02:46:48.464 --> 02:46:50.829
<v Josh Sparkes>it is only they should be doing and can
do.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/740-5
02:46:50.829 --> 02:46:53.892
<v Josh Sparkes>And we're trying to reduce that noise and
those tickets.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/740-6
02:46:53.892 --> 02:46:56.579
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the knowledge piece and I have got a
lot to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/741-0
02:46:56.779 --> 02:46:59.936
<v Josh Sparkes>That I've gave the team to respond when
it's not a pending QE.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/741-1
02:46:59.936 --> 02:47:03.996
<v Josh Sparkes>We're trying to let them know if it's not
pending QE, we can't do anything. Why?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/741-2
02:47:03.996 --> 02:47:07.805
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, it's probably that reason. Yeah,
I'm just going to answer it anyway</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/741-3
02:47:07.805 --> 02:47:10.110
<v Josh Sparkes>because it's going to reason, you know?
Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/741-4
02:47:10.110 --> 02:47:13.619
<v Josh Sparkes>given in the background of why they can't
do it. We're sorry this is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/742-0
02:47:14.019 --> 02:47:17.497
<v Josh Sparkes>In the next one step was compliant,
so we we just let them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/742-1
02:47:17.497 --> 02:47:22.366
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a little template to see if we have
where it is and what it is doing. So yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/742-2
02:47:22.366 --> 02:47:27.061
<v Josh Sparkes>so we we we get we do get a lot of these
where they're wanting them done, right,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/742-3
02:47:27.061 --> 02:47:30.539
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, really quickly and that's fine.
We get loads of them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/743-0
02:47:32.019 --> 02:47:36.773
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, just good for them. Go back.
So in three, you can manage that. I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/743-1
02:47:36.773 --> 02:47:41.465
<v Josh Sparkes>that's why I manage it every day. Yeah,
that's what you're managing anyway.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/743-2
02:47:41.465 --> 02:47:46.589
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's capturing those ad hoc requests
that may come. So we're working on three.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/743-3
02:47:46.589 --> 02:47:49.059
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes. So we get the request, but ideally.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/744-0
02:47:49.859 --> 02:47:54.725
<v Josh Sparkes>They should know before they put the
request and it's actually claiming QA.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/744-1
02:47:54.725 --> 02:47:59.528
<v Josh Sparkes>Otherwise we can't do anything.
So that would be a great thing to capture.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/744-2
02:47:59.528 --> 02:48:04.139
<v Josh Sparkes>I just ask who changes that status ending
QA? That would be compliance.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/745-0
02:48:04.939 --> 02:48:09.598
<v Josh Sparkes>So they do their cheques. Yeah.
So it goes through different theories</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/745-1
02:48:09.598 --> 02:48:14.458
<v Josh Sparkes>cheques before it comes to us.
And when it's a pending is one that means</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/745-2
02:48:14.458 --> 02:48:18.319
<v Josh Sparkes>it's less compliance.
They may change it to pending wreck</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/745-3
02:48:18.319 --> 02:48:22.579
<v Josh Sparkes>because they need more information from
whether it's open that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/746-0
02:48:23.059 --> 02:48:27.295
<v Josh Sparkes>When they change it to pending QE,
it then sets with us.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/746-1
02:48:27.295 --> 02:48:31.382
<v Josh Sparkes>We need to make it current.
We have to do some change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/746-2
02:48:31.382 --> 02:48:36.212
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm just thinking in three EI think.
So when you're in three,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/746-3
02:48:36.212 --> 02:48:39.259
<v Josh Sparkes>the fact that it's gone to pending QA is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/747-0
02:48:39.659 --> 02:48:43.854
<v Josh Sparkes>Is your roles and responsibilities in
three today, isn't it? Yes, I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/747-1
02:48:43.854 --> 02:48:46.745
<v Josh Sparkes>you probably don't want more noticeable.
You know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/747-2
02:48:46.745 --> 02:48:49.466
<v Josh Sparkes>that's what that's outside of service now.
Yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/747-3
02:48:49.466 --> 02:48:53.150
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm sure that you want to track how many
times you've done that,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/747-4
02:48:53.150 --> 02:48:57.629
<v Josh Sparkes>because that can be tracked in three.
You don't need a task to tell you you're</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/747-5
02:48:57.629 --> 02:48:58.139
<v Josh Sparkes>going on.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/748-0
02:48:59.299 --> 02:49:03.719
<v Josh Sparkes>At least just a bucket for capturing
those that somebody else said and you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/748-1
02:49:03.719 --> 02:49:07.373
<v Josh Sparkes>make the matter current.
But it sounds like you're doing that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/748-2
02:49:07.373 --> 02:49:11.085
<v Josh Sparkes>anyway, but they want it quicker. Yeah.
Yeah, they want. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/748-3
02:49:11.085 --> 02:49:14.150
<v Josh Sparkes>Here's an escalation of. Yes,
they want it quicker.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/748-4
02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:16.979
<v Josh Sparkes>And and then obviously we need to start
seeing.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/749-0
02:49:17.619 --> 02:49:21.985
<v Josh Sparkes>Can't do it because it's not an
educational piece on them and you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/749-1
02:49:21.985 --> 02:49:25.442
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, with the life cycle. Yeah,
of that matter, anyway.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/749-2
02:49:25.442 --> 02:49:28.293
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's probably a whole piece of
creation,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/749-3
02:49:28.293 --> 02:49:33.206
<v Josh Sparkes>the life cycle that they can go through.
And it's the same actually for changing</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/749-4
02:49:33.206 --> 02:49:36.299
<v Josh Sparkes>rates from 10 to last for rates to be
changed and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/751-0
02:49:36.619 --> 02:49:40.105
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the same reason it's not current yet.
OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/751-1
02:49:40.105 --> 02:49:46.187
<v Josh Sparkes>for for the QA is it's just from three E
it doesn't go through. Sure. Well, yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/751-2
02:49:46.187 --> 02:49:51.380
<v Josh Sparkes>we get all the I talk. Yeah.
But is is it something you guys can pick</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/751-3
02:49:51.380 --> 02:49:55.979
<v Josh Sparkes>it up on your list with the 3E guys when
you meet them about.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/752-0
02:49:56.459 --> 02:50:00.925
<v Josh Sparkes>Integration piece? Well,
I'm just thinking that it's it's,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/752-1
02:50:00.925 --> 02:50:04.937
<v Josh Sparkes>it's in theory. Look,
it's a we're not providing us,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/752-2
02:50:04.937 --> 02:50:10.842
<v Josh Sparkes>we're sort of it's a reactive services
and this is in service now I'm sort of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/752-3
02:50:10.842 --> 02:50:12.659
<v Josh Sparkes>challenging the service.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/753-0
02:50:12.899 --> 02:50:16.280
<v Josh Sparkes>As it were,
these are in three as a life cycle.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/753-1
02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:21.703
<v Josh Sparkes>So in that system and it's the fact that
people are asking for it to be done</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/753-2
02:50:21.703 --> 02:50:25.084
<v Josh Sparkes>quicker,
even though the life cycle hasn't been</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/753-3
02:50:25.084 --> 02:50:28.254
<v Josh Sparkes>complete.
So it could be and it's sat there,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/753-4
02:50:28.254 --> 02:50:29.099
<v Josh Sparkes>isn't it in.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/754-0
02:50:29.499 --> 02:50:33.471
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, pending wreck.
It's not that you can move it even if you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/754-1
02:50:33.471 --> 02:50:37.383
<v Josh Sparkes>get that, you get that.
But I think the the two areas why I would</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/754-2
02:50:37.383 --> 02:50:41.889
<v Josh Sparkes>want this and I wish it could be on
ServiceNow is because a it goes through</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/754-3
02:50:41.889 --> 02:50:45.979
<v Josh Sparkes>multiple statuses and not everybody knows
in what statuses they are.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/754-4
02:50:45.979 --> 02:50:49.299
<v Josh Sparkes>So they would be completely hammering us
and asking us.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/755-0
02:50:49.379 --> 02:50:53.624
<v Josh Sparkes>To get it done quickly,
whereas it would be sitting somewhere</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/755-1
02:50:53.624 --> 02:50:58.006
<v Josh Sparkes>else and be on a wider picture of
capacity which is being used.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/755-2
02:50:58.006 --> 02:51:03.621
<v Josh Sparkes>So if ServiceNow is gonna give me the you
know the the the MI around you know the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/755-3
02:51:03.621 --> 02:51:08.551
<v Josh Sparkes>team efficiencies and capacity,
this piece of work will be outside that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/755-4
02:51:08.551 --> 02:51:09.099
<v Josh Sparkes>whereas.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/756-0
02:51:09.459 --> 02:51:15.164
<v Josh Sparkes>Just don't have no time on on QAS and it
is a high volume driven activity as well</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/756-1
02:51:15.164 --> 02:51:20.660
<v Josh Sparkes>so I'm missing out on that big time.
You know that the full picture? No. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/756-2
02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:24.139
<v Josh Sparkes>OK for that. Yeah.
You can get back the capacity.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/757-0
02:51:24.939 --> 02:51:28.931
<v Josh Sparkes>And to be fair,
you know one saying that gets through the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/757-1
02:51:28.931 --> 02:51:32.442
<v Josh Sparkes>business,
so we should we try and complete the QES</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/757-2
02:51:32.442 --> 02:51:37.743
<v Josh Sparkes>that are in kind of QE 2 current within
two days, but that might not happen.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/757-3
02:51:37.743 --> 02:51:42.355
<v Josh Sparkes>So we could be chasing legitly and we and
then that tells us, yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/757-4
02:51:42.355 --> 02:51:43.939
<v Josh Sparkes>we're going to do that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/758-0
02:51:44.659 --> 02:51:50.202
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a good point. Thank you for that.
Yeah, apart that. But we can look at that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/758-1
02:51:50.202 --> 02:51:55.678
<v Josh Sparkes>Useless. Yeah, the use case. Perfect. No,
the next one has just changed and are in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/758-2
02:51:55.678 --> 02:51:59.835
<v Josh Sparkes>the process of change.
And that'll send you to Sandeep, right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/758-3
02:51:59.835 --> 02:52:02.739
<v Josh Sparkes>I suppose off. Yes.
I'm just thinking that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/759-0
02:52:04.179 --> 02:52:08.802
<v Josh Sparkes>So it comes in and you you can either do
it or not do it because you know. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/759-1
02:52:08.802 --> 02:52:12.626
<v Josh Sparkes>With that we have and then you might work
on your series of tasks.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/759-2
02:52:12.626 --> 02:52:17.364
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just thinking then do then obviously
you've got all the tasks that you need to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/759-3
02:52:17.364 --> 02:52:19.019
<v Josh Sparkes>do in order to move it. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/760-0
02:52:19.859 --> 02:52:23.867
<v Josh Sparkes>But therefore I don't know if you want a
checklist and so now that each of them</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/760-1
02:52:23.867 --> 02:52:27.575
<v Josh Sparkes>are done so you can see it on the
dashboard or if you need to reassign it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/760-2
02:52:27.575 --> 02:52:31.634
<v Josh Sparkes>to someone else because of month end that
you can say, well, I've done task 123,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/760-3
02:52:31.634 --> 02:52:34.891
<v Josh Sparkes>can you do 4-5 and six for me and it's
great if you're going to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/760-4
02:52:34.891 --> 02:52:37.496
<v Josh Sparkes>So when you pull the report,
you're going to do it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/760-5
02:52:37.496 --> 02:52:38.699
<v Josh Sparkes>you're going to do that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/761-0
02:52:39.139 --> 02:52:43.632
<v Josh Sparkes>You you don't you think that's 6 minutes?
You know to do so? OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/761-1
02:52:43.632 --> 02:52:47.433
<v Josh Sparkes>And so you would sit and you could do
that one matter.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/761-2
02:52:47.433 --> 02:52:52.894
<v Josh Sparkes>And in regards to are you so I guess are
you thinking about allocating certain</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/761-3
02:52:52.894 --> 02:52:54.899
<v Josh Sparkes>tickets to certain levels of?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/762-0
02:52:55.379 --> 02:52:58.946
<v Josh Sparkes>People maybe potentially that's what I
would say, yeah, OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/762-1
02:52:58.946 --> 02:53:03.761
<v Josh Sparkes>Eventually that is one that we wouldn't
give to a newish person. Yeah. You know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/762-2
02:53:03.761 --> 02:53:08.338
<v Josh Sparkes>once something's been trained fully,
then then anybody you can set that make</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/762-3
02:53:08.338 --> 02:53:13.094
<v Josh Sparkes>sure anyway that it wouldn't be as you
said that there might be a subsection of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/762-4
02:53:13.094 --> 02:53:14.699
<v Josh Sparkes>the tier get to and we can.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/763-0
02:53:14.939 --> 02:53:15.259
<v Josh Sparkes>That was.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/764-0
02:53:16.299 --> 02:53:20.638
<v Josh Sparkes>And it can't be reassigned to anybody.
It can then be reassigned. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/764-1
02:53:20.638 --> 02:53:24.374
<v Josh Sparkes>more in if it took, like, for example,
half an hour for each,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/764-2
02:53:24.374 --> 02:53:28.774
<v Josh Sparkes>but you're paying doesn't. Yeah,
it was the fact that you could say it's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/764-3
02:53:28.774 --> 02:53:33.294
<v Josh Sparkes>work in progress and wherever you
reassign it to could see how much of it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/764-4
02:53:33.294 --> 02:53:34.379
<v Josh Sparkes>We wouldn't do it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/765-0
02:53:35.379 --> 02:53:39.261
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's just done. Yeah. Yeah.
So we do the cheques, make it cut in,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/765-1
02:53:39.261 --> 02:53:41.811
<v Josh Sparkes>and then we would see this is no cutting.
OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/765-2
02:53:41.811 --> 02:53:46.137
<v Josh Sparkes>And then it can on complete the new
request, it gets informed that it's done,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/765-3
02:53:46.137 --> 02:53:50.019
<v Josh Sparkes>OK and it's been completed in three years.
Yeah, that's good. OK. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/766-0
02:53:51.779 --> 02:53:55.343
<v Josh Sparkes>So the next one high volume matters.
So they're very,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/766-1
02:53:55.343 --> 02:53:59.633
<v Josh Sparkes>very similar to the previous one. Yeah,
if you write more. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/766-2
02:53:59.633 --> 02:54:04.715
<v Josh Sparkes>It's very similar that the difference
since here was that we probably didn't</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/766-3
02:54:04.715 --> 02:54:08.081
<v Josh Sparkes>take us as long to do because the win
reads to us.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/766-4
02:54:08.081 --> 02:54:10.259
<v Josh Sparkes>There was other cheques to do so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/767-0
02:54:10.659 --> 02:54:14.293
<v Josh Sparkes>They're very similar.
They were just called high volume because</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/767-1
02:54:14.293 --> 02:54:17.701
<v Josh Sparkes>there's different cheques that you do
with the Fe, however,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/767-2
02:54:17.701 --> 02:54:21.449
<v Josh Sparkes>and you haven't made of this.
But I don't think could you been on</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/767-3
02:54:21.449 --> 02:54:24.346
<v Josh Sparkes>holiday,
you know where we have got certain people</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/767-4
02:54:24.346 --> 02:54:28.435
<v Josh Sparkes>who are now going to treat these matters
themselves out with our teams,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/767-5
02:54:28.435 --> 02:54:30.139
<v Josh Sparkes>these how high volume matters.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/768-0
02:54:32.099 --> 02:54:39.899
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's just being approved yesterday.
Yeah. What constitutes a high volume?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/768-1
02:54:39.899 --> 02:54:45.846
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's basically and then come in and
there's lots of them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/768-2
02:54:45.846 --> 02:54:49.259
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the way that they come in.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/769-0
02:54:49.739 --> 02:54:52.862
<v Josh Sparkes>How it's done?
It doesn't have the right partner in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/769-1
02:54:52.862 --> 02:54:55.565
<v Josh Sparkes>there,
so we have to make sure we update the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/769-2
02:54:55.565 --> 02:55:00.610
<v Josh Sparkes>right part of depending on the client and
the right location to get the bill in all</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/769-3
02:55:00.610 --> 02:55:03.072
<v Josh Sparkes>correct.
So once before like that proper</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/769-4
02:55:03.072 --> 02:55:07.517
<v Josh Sparkes>validations and the partner should be
correct or would need to add rates.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/769-5
02:55:07.517 --> 02:55:09.139
<v Josh Sparkes>What is that one we had to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/770-0
02:55:09.219 --> 02:55:14.288
<v Josh Sparkes>To make changes so somebody would begin
in to interact and doing this,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/770-1
02:55:14.288 --> 02:55:20.142
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's not pulling through correctly I
suppose and and then we had to make some</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/770-2
02:55:20.142 --> 02:55:24.141
<v Josh Sparkes>changes. However,
spoke about internal matters earlier,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/770-3
02:55:24.141 --> 02:55:28.139
<v Josh Sparkes>which which we do.
So this team of people who normally.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/771-0
02:55:28.939 --> 02:55:34.129
<v Josh Sparkes>But these matters through Insapp are now
going to be able to go into 3E and create</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/771-1
02:55:34.129 --> 02:55:37.756
<v Josh Sparkes>this themselves,
which means we won't be involved, right?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/771-2
02:55:37.756 --> 02:55:42.008
<v Josh Sparkes>So is that basically taken?
We going to be the administrators of it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/771-3
02:55:42.008 --> 02:55:45.635
<v Josh Sparkes>now. So although we're not involved,
if there's any, yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/771-4
02:55:45.635 --> 02:55:48.699
<v Josh Sparkes>So if there's any issues and we'll deal
with it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/772-0
02:55:48.819 --> 02:55:53.272
<v Josh Sparkes>If the particular client's not showing,
we will create a template and if the E</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/772-1
02:55:53.272 --> 02:55:56.372
<v Josh Sparkes>billing is not correct,
we will then create templates.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/772-2
02:55:56.372 --> 02:56:00.769
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll be doing an administrative
background for queries which will be very</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/772-3
02:56:00.769 --> 02:56:04.151
<v Josh Sparkes>different to this, OK.
And so we can pick up some knowledge</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/772-4
02:56:04.151 --> 02:56:06.800
<v Josh Sparkes>piece on that. Yeah,
it's literally yesterday.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/772-5
02:56:06.800 --> 02:56:08.379
<v Josh Sparkes>So we're all right, we will.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/773-0
02:56:08.659 --> 02:56:13.100
<v Josh Sparkes>To get that up as a,
make sure that we're capturing that. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/773-1
02:56:13.100 --> 02:56:16.084
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
I'm just asking a quick question a wee</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/773-2
02:56:16.084 --> 02:56:20.734
<v Josh Sparkes>bit off topic for this,
but it's still to do it for I'm obviously,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/773-3
02:56:20.734 --> 02:56:26.356
<v Josh Sparkes>am I right and saying that depending on
who the request has came from depends on</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/773-4
02:56:26.356 --> 02:56:28.299
<v Josh Sparkes>how you resolve the request?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/774-0
02:56:28.699 --> 02:56:32.584
<v Josh Sparkes>The only reason I'm asking is I was
helping with sample checking a wee while</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/774-1
02:56:32.584 --> 02:56:36.771
<v Josh Sparkes>ago for Rama and I remembered like if it
was maybe like a partner or a fear or you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/774-2
02:56:36.771 --> 02:56:39.445
<v Josh Sparkes>need to send like a manual personal life
resolution.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/774-3
02:56:39.445 --> 02:56:43.582
<v Josh Sparkes>Whereas if it's maybe a different someone
else you just resolve it or is that not</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/774-4
02:56:43.582 --> 02:56:46.811
<v Josh Sparkes>even a thing anymore? No.
Although I've been trying to suit the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/774-5
02:56:46.811 --> 02:56:47.619
<v Josh Sparkes>team to make it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/775-0
02:56:48.459 --> 02:56:48.579
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/776-0
02:56:48.659 --> 02:56:52.520
<v Josh Sparkes>Like reply anyway to make it a bit more
user friendly sort of thing,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/776-1
02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:55.765
<v Josh Sparkes>but you could do.
You can have your notification for this</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/776-2
02:56:55.765 --> 02:56:59.458
<v Josh Sparkes>polite yeah modelling behaviour for
everybody. Yeah, I mean well,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/776-3
02:56:59.458 --> 02:57:03.263
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm assuming that's what's going to
happen anyways. Yeah. You know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/776-4
02:57:03.263 --> 02:57:06.396
<v Josh Sparkes>you're a partner,
doesn't you get to have more manners.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/776-5
02:57:06.396 --> 02:57:08.579
<v Josh Sparkes>So it could be a standard notification.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/777-0
02:57:08.659 --> 02:57:11.729
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's, you know,
services everybody in that in that same</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/777-1
02:57:11.729 --> 02:57:14.304
<v Josh Sparkes>way. Yeah.
Because in something and Melbourne don't</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/777-2
02:57:14.304 --> 02:57:18.118
<v Josh Sparkes>know that's it was I just I don't know
why I just thought of it when we were</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/777-3
02:57:18.118 --> 02:57:22.030
<v Josh Sparkes>talking about resolves I just wanted to
check because I know obviously when we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/777-4
02:57:22.030 --> 02:57:26.042
<v Josh Sparkes>resolved the case it just seems like a
standard resolve notification there's not</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/777-5
02:57:26.042 --> 02:57:27.379
<v Josh Sparkes>much information in it but.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/778-0
02:57:28.299 --> 02:57:32.508
<v Josh Sparkes>You are in emails. Yeah,
we're just like what you don't want is in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/778-1
02:57:32.508 --> 02:57:36.591
<v Josh Sparkes>again. As the recipient.
You're also creating a reputation and a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/778-2
02:57:36.591 --> 02:57:40.297
<v Josh Sparkes>service. I understand those complete.
What does that mean?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/778-3
02:57:40.297 --> 02:57:44.694
<v Josh Sparkes>It can be tailored in such a way,
you know, with the subject heading.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/778-4
02:57:44.694 --> 02:57:46.579
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, what's it come from?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/779-0
02:57:47.059 --> 02:57:53.341
<v Josh Sparkes>It you know, it can be well laid out,
but it feels like you have not received</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/779-1
02:57:53.341 --> 02:57:58.255
<v Josh Sparkes>an automatic build personalised,
even though it's been auto.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/779-2
02:57:58.255 --> 02:58:02.443
<v Josh Sparkes>It's it's it's very subjective and
comparing, yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/779-3
02:58:02.443 --> 02:58:04.779
<v Josh Sparkes>comparing different partners.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/780-0
02:58:05.259 --> 02:58:08.554
<v Josh Sparkes>And moreover,
comparing different locations,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/780-1
02:58:08.554 --> 02:58:13.900
<v Josh Sparkes>we have an individual from Glasgow
working in Brisbane writing emails to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/780-2
02:58:13.900 --> 02:58:19.979
<v Josh Sparkes>senior operations managers in a very nice,
polite manner and there is to complain.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/781-0
02:58:20.579 --> 02:58:21.859
<v Josh Sparkes>So does case late.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/782-0
02:58:23.099 --> 02:58:26.170
<v Josh Sparkes>Not fuzzy. What do you want? You know,
like, I mean.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/782-1
02:58:26.170 --> 02:58:30.865
<v Josh Sparkes>And then I I saw the e-mail and I was
like, I went to my management. I was like,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/782-2
02:58:30.865 --> 02:58:33.763
<v Josh Sparkes>what's wrong?
And and it was a proper escalation.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/782-3
02:58:33.763 --> 02:58:37.298
<v Josh Sparkes>So it depends, you know,
like how you want to deal with that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/782-4
02:58:37.298 --> 02:58:40.486
<v Josh Sparkes>individual, to be honest with you,
we can come across.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/782-5
02:58:40.486 --> 02:58:41.819
<v Josh Sparkes>We can standardise the.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/783-0
02:58:42.059 --> 02:58:45.148
<v Josh Sparkes>So that is, I mean,
that's probably All in all. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/783-1
02:58:45.148 --> 02:58:49.496
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, we talk to each other.
It's it's a very individual team specific.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/783-2
02:58:49.496 --> 02:58:52.986
<v Josh Sparkes>You know how they want in.
So Cassius for example yesterday,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/783-3
02:58:52.986 --> 02:58:56.361
<v Josh Sparkes>like they won't have time to say hello.
How are you doing?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/783-4
02:58:56.361 --> 02:59:00.938
<v Josh Sparkes>And all it would be just one more answer
for them. Yeah. I don't know to. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/783-5
02:59:00.938 --> 02:59:01.339
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/785-0
02:59:01.819 --> 02:59:04.750
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, I yeah, we'll print some place.
Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/785-1
02:59:04.750 --> 02:59:09.018
<v Josh Sparkes>They should rather than just so yeah,
just system generic. I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/785-2
02:59:09.018 --> 02:59:13.096
<v Josh Sparkes>personally on that note,
I don't particularly like receiving an</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/785-3
02:59:13.096 --> 02:59:15.963
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail that's that's higher in was
expected.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/785-4
02:59:15.963 --> 02:59:20.805
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm guessing that there's also going to
be standardised just oncees but I'm</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/785-5
02:59:20.805 --> 02:59:21.379
<v Josh Sparkes>guessing.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/786-0
02:59:21.459 --> 02:59:24.882
<v Josh Sparkes>And we could have that add to it if we
need to,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/786-1
02:59:24.882 --> 02:59:30.089
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean or or like that then just be
declined manually if if it's not the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/786-2
02:59:30.089 --> 02:59:34.938
<v Josh Sparkes>standard overhead of Matt,
I mean you want you know, you know yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/786-3
02:59:34.938 --> 02:59:36.579
<v Josh Sparkes>so much overheads here.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/787-0
02:59:37.219 --> 02:59:40.986
<v Josh Sparkes>Could be, you know,
maybe the template says plus field notes</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/787-1
02:59:40.986 --> 02:59:45.741
<v Josh Sparkes>and then you answer that that tends to be
that we want you want to be moving</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/787-2
02:59:45.741 --> 02:59:49.015
<v Josh Sparkes>towards a sort of a general language that
you. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/787-3
02:59:49.015 --> 02:59:53.894
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm sure that it can take some of the
workload way as well because you have to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/787-4
02:59:53.894 --> 02:59:56.179
<v Josh Sparkes>respond and have it in a certain way.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/788-0
02:59:56.739 --> 03:00:00.576
<v Josh Sparkes>But we can tailor the notifications so it
doesn't fill system just sent in.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/788-1
03:00:00.576 --> 03:00:03.353
<v Josh Sparkes>That's it. Yeah.
So we build those templates that way.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/788-2
03:00:03.353 --> 03:00:06.080
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the majority of them,
that's absolutely fine.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/788-3
03:00:06.080 --> 03:00:10.120
<v Josh Sparkes>That for that is ones that's probably
come across as queries that are so random</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/788-4
03:00:10.120 --> 03:00:12.644
<v Josh Sparkes>and different.
I think they would have to be more</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/788-5
03:00:12.644 --> 03:00:15.522
<v Josh Sparkes>tailored. Yeah.
And there'll be times where you can send</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/788-6
03:00:15.522 --> 03:00:16.179
<v Josh Sparkes>out your own.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/789-0
03:00:16.459 --> 03:00:19.051
<v Josh Sparkes>But it would be directly from the cases
of the request.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/789-1
03:00:19.051 --> 03:00:22.570
<v Josh Sparkes>So that way you can kind of keep it
related and can pull information all to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/789-2
03:00:22.570 --> 03:00:25.579
<v Josh Sparkes>pass before you rather than have to
complete everything as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/790-0
03:00:27.339 --> 03:00:29.899
<v Josh Sparkes>But actually you'll probably find me with
time that that's.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/791-0
03:00:32.299 --> 03:00:36.228
<v Josh Sparkes>You'll probably send me emails at the
same play, but you get each.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/791-1
03:00:36.228 --> 03:00:39.981
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just like adjustment,
but after a while people get used to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/791-2
03:00:39.981 --> 03:00:44.555
<v Josh Sparkes>repeating these. Yeah, comfortable.
But it's just saying that it's a category</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/791-3
03:00:44.555 --> 03:00:48.542
<v Josh Sparkes>there where it's comes under query
keeping anything and everything.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/791-4
03:00:48.542 --> 03:00:50.419
<v Josh Sparkes>So your response is going to be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/792-0
03:00:50.859 --> 03:00:54.547
<v Josh Sparkes>Based on like that, yeah,
it'd be a manual. 1:00 today. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/792-1
03:00:54.547 --> 03:00:58.950
<v Josh Sparkes>we're trying to get some actually
slightly different that we are going to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/792-2
03:00:58.950 --> 03:01:03.709
<v Josh Sparkes>be the scenario for the same thing. Yeah,
I don't think we get something you're</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/792-3
03:01:03.709 --> 03:01:08.290
<v Josh Sparkes>going to get because 52 or 5050 balls.
We are still managing it as a service</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/792-4
03:01:08.290 --> 03:01:09.659
<v Josh Sparkes>that you will see them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/793-0
03:01:10.299 --> 03:01:18.555
<v Josh Sparkes>And there's scenarios of of that. So yeah,
we can get that's high volume. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/793-1
03:01:18.555 --> 03:01:25.779
<v Josh Sparkes>that was above. Yes, yes, we've done that.
I'm looking to the reason.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/794-0
03:01:27.339 --> 03:01:30.657
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh yeah, that's right.
And then we should have a look at that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/794-1
03:01:30.657 --> 03:01:34.133
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's the right side. No,
you don't make that all right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/794-2
03:01:34.133 --> 03:01:36.978
<v Josh Sparkes>Rates matter. Pending matter rates.
It's got address.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/794-3
03:01:36.978 --> 03:01:40.507
<v Josh Sparkes>I think so that comes under rates.
And then we've got this address</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/794-4
03:01:40.507 --> 03:01:41.139
<v Josh Sparkes>maintenance.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/795-0
03:01:43.499 --> 03:01:46.435
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that from the client?
So is that I would be, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/795-1
03:01:46.435 --> 03:01:48.339
<v Josh Sparkes>I would probably say that would be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/796-0
03:01:50.419 --> 03:01:54.214
<v Josh Sparkes>Could be matter or because payer
maintenance issue. It says.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/796-1
03:01:54.214 --> 03:01:59.254
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean there's some of them that you see
that you might say actually we don't do</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/796-2
03:01:59.254 --> 03:02:02.614
<v Josh Sparkes>that process.
I've seen it could be client or matter,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/796-3
03:02:02.614 --> 03:02:07.219
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. So address maintenance yeah.
So should that sit with us or data team?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/797-0
03:02:07.899 --> 03:02:12.521
<v Josh Sparkes>No, that's us that that's definitely us.
So it's updating the address.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/797-1
03:02:12.521 --> 03:02:14.539
<v Josh Sparkes>Why can't it move to data team?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/798-0
03:02:16.059 --> 03:02:20.045
<v Josh Sparkes>It's usually down address,
should they not have access to the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/798-1
03:02:20.045 --> 03:02:23.645
<v Josh Sparkes>billing address.
There's this more head office where we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/798-2
03:02:23.645 --> 03:02:27.503
<v Josh Sparkes>actually fill in.
Is it something we can explore with them?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/798-3
03:02:27.503 --> 03:02:30.846
<v Josh Sparkes>Like, no,
we don't have any any billing address on.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/798-4
03:02:30.846 --> 03:02:33.739
<v Josh Sparkes>There's information on interactions
usually.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/800-0
03:02:34.179 --> 03:02:40.510
<v Josh Sparkes>Linked to head office and when you're
doing any matters so you get this.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/800-1
03:02:40.510 --> 03:02:45.019
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
I want to change the bill or yes or maybe</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/800-2
03:02:45.019 --> 03:02:52.391
<v Josh Sparkes>when you're linking. Maybe. Yeah. Or yeah.
Some of the transfer attend intend to get</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/800-3
03:02:52.391 --> 03:02:53.779
<v Josh Sparkes>a trigger is it?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/801-0
03:02:54.899 --> 03:02:58.732
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a request. OK, so yeah,
we we would never. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/801-1
03:02:58.732 --> 03:03:03.063
<v Josh Sparkes>we would never find it on occasion.
Billing might, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/801-2
03:03:03.063 --> 03:03:08.459
<v Josh Sparkes>but that they won't have found it because
PE is then said. But but I. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/802-0
03:03:11.059 --> 03:03:15.859
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a big it's a big issue as well for
the partners to get the bills across.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/803-0
03:03:18.739 --> 03:03:23.139
<v Josh Sparkes>For the right address. OK,
so it comes in from the PE new address</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/803-1
03:03:23.139 --> 03:03:26.205
<v Josh Sparkes>and it's not something they can do
obviously,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/803-2
03:03:26.205 --> 03:03:30.739
<v Josh Sparkes>but then something you can do and they've
given you and then again,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/803-3
03:03:30.739 --> 03:03:33.739
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just that you need the right of
course.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/804-0
03:03:34.019 --> 03:03:36.368
<v Josh Sparkes>You don't just want the post code you
want. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/804-1
03:03:36.368 --> 03:03:39.939
<v Josh Sparkes>of which few different countries.
Obviously there's different structures of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/804-2
03:03:39.939 --> 03:03:42.711
<v Josh Sparkes>address. We can't.
Maybe the end of it could be that often</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/804-3
03:03:42.711 --> 03:03:46.470
<v Josh Sparkes>that address is already in the system.
So we also will actually search for that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/804-4
03:03:46.470 --> 03:03:49.947
<v Josh Sparkes>under that client and is the new search
for that under that client or no,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/804-5
03:03:49.947 --> 03:03:53.283
<v Josh Sparkes>they can't search for any, OK.
So they would have the address and then</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/804-6
03:03:53.283 --> 03:03:53.659
<v Josh Sparkes>we just.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/805-0
03:03:54.539 --> 03:03:56.805
<v Josh Sparkes>You will check is it already in the
system, yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/805-1
03:03:56.805 --> 03:03:59.718
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll just click on that address if
it's not in the system,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/805-2
03:03:59.718 --> 03:04:02.863
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll then add it that that's one of
those where if we did have the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/805-3
03:04:02.863 --> 03:04:05.360
<v Josh Sparkes>integration,
you could see the lists of addresses and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/805-4
03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:08.413
<v Josh Sparkes>search them and selects it.
But if we don't have the integration,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/805-5
03:04:08.413 --> 03:04:09.939
<v Josh Sparkes>they're going to have to type in.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/806-0
03:04:10.819 --> 03:04:13.943
<v Josh Sparkes>So we want a new address with a yeah to
this one. I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/806-1
03:04:13.943 --> 03:04:18.036
<v Josh Sparkes>they don't have to give form because no,
no. Yeah. No, that. Yeah. Exactly.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/806-2
03:04:18.036 --> 03:04:21.268
<v Josh Sparkes>The address details.
And we'll check in the system that is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/806-3
03:04:21.268 --> 03:04:25.524
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll just like that one. If it's not,
we'll just add the new address and then</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/806-4
03:04:25.524 --> 03:04:29.779
<v Josh Sparkes>no approval. Just no approval. Yeah.
And you might get it. And they might say.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/807-0
03:04:30.579 --> 03:04:34.845
<v Josh Sparkes>We're just leaving questions on that.
It's a matter one or the primary.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/807-1
03:04:34.845 --> 03:04:38.579
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you get that on the secondary,
you know, so we would need,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/807-2
03:04:38.579 --> 03:04:42.312
<v Josh Sparkes>is it a client and matter,
it's generally a matter to be fair,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/807-3
03:04:42.312 --> 03:04:46.342
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not often and what's the decline or
matter number? Yeah, yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/807-4
03:04:46.342 --> 03:04:49.779
<v Josh Sparkes>we'd have to be careful with that one
because previously.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/808-0
03:04:49.859 --> 03:04:54.729
<v Josh Sparkes>They they've provided the client number
and if you change it client level it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/808-1
03:04:54.729 --> 03:04:59.537
<v Josh Sparkes>changes the address right across all the
matters and it messes it up. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/808-2
03:04:59.537 --> 03:05:04.028
<v Josh Sparkes>Are you sure you know? Yes.
Is it just the matter level? Yeah. I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/808-3
03:05:04.028 --> 03:05:08.899
<v Josh Sparkes>that's probably a large piece of the
impact of this. It will take, you know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/809-0
03:05:09.419 --> 03:05:09.779
<v Josh Sparkes>Going to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/810-0
03:05:10.099 --> 03:05:13.249
<v Josh Sparkes>Change it all. And yeah,
actually that's not what I want. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/810-1
03:05:13.249 --> 03:05:16.891
<v Josh Sparkes>it's OK. It's important on that.
And then you get the matter level. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/810-2
03:05:16.891 --> 03:05:20.977
<v Josh Sparkes>So we want to before going and literally
go back to the PES or the PES for all the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/810-3
03:05:20.977 --> 03:05:24.964
<v Josh Sparkes>matters and ask them what the address
should be. And it was a mass mass. I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/810-4
03:05:24.964 --> 03:05:28.902
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe that's a, you know, as you said,
because it's such a big issue if you try</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/810-5
03:05:28.902 --> 03:05:29.099
<v Josh Sparkes>and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/811-0
03:05:29.739 --> 03:05:34.184
<v Josh Sparkes>That isn't part of the cheques that you
are when you get those client again.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/811-1
03:05:34.184 --> 03:05:37.706
<v Josh Sparkes>If they can happen,
maybe there was a verbal or a check back</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/811-2
03:05:37.706 --> 03:05:41.171
<v Josh Sparkes>in. Are you sure? Yes.
At client level it sounds like that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/811-3
03:05:41.171 --> 03:05:45.559
<v Josh Sparkes>Then we use a level of approval,
doesn't it at client level? Address. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/811-4
03:05:45.559 --> 03:05:48.619
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Potentially. Yeah.
Because that sounds like a.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/812-0
03:05:48.939 --> 03:05:53.306
<v Josh Sparkes>This is the yeah, because it's affecting.
It goes through all. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/812-1
03:05:53.306 --> 03:05:54.699
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know who it's.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/813-0
03:05:56.419 --> 03:05:57.019
<v Josh Sparkes>The result?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/814-0
03:06:00.859 --> 03:06:04.476
<v Josh Sparkes>I think more it's it's more just,
it's just that matter level.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/814-1
03:06:04.476 --> 03:06:08.782
<v Josh Sparkes>What's the matter number and then
majority of those who are matching level</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/814-2
03:06:08.782 --> 03:06:12.974
<v Josh Sparkes>95% is is matter level presuming the
client doesn't tend to move no No2,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/814-3
03:06:12.974 --> 03:06:17.395
<v Josh Sparkes>all kinds, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But we we could just warn upfront. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/814-4
03:06:17.395 --> 03:06:19.979
<v Josh Sparkes>it's more definitely if it's going to.
Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/815-0
03:06:20.739 --> 03:06:22.811
<v Josh Sparkes>Geraldine,
I'm assuming there is a certain format</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/815-1
03:06:22.811 --> 03:06:25.877
<v Josh Sparkes>you need in terms of the address,
because I'm thinking if people give you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/815-2
03:06:25.877 --> 03:06:29.234
<v Josh Sparkes>different formats of their address and
you're going to have like duplicate ones,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/815-3
03:06:29.234 --> 03:06:32.259
<v Josh Sparkes>which is technically the same address,
but it's maybe different because.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/817-0
03:06:41.259 --> 03:06:44.859
<v Mark Sedge>I don't hear anything. Guys lost sound,
no worries.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/818-0
03:06:43.299 --> 03:06:46.262
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry.
So we'll set shipping maybe in 3E and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/818-1
03:06:46.262 --> 03:06:49.159
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll select it.
So it's formats all there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/818-2
03:06:49.159 --> 03:06:53.374
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's not in three E,
then we'll add it in the in the correct</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/818-3
03:06:53.374 --> 03:06:56.666
<v Josh Sparkes>format. But yeah, it's it's critical.
Yeah. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/818-4
03:06:56.666 --> 03:07:00.222
<v Josh Sparkes>Like short form of a country will get
rejected. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/818-5
03:07:00.222 --> 03:07:02.659
<v Josh Sparkes>And the same the same like depending.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/819-0
03:07:02.699 --> 03:07:06.595
<v Josh Sparkes>And then on the country might depend on
the format that you need. So is it?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/819-1
03:07:06.595 --> 03:07:10.799
<v Josh Sparkes>It's definitely even in terms of like you
know how here you've got address line 1</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/819-2
03:07:10.799 --> 03:07:14.592
<v Josh Sparkes>address line two, I think it's 18,
three launching other other oracles or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/819-3
03:07:14.592 --> 03:07:17.310
<v Josh Sparkes>something that it will have because of
this country,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/819-4
03:07:17.310 --> 03:07:21.462
<v Josh Sparkes>it will have a zip code or a post code or
I think Australia probably has a area.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/819-5
03:07:21.462 --> 03:07:22.539
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it does pick.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/820-0
03:07:22.619 --> 03:07:23.059
<v Josh Sparkes>Couple of.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/821-0
03:07:24.179 --> 03:07:27.971
<v Josh Sparkes>Not true variations.
Or anyway we can do that from a serious,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/821-1
03:07:27.971 --> 03:07:31.397
<v Josh Sparkes>no perspective.
The person that's requesting it because</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/821-2
03:07:31.397 --> 03:07:36.168
<v Josh Sparkes>we haven't got that integration will be
right in the address which they think</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/821-3
03:07:36.168 --> 03:07:40.572
<v Josh Sparkes>you're checking it against an already
existing address to change it to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/821-4
03:07:40.572 --> 03:07:41.979
<v Josh Sparkes>You're not entering it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/822-0
03:07:42.659 --> 03:07:45.696
<v Josh Sparkes>Manually we can. Yeah. Yeah.
So why there be?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/822-1
03:07:45.696 --> 03:07:50.847
<v Josh Sparkes>So we're basically checking if it's on
there on the system already. If it is,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/822-2
03:07:50.847 --> 03:07:54.478
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll select it. So that's done. If not,
then we will,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/822-3
03:07:54.478 --> 03:07:59.299
<v Josh Sparkes>we will that to the probably to your
point and how that year ended this.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/823-0
03:07:59.859 --> 03:08:04.105
<v Josh Sparkes>Because I'm just thinking from AI might
be thinking too much in it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/823-1
03:08:04.105 --> 03:08:08.976
<v Josh Sparkes>so apologies like I'm just thinking like
like you see post code here zip code</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/823-2
03:08:08.976 --> 03:08:12.348
<v Josh Sparkes>somewhere else.
How do we name that as a field on the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/823-3
03:08:12.348 --> 03:08:17.219
<v Josh Sparkes>form that we just put both post code
slash ZIP code and we could be location.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/824-0
03:08:18.219 --> 03:08:22.640
<v Josh Sparkes>Where is location and then it will give
you the appropriate. Right, OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/824-1
03:08:22.640 --> 03:08:27.676
<v Josh Sparkes>so we can base it on location. OK. Fab.
That's quite a mature solution to all the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/824-2
03:08:27.676 --> 03:08:32.282
<v Josh Sparkes>possible countries, whichever is relevant,
which is relevant. Sorry. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/824-3
03:08:32.282 --> 03:08:33.019
<v Josh Sparkes>Is is there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/825-0
03:08:33.539 --> 03:08:37.401
<v Josh Sparkes>If there's no integration, though,
and somebody's manually typing something</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/825-1
03:08:37.401 --> 03:08:40.857
<v Josh Sparkes>and you have to search it,
how often is it that you know they don't</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/825-2
03:08:40.857 --> 03:08:43.855
<v Josh Sparkes>find it and they add something,
but it actually did exist?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/825-3
03:08:43.855 --> 03:08:46.599
<v Josh Sparkes>They just didn't have exactly the right
inputs. Well,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/825-4
03:08:46.599 --> 03:08:50.004
<v Josh Sparkes>I think so because it's under a client.
So what the matter number,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/825-5
03:08:50.004 --> 03:08:52.139
<v Josh Sparkes>which falls under a client number? Oh, OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/826-0
03:08:52.499 --> 03:08:57.285
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's not like you'll get a list of
them under there, so you can match it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/826-1
03:08:57.285 --> 03:08:59.957
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
just like magnifying glasses down in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/826-2
03:08:59.957 --> 03:09:03.997
<v Josh Sparkes>scope. Yeah, that's there.
So although I have seen duplicates in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/826-3
03:09:03.997 --> 03:09:08.659
<v Josh Sparkes>there before, but probably low risk. Yeah.
Yeah, cool. It's what we would.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/827-0
03:09:09.379 --> 03:09:15.352
<v Josh Sparkes>Global everybody moving forward anyway.
OK, that's straightforward.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/827-1
03:09:15.352 --> 03:09:20.887
<v Josh Sparkes>So it could be, yeah,
just that mindful as we've just you know</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/827-2
03:09:20.887 --> 03:09:27.739
<v Josh Sparkes>if it's required the impact and then we
get changed and then we get notified.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/829-0
03:09:28.939 --> 03:09:33.980
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be that you've, you know,
it could be that you have a note on our</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/829-1
03:09:33.980 --> 03:09:36.937
<v Josh Sparkes>check box updated to,
you know incorrectly.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/829-2
03:09:36.937 --> 03:09:41.710
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be that you can move on them.
This the new address, but yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/829-3
03:09:41.710 --> 03:09:43.659
<v Josh Sparkes>it's something that you just.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/830-0
03:09:46.139 --> 03:09:50.839
<v Josh Sparkes>This is deducting no SLA on that.
Or is it just as you see that it needs to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/830-1
03:09:50.839 --> 03:09:55.663
<v Josh Sparkes>be no only date form so that the new
build is raised on a sort of these small</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/830-2
03:09:55.663 --> 03:09:58.632
<v Josh Sparkes>tasks.
We do try and get tasks completed within</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/830-3
03:09:58.632 --> 03:10:00.859
<v Josh Sparkes>4 hours for the small that's that's.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/831-0
03:10:01.219 --> 03:10:04.440
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so things are going to be reached or as</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/831-1
03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:08.173
<v Josh Sparkes>you say,
you're getting 430 in that window when no</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/831-2
03:10:08.173 --> 03:10:12.639
<v Josh Sparkes>one is online, we could.
It could be that that SLA takes the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/831-3
03:10:12.639 --> 03:10:17.910
<v Josh Sparkes>account that it the clock stops the
working hours and then it picks up.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/831-4
03:10:17.910 --> 03:10:20.619
<v Josh Sparkes>So you're not always reaching a 4:30.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/832-0
03:10:21.579 --> 03:10:25.964
<v Josh Sparkes>It depends if it is a bills a bill to be,
you know, sent out quickly,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/832-1
03:10:25.964 --> 03:10:29.911
<v Josh Sparkes>that mean I mean has to be done like
within minutes. It. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/832-2
03:10:29.911 --> 03:10:34.986
<v Josh Sparkes>And you ask for the reason for the I mean
the PE it could be reason for interest</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/832-3
03:10:34.986 --> 03:10:40.060
<v Josh Sparkes>change or urgent bill or no if if they've
got an urgent request they tend to put</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/832-4
03:10:40.060 --> 03:10:40.499
<v Josh Sparkes>urgent.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/833-0
03:10:41.459 --> 03:10:46.215
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I mean, I mean, and I think that,
you know, urgency is also subjective.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/833-1
03:10:46.215 --> 03:10:50.849
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can a bit like notification,
it's great, but it becomes white noise.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/833-2
03:10:50.849 --> 03:10:54.813
<v Josh Sparkes>So if everything's urgent,
nothing's urgent or if you say to the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/833-3
03:10:54.813 --> 03:10:59.874
<v Josh Sparkes>kids everyone's special and no one I want
you to have this discussion with OPS you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/833-4
03:10:59.874 --> 03:11:00.179
<v Josh Sparkes>know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/834-0
03:11:01.099 --> 03:11:03.733
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
we've had that discussion with somewhere</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/834-1
03:11:03.733 --> 03:11:07.769
<v Josh Sparkes>like every third one who's concludes
urgent. So that's what I'm saying.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/834-2
03:11:07.769 --> 03:11:12.198
<v Josh Sparkes>If you if you trigger the fact that it's
and if the drop down is urgent, bill,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/834-3
03:11:12.198 --> 03:11:16.514
<v Josh Sparkes>then of course then we can categorise
that it's that it has a priority where</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/834-4
03:11:16.514 --> 03:11:17.299
<v Josh Sparkes>it's you know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/835-0
03:11:18.099 --> 03:11:22.123
<v Josh Sparkes>General quests when just you know,
so you can use the system to prevent that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/835-1
03:11:22.123 --> 03:11:25.476
<v Josh Sparkes>Not everything becomes urgent because you
do have to prioritise.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/835-2
03:11:25.476 --> 03:11:29.501
<v Josh Sparkes>It'll be great on your queue to say that
this actually is an urgent priority.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/835-3
03:11:29.501 --> 03:11:31.874
<v Josh Sparkes>It's on your dashboard,
it's visible for all,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/835-4
03:11:31.874 --> 03:11:34.299
<v Josh Sparkes>and then you hit and you get to it fast,
yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/836-0
03:11:34.859 --> 03:11:35.619
<v Josh Sparkes>Alex, are you?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/837-0
03:11:38.059 --> 03:11:40.429
<v Josh Sparkes>No,
I was just going to say that that ties</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/837-1
03:11:40.429 --> 03:11:45.005
<v Josh Sparkes>into the whole VIP lane stuff that's came
out of all the previous weeks that needs</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/837-2
03:11:45.005 --> 03:11:49.526
<v Josh Sparkes>to be that facility, say this, you know,
this is a priority, this person's first.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/837-3
03:11:49.526 --> 03:11:53.055
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's just a similar.
I'm so trying to do that is that this</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/837-4
03:11:53.055 --> 03:11:54.819
<v Josh Sparkes>person's first is that based on.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/838-0
03:11:55.219 --> 03:11:59.883
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, I'm challenging about this. Oh,
that's you're quite right to challenge me</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/838-1
03:11:59.883 --> 03:12:02.500
<v Josh Sparkes>back.
All I'm saying is customs and behaviour</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/838-2
03:12:02.500 --> 03:12:06.255
<v Josh Sparkes>says this person is special.
They need to know that with, I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/838-3
03:12:06.255 --> 03:12:10.464
<v Josh Sparkes>we different behaviour lists personally
and we manage that. I would like,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/838-4
03:12:10.464 --> 03:12:14.219
<v Josh Sparkes>even if it is not an urgent query.
But if that VIP is sending an.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/839-0
03:12:14.379 --> 03:12:18.716
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, we'll just jump on it.
I think I would, I mean you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/839-1
03:12:18.716 --> 03:12:22.147
<v Josh Sparkes>see how how you have the in in IT,
how you have the,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/839-2
03:12:22.147 --> 03:12:25.513
<v Josh Sparkes>what do you call the the the matrix of
the tickets,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/839-3
03:12:25.513 --> 03:12:29.721
<v Josh Sparkes>you know like when it's AP1 incident P2,
it's something similar.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/839-4
03:12:29.721 --> 03:12:34.059
<v Josh Sparkes>As I say we probably would help yes,
because I mean look we don't.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/840-0
03:12:34.139 --> 03:12:34.499
<v Josh Sparkes>Do that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/841-0
03:12:34.619 --> 03:12:38.337
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't send emails with urgent agenda
and you know, get us done quickly.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/841-1
03:12:38.337 --> 03:12:41.510
<v Josh Sparkes>We we are the receiver.
So if kind of matrix is there that what</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/841-2
03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:44.088
<v Josh Sparkes>is the definition of P1?
What is the definition of?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/841-3
03:12:44.088 --> 03:12:48.153
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we need to be we need to be very
careful with that because obviously from</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/841-4
03:12:48.153 --> 03:12:50.880
<v Josh Sparkes>our P1P4 from like you take Matt's worlds
for example,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/841-5
03:12:50.880 --> 03:12:54.499
<v Josh Sparkes>that's a totally different thing than the
other report on that business.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/843-0
03:12:54.619 --> 03:12:57.744
<v Josh Sparkes>Impact and whatever else.
This isn't the vigilant impact,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/842-0
03:12:55.939 --> 03:12:56.219
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/843-1
03:12:57.744 --> 03:13:01.623
<v Josh Sparkes>so it's no, but P1 is just an example,
it's just terminology I'm using,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/843-2
03:13:01.623 --> 03:13:05.986
<v Josh Sparkes>but I'm saying that some sort of category
and a definition of it should be there</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/843-3
03:13:05.986 --> 03:13:08.734
<v Josh Sparkes>somewhere and that's what impacting it
could be a,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/843-4
03:13:08.734 --> 03:13:13.098
<v Josh Sparkes>you know you could have a like sometimes
we have service impacting you know it's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/843-5
03:13:13.098 --> 03:13:14.499
<v Josh Sparkes>something that's going to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/844-0
03:13:14.699 --> 03:13:18.583
<v Josh Sparkes>Break. You know,
if you're by not having this break so you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/844-1
03:13:18.583 --> 03:13:23.916
<v Josh Sparkes>could create that rather than, as you say,
I think we should take it as a. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/845-0
03:13:21.259 --> 03:13:26.354
<v Mark Sedge>But typically in in these situation in in
these situations you might want to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/844-2
03:13:23.916 --> 03:13:25.299
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah. The the danger.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/845-1
03:13:26.354 --> 03:13:30.985
<v Mark Sedge>consider reputational impact because
ultimately it's either you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/845-2
03:13:30.985 --> 03:13:35.220
<v Mark Sedge>revenue in reputation,
you know that sort of thing you could do</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/845-3
03:13:35.220 --> 03:13:37.139
<v Mark Sedge>that, but there's a tricky 1.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/848-0
03:13:37.459 --> 03:13:42.730
<v Mark Sedge>To get agreement right across the board
without fair bit of conversations and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/846-0
03:13:41.059 --> 03:13:41.339
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/848-1
03:13:42.730 --> 03:13:43.339
<v Mark Sedge>dialogue.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/850-0
03:13:44.219 --> 03:13:47.986
<v Josh Sparkes>The other piece I would say is if you use
that drop down list to say this is high</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/850-1
03:13:47.986 --> 03:13:51.201
<v Josh Sparkes>priority that will get abused.
So those are the element I would do it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/850-2
03:13:51.201 --> 03:13:53.544
<v Josh Sparkes>that way.
I've done here the way that you do it is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/850-3
03:13:53.544 --> 03:13:56.990
<v Josh Sparkes>you use certain business language.
So you might say is it impacted for the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/850-4
03:13:56.990 --> 03:14:00.619
<v Josh Sparkes>particular building date is it you know
something is it a general inquiry but.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/851-0
03:14:01.019 --> 03:14:04.178
<v Josh Sparkes>Behind the scenes,
when it comes through to the actual teams,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/851-1
03:14:04.178 --> 03:14:08.153
<v Josh Sparkes>there is a prioritisation so we can give
language to the user that they can't</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/851-2
03:14:08.153 --> 03:14:10.955
<v Josh Sparkes>distinguish or this is a really,
really high priority.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/851-3
03:14:10.955 --> 03:14:14.675
<v Josh Sparkes>It's going to be P1 on their list,
but it's enough for them to go OK no,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/851-4
03:14:14.675 --> 03:14:17.172
<v Josh Sparkes>this is this is quite serious. Yeah. Also.
Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/851-5
03:14:17.172 --> 03:14:20.739
<v Josh Sparkes>So we we should say that offline is a
design discussion and then say.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/852-0
03:14:20.899 --> 03:14:23.133
<v Josh Sparkes>Actually,
what the really key things for you or is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/852-1
03:14:23.133 --> 03:14:25.366
<v Josh Sparkes>it a VIP?
So we can then on proper priority views.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/852-2
03:14:25.366 --> 03:14:29.002
<v Josh Sparkes>Then you can imagine that queue as well.
But I'd say let's take that as a separate</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/852-3
03:14:29.002 --> 03:14:29.659
<v Josh Sparkes>piece for that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/853-0
03:14:33.939 --> 03:14:38.735
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's in the same place, same building.
And they didn't know that they were</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/853-1
03:14:38.735 --> 03:14:43.470
<v Josh Sparkes>ranked platinum to bonds. You know,
the feeling was that everyone was treated</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/853-2
03:14:43.470 --> 03:14:46.566
<v Josh Sparkes>equally.
And depending on what came in and who was</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/853-3
03:14:46.566 --> 03:14:49.783
<v Josh Sparkes>it for, it became a different,
a different priority.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/853-4
03:14:49.783 --> 03:14:52.819
<v Josh Sparkes>So all of that possible nature in the
background.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/854-0
03:14:53.619 --> 03:14:57.570
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm having the discussion now and you
may say general for phase one not right</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/854-1
03:14:57.570 --> 03:15:01.521
<v Josh Sparkes>now, but if we can evolve this and start,
you know, claims back to the business,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/854-2
03:15:01.521 --> 03:15:04.350
<v Josh Sparkes>let's let's think about the enhancement
of that later on.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/854-3
03:15:04.350 --> 03:15:08.203
<v Josh Sparkes>But it is a good way to kind of help you
prioritise across all of your finance</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/854-4
03:15:08.203 --> 03:15:11.179
<v Josh Sparkes>functions, not just within yeah, no,
absolutely and I think.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/855-0
03:15:11.739 --> 03:15:15.755
<v Josh Sparkes>It's it's a,
it's again a partial discussion with OPS</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/855-1
03:15:15.755 --> 03:15:19.473
<v Josh Sparkes>as well.
And then you can relay that message back</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/855-2
03:15:19.473 --> 03:15:24.679
<v Josh Sparkes>to the partners. It's it's,
it's difficult and we get urgent messages</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/855-3
03:15:24.679 --> 03:15:27.059
<v Josh Sparkes>or I mean emails back to urgent.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/856-0
03:15:27.819 --> 03:15:31.122
<v Josh Sparkes>And straight away we would get a teams
message within.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/856-1
03:15:31.122 --> 03:15:34.906
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm saying within like 2 minutes I'll
send an e-mail. So yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/856-2
03:15:34.906 --> 03:15:38.390
<v Josh Sparkes>we reply back here.
We're looking at it and then straight</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/856-3
03:15:38.390 --> 03:15:42.534
<v Josh Sparkes>away there will be a call. It's,
I would say it is 10 times worse in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/856-4
03:15:42.534 --> 03:15:46.558
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia. I mean over here,
I don't see that bad behaviour but in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/856-5
03:15:46.558 --> 03:15:46.979
<v Josh Sparkes>ounces.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/857-0
03:15:47.019 --> 03:15:50.928
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like 10 times worse. That's yeah.
It's it's, it is. And and I'm.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/857-1
03:15:50.928 --> 03:15:55.117
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm going couple of after a couple of
weeks and one of my key agenda is to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/857-2
03:15:55.117 --> 03:15:59.585
<v Josh Sparkes>define Slas for all my teams with the OPS
like what do you mean by one day four</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/857-3
03:15:59.585 --> 03:16:03.998
<v Josh Sparkes>hours like because we have those Slas and
we have been you know 80 percent 90%</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/857-4
03:16:03.998 --> 03:16:05.059
<v Josh Sparkes>hitting those Slas.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/859-0
03:16:05.339 --> 03:16:09.697
<v Josh Sparkes>So what does urgent mean for you?
So I mean, I'm gonna have that discussion,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/859-1
03:16:09.697 --> 03:16:13.545
<v Josh Sparkes>but I think from a service,
our perspective it would be interesting</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/859-2
03:16:13.545 --> 03:16:17.903
<v Josh Sparkes>to see if there is something which they
have an option to use and then there</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/859-3
03:16:17.903 --> 03:16:20.959
<v Josh Sparkes>there we see whether that is used or
misused as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/859-4
03:16:20.959 --> 03:16:23.619
<v Josh Sparkes>You know people that which think that you
can.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/858-0
03:16:22.739 --> 03:16:22.859
<v Parik>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/862-0
03:16:24.019 --> 03:16:26.800
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
they're there for this and there is the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/862-1
03:16:26.800 --> 03:16:30.739
<v Josh Sparkes>backbone of auto assignment,
also prioritisation SLA to come on the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/862-2
03:16:30.739 --> 03:16:33.578
<v Josh Sparkes>back of it.
That's there was a you know standard</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/862-3
03:16:33.578 --> 03:16:38.213
<v Josh Sparkes>functionalities just how we want to how
we want to structure that suggests that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/860-0
03:16:37.379 --> 03:16:37.859
<v Parik>I just.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/862-4
03:16:38.213 --> 03:16:41.689
<v Josh Sparkes>we we take it offline,
I'll come back to you with a what we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/861-0
03:16:40.379 --> 03:16:40.499
<v Parik>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/862-5
03:16:41.689 --> 03:16:43.659
<v Josh Sparkes>think that should not be a decent.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/863-0
03:16:44.059 --> 03:16:47.665
<v Josh Sparkes>It's kind of used as a kind of options as
a drop downs for the user or the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/863-1
03:16:47.665 --> 03:16:50.310
<v Josh Sparkes>operations teams and then you can have a
look at that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/863-2
03:16:50.310 --> 03:16:54.204
<v Josh Sparkes>So actually that I was thinking if you're
having discussions about Slas as well,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/863-3
03:16:54.204 --> 03:16:57.810
<v Josh Sparkes>that's a good way to kind of go, oh,
if it's particularly you know P1 that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/863-4
03:16:57.810 --> 03:17:01.801
<v Josh Sparkes>triggers a particular SLA which they then
get a response message that will respond</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/863-5
03:17:01.801 --> 03:17:02.619
<v Josh Sparkes>in four hours or.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/865-0
03:17:03.019 --> 03:17:07.333
<v Josh Sparkes>10 minutes or whichever is. Yeah,
we we can work through something as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/864-0
03:17:06.099 --> 03:17:06.419
<v Parik>Right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/865-1
03:17:07.333 --> 03:17:11.534
<v Josh Sparkes>We we do have a high priority class SLA.
Somebody back to it we we have a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/865-2
03:17:11.534 --> 03:17:14.656
<v Josh Sparkes>dedicated mark.
We have a dedicated SLA session in the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/865-3
03:17:14.656 --> 03:17:17.779
<v Josh Sparkes>calendar for a few weeks and we can use
that for this.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/867-0
03:17:16.379 --> 03:17:19.466
<v Parik>Just Josh, can I can you can,
can you hear me? Am I audible?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/867-1
03:17:19.466 --> 03:17:21.794
<v Parik>Just checking. Hi. Just on that point.
Right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/866-0
03:17:20.459 --> 03:17:21.059
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/867-2
03:17:21.794 --> 03:17:25.994
<v Parik>We can always explore the whole services
side of common service data model, right?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/867-3
03:17:25.994 --> 03:17:29.739
<v Parik>Because it's it's not just meant for IT.
It's meant for all the services.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/867-4
03:17:29.739 --> 03:17:32.219
<v Parik>And when you define services which are
critical.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/869-0
03:17:32.779 --> 03:17:36.611
<v Parik>You can put risk factors around it.
You can put service commitments around it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/869-1
03:17:36.611 --> 03:17:39.706
<v Parik>and that helps you decide in your process
how you tackle that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/869-2
03:17:39.706 --> 03:17:42.899
<v Parik>So we can take that off offline and
propose a model which works.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/870-0
03:17:45.059 --> 03:17:48.446
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. I mean, yeah, I,
although whatever I have said,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/870-1
03:17:48.446 --> 03:17:52.900
<v Josh Sparkes>I have doubts that will work,
to be honest with you because it's again</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/870-2
03:17:52.900 --> 03:17:57.353
<v Josh Sparkes>partner versus everybody else.
So if they want it, they want it right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/870-3
03:17:57.353 --> 03:18:02.121
<v Josh Sparkes>But I think somewhere right now currently
we don't have anything, any, any,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/870-4
03:18:02.121 --> 03:18:04.379
<v Josh Sparkes>any tools to even advise or go back.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/871-0
03:18:05.139 --> 03:18:07.527
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Because I mean, yes,
we do have Slas,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/871-1
03:18:07.527 --> 03:18:11.816
<v Josh Sparkes>but how many times we will generally
emailing back and saying this is not this</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/871-2
03:18:11.816 --> 03:18:14.910
<v Josh Sparkes>beer within our Slas,
don't mess it because we're tired.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/871-3
03:18:14.910 --> 03:18:19.090
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean we can't do that for a week.
So even having anything there would give</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/871-4
03:18:19.090 --> 03:18:23.270
<v Josh Sparkes>us some sort of you know confidence to
say hey by the way come down you know</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/871-5
03:18:23.270 --> 03:18:24.139
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll come back.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/872-0
03:18:24.739 --> 03:18:28.884
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's it's not with IT or anything.
I think internally we know internally I</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/872-1
03:18:28.884 --> 03:18:32.453
<v Josh Sparkes>TS SLAS are there they work back.
I think it is more with with with</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/872-2
03:18:32.453 --> 03:18:36.756
<v Josh Sparkes>operations and the front end queries you
know OK yeah I mean that's the way we'll</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/872-3
03:18:36.756 --> 03:18:39.852
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah exactly we can.
But certainly it's bad as you said we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/872-4
03:18:39.852 --> 03:18:41.059
<v Josh Sparkes>take a couple of month.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/873-0
03:18:41.899 --> 03:18:43.099
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Should we move on? Move along.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/874-0
03:18:45.619 --> 03:18:50.979
<v Josh Sparkes>Then address. Then. I'm sorry.
Do you have to call it QA? Check standard.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/874-1
03:18:50.979 --> 03:18:55.543
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, you covered. Yeah, I'm. I'm.
I think we covered. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/874-2
03:18:55.543 --> 03:19:01.339
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's just different reasons.
I'm saying having it the same. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/875-0
03:19:01.859 --> 03:19:03.859
<v Josh Sparkes>Issue. Yeah, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/877-0
03:19:06.739 --> 03:19:11.619
<v Josh Sparkes>Is he number comment is that the same you
know same queries of the.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/878-0
03:19:13.419 --> 03:19:13.739
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/879-0
03:19:17.299 --> 03:19:24.859
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, all these quick queries, OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/880-0
03:19:31.539 --> 03:19:32.019
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/881-0
03:19:33.699 --> 03:19:34.699
<v Josh Sparkes>That's actually.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/882-0
03:19:37.179 --> 03:19:42.449
<v Josh Sparkes>Don't really get that anymore.
I think previously what happened is that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/882-1
03:19:42.449 --> 03:19:44.499
<v Josh Sparkes>as part of the QE check and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/883-0
03:19:46.419 --> 03:19:51.922
<v Josh Sparkes>This should be a bat for certain
countries. There should be a bat number,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/883-1
03:19:51.922 --> 03:19:55.790
<v Josh Sparkes>and if there's a bat number,
it's part of the Asia,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/883-2
03:19:55.790 --> 03:20:00.847
<v Josh Sparkes>because if it isn't in there and it
should be there, we could send.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/883-3
03:20:00.847 --> 03:20:05.459
<v Josh Sparkes>We could also send an e-mail out to them
to to chase that up.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/884-0
03:20:05.539 --> 03:20:11.382
<v Josh Sparkes>But then they'll ever get back to us.
So we've actually paid the software. OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/884-1
03:20:11.382 --> 03:20:17.447
<v Josh Sparkes>so I but it's something as part of the
information, yeah, we have to set that up.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/884-2
03:20:17.447 --> 03:20:22.550
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah. OK. We are going to,
we've got an hour and I want to get</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/884-3
03:20:22.550 --> 03:20:25.139
<v Josh Sparkes>through rates and I think actually.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/885-0
03:20:25.339 --> 03:20:30.902
<v Josh Sparkes>Look again, having a look at it,
lots of them. Just create new and amends,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/885-1
03:20:30.902 --> 03:20:34.462
<v Josh Sparkes>so there is that,
and based on what we've done,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/885-2
03:20:34.462 --> 03:20:39.135
<v Josh Sparkes>create new and amends or of everything.
But now we're at rate,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/885-3
03:20:39.135 --> 03:20:40.619
<v Josh Sparkes>we're at rate level.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/886-0
03:20:42.299 --> 03:20:48.112
<v Josh Sparkes>All I see that there is a almost like one
service where you'll create amending and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/886-1
03:20:48.112 --> 03:20:53.856
<v Josh Sparkes>there's variations on it so you know that
we've discussed the mutually exclusive.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/886-2
03:20:53.856 --> 03:20:58.059
<v Josh Sparkes>It's probably even rolling up to a
combination of them, so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/887-0
03:20:59.019 --> 03:20:59.579
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm here.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/888-0
03:21:02.219 --> 03:21:05.101
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not one problem here,
slightly different so,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/888-1
03:21:05.101 --> 03:21:09.482
<v Josh Sparkes>but it just even spoke about this and
let's see everyone here on the board.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/888-2
03:21:09.482 --> 03:21:13.459
<v Josh Sparkes>You already can get everyone. Yeah, Mark,
you can still be here. No.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/889-0
03:21:16.939 --> 03:21:20.650
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I mean,
I mean the systems are recorded at least</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/889-1
03:21:20.650 --> 03:21:25.509
<v Josh Sparkes>then we can. So panel agreement,
this is where it's either a new client</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/889-2
03:21:25.509 --> 03:21:30.773
<v Josh Sparkes>and we've got brand new rates or else an
existing client and there's no rates</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/889-3
03:21:30.773 --> 03:21:34.079
<v Josh Sparkes>being initiated.
And do you have panels monthly,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/889-4
03:21:34.079 --> 03:21:35.699
<v Josh Sparkes>is that a regular thing?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/890-0
03:21:35.819 --> 03:21:41.464
<v Josh Sparkes>Or is it something you trigger based on
findings? No, no, we do have them regular.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/890-1
03:21:41.464 --> 03:21:44.457
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
we have regular panel agreements coming</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/890-2
03:21:44.457 --> 03:21:49.694
<v Josh Sparkes>through and basically they'll come
through and we've already discussed this.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/890-3
03:21:49.694 --> 03:21:51.939
<v Josh Sparkes>So they'll provide the dates and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/891-0
03:21:52.299 --> 03:21:56.640
<v Josh Sparkes>And maybe we'll discount the tell us or
don't tell us.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/891-1
03:21:56.640 --> 03:22:02.718
<v Josh Sparkes>We will create a rate cards and and so
that we understand what rates because</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/891-2
03:22:02.718 --> 03:22:07.139
<v Josh Sparkes>what might be senior associate,
we've got SAS 3 and S2.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/892-0
03:22:07.499 --> 03:22:11.254
<v Josh Sparkes>But if not actually really worded,
it's not the same word then,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/892-1
03:22:11.254 --> 03:22:14.598
<v Josh Sparkes>so we will put it on a rate card to what
we think it is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/892-2
03:22:14.598 --> 03:22:19.116
<v Josh Sparkes>We will send it back to standardised
terminology because that's how we would</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/892-3
03:22:19.116 --> 03:22:23.928
<v Josh Sparkes>put it into the E we can't put it in any
other way and then we would then send it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/892-4
03:22:23.928 --> 03:22:26.685
<v Josh Sparkes>back.
We would ask them to check that and once</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/892-5
03:22:26.685 --> 03:22:26.979
<v Josh Sparkes>they.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/893-0
03:22:27.139 --> 03:22:30.848
<v Josh Sparkes>But proof that we would then and put the
rates into. OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/893-1
03:22:30.848 --> 03:22:35.467
<v Josh Sparkes>so you're so that's not triggered,
that's something you do internally.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/893-2
03:22:35.467 --> 03:22:40.347
<v Josh Sparkes>So based on the of the of the request or
from the the actions on the panel</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/893-3
03:22:40.347 --> 03:22:45.227
<v Josh Sparkes>agreements. So the request, it is a,
it's a panel agreement request. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/893-4
03:22:45.227 --> 03:22:46.659
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a great question.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/894-0
03:22:46.819 --> 03:22:51.398
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's verbal or you're together or
anything come through via share will. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/894-1
03:22:51.398 --> 03:22:54.860
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. It could be OK. So,
and that can come in from whoever's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/894-2
03:22:54.860 --> 03:22:58.546
<v Josh Sparkes>partner quite often. OK.
Could be the global commercial team. OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/894-3
03:22:58.546 --> 03:23:02.511
<v Josh Sparkes>be senior account manager sometimes the
PE, but it's usually more. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/894-4
03:23:02.511 --> 03:23:06.699
<v Josh Sparkes>But I can come in as a request to you
that these are the following things.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/895-0
03:23:06.739 --> 03:23:10.816
<v Josh Sparkes>That need to be. Yeah,
that's up will change so very much how we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/895-1
03:23:10.816 --> 03:23:14.892
<v Josh Sparkes>discussed earlier. Yeah,
on for these ones 50 at a rate card and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/895-2
03:23:14.892 --> 03:23:18.718
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a lot more,
it could be 27 locations that were input</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/895-3
03:23:18.718 --> 03:23:21.603
<v Josh Sparkes>in.
So our 7th level for that one is 2 weeks.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/895-4
03:23:21.603 --> 03:23:22.419
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, OK, cool.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/896-0
03:23:25.019 --> 03:23:29.860
<v Josh Sparkes>And then what input they upfront give you
rather than just to request they you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/896-1
03:23:29.860 --> 03:23:33.659
<v Josh Sparkes>could trigger there's a down the
checklist that they need to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/897-0
03:23:35.659 --> 03:23:38.216
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
could it be that you want the rates,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/897-1
03:23:38.216 --> 03:23:42.478
<v Josh Sparkes>so you could say you want the rates for
who or what's it for and then I've</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/897-2
03:23:42.478 --> 03:23:45.148
<v Josh Sparkes>actually we've actually got a rate card.
Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/897-3
03:23:45.148 --> 03:23:49.580
<v Josh Sparkes>that standardised rate card that we were
already getting some people to start</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/897-4
03:23:49.580 --> 03:23:53.672
<v Josh Sparkes>using it but not partner level.
We've started to ask in like the global</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/897-5
03:23:53.672 --> 03:23:54.979
<v Josh Sparkes>commercial team to use.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/898-0
03:23:55.379 --> 03:23:59.594
<v Josh Sparkes>So that the input rates and that means
we've got them on the rate card and we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/898-1
03:23:59.594 --> 03:24:02.567
<v Josh Sparkes>can then start and put them.
I wonder if that's right,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/898-2
03:24:02.567 --> 03:24:05.917
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe we can investigate potentially
essentially asking them,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/898-3
03:24:05.917 --> 03:24:10.457
<v Josh Sparkes>but how they want to go live by different,
how we go live by September that they're</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/898-4
03:24:10.457 --> 03:24:14.619
<v Josh Sparkes>indoctorating that's you know between now
and then of using these right now.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/899-0
03:24:14.939 --> 03:24:15.219
<v Josh Sparkes>Good.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/900-0
03:24:15.419 --> 03:24:18.966
<v Josh Sparkes>It might be an option here,
but they used to using them for that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/900-1
03:24:18.966 --> 03:24:21.477
<v Josh Sparkes>adoption.
When we go live it quite often it's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/900-2
03:24:21.477 --> 03:24:25.733
<v Josh Sparkes>either the panel agreement or they just
send an attachment or the snip of the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/900-3
03:24:25.733 --> 03:24:28.244
<v Josh Sparkes>rate shop and and then we need to come
there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/900-4
03:24:28.244 --> 03:24:32.774
<v Josh Sparkes>You can formalise that essentially based
on that standard and then so we would say</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/900-5
03:24:32.774 --> 03:24:35.339
<v Josh Sparkes>for them get them on the rate card,
send them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/901-0
03:24:35.419 --> 03:24:38.875
<v Josh Sparkes>They're back to be approved when we get
them back,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/901-1
03:24:38.875 --> 03:24:44.228
<v Josh Sparkes>then we input the rates into 3 E and we
need the effective date and when these</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/901-2
03:24:44.228 --> 03:24:49.649
<v Josh Sparkes>are from and all those effective date
rules is that can be in the past or is it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/901-3
03:24:49.649 --> 03:24:50.259
<v Josh Sparkes>from now?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/902-0
03:24:50.979 --> 03:24:54.403
<v Josh Sparkes>No people, they'll tell us.
It's usually in the past. All.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/902-1
03:24:54.403 --> 03:24:58.291
<v Josh Sparkes>For example, we've got one.
I know that's coming up now that's due</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/902-2
03:24:58.291 --> 03:25:01.483
<v Josh Sparkes>the 1st of November and we still don't
have the reach.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/902-3
03:25:01.483 --> 03:25:04.501
<v Josh Sparkes>So that yet we may get that the middle of
November.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/902-4
03:25:04.501 --> 03:25:07.519
<v Josh Sparkes>So we will we'll put the first stop there
you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/902-5
03:25:07.519 --> 03:25:09.899
<v Josh Sparkes>so yeah OK and pre approval so the panel.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/903-0
03:25:10.339 --> 03:25:14.149
<v Josh Sparkes>And with the fact that you they've had
the panel agreements,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/903-1
03:25:14.149 --> 03:25:17.086
<v Josh Sparkes>we don't need approval details, OK,
that's OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/903-2
03:25:17.086 --> 03:25:21.833
<v Josh Sparkes>And obviously we would need to quite
important actually we need to have the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/903-3
03:25:21.833 --> 03:25:26.019
<v Josh Sparkes>client numbers that this applies to.
So that could be part of the.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/904-0
03:25:26.619 --> 03:25:30.098
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.
Because you're having sneak them anyway.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/904-1
03:25:30.098 --> 03:25:32.789
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
And it's something that they could</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/904-2
03:25:32.789 --> 03:25:37.385
<v Josh Sparkes>provide. Yeah. Or will you have?
Otherwise, they don't stay a client,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/904-3
03:25:37.385 --> 03:25:40.339
<v Josh Sparkes>but when you get that client,
that could be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/905-0
03:25:41.459 --> 03:25:45.048
<v Josh Sparkes>120 client numbers and so there's cheques
that has to be done.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/905-1
03:25:45.048 --> 03:25:47.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe we can talk about the requirements
of that,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/905-2
03:25:47.897 --> 03:25:50.404
<v Josh Sparkes>but we do need the effective date.
Ideally,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/905-3
03:25:50.404 --> 03:25:55.134
<v Josh Sparkes>ideally we'd like them to create the date
cards and then we also what we're trying</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/905-4
03:25:55.134 --> 03:25:57.299
<v Josh Sparkes>to do now is actually check with them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/906-0
03:25:57.699 --> 03:26:02.822
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's just kind of new at the moment,
which client numbers should that be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/906-1
03:26:02.822 --> 03:26:07.232
<v Josh Sparkes>important to that don't always know
whether you've got. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/906-2
03:26:07.232 --> 03:26:12.355
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's just not improved on that.
And then you'll see that created in three</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/906-3
03:26:12.355 --> 03:26:12.939
<v Josh Sparkes>E, right?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/907-0
03:26:13.419 --> 03:26:19.211
<v Josh Sparkes>And then those complete and then the
requester gets notified. Yeah, yeah. OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/907-1
03:26:19.211 --> 03:26:23.221
<v Josh Sparkes>no, they put example.
That rate card for some reason,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/907-2
03:26:23.221 --> 03:26:27.751
<v Josh Sparkes>one of them at whichever level is
thresholds that you think,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/907-3
03:26:27.751 --> 03:26:31.539
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm imagine that they are hierarchical
structures.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/908-0
03:26:32.179 --> 03:26:36.085
<v Josh Sparkes>And then suddenly one of them is
unusually high or outside of that bands</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/908-1
03:26:36.085 --> 03:26:40.152
<v Josh Sparkes>you maybe have thresholds within those
ways that they put in that you think</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/908-2
03:26:40.152 --> 03:26:43.096
<v Josh Sparkes>that's, I would question it. OK.
And I have done that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/908-3
03:26:43.096 --> 03:26:47.163
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm going to go back. So for example,
one that I've done quite recently,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/908-4
03:26:47.163 --> 03:26:51.177
<v Josh Sparkes>there was I think was the 22 vacations
with something and you had the rate</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/908-5
03:26:51.177 --> 03:26:51.819
<v Josh Sparkes>classes and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/909-0
03:26:51.899 --> 03:26:55.415
<v Josh Sparkes>One of them there was a reclass higher
than another one. Yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/909-1
03:26:55.415 --> 03:26:59.328
<v Josh Sparkes>So I questioned that. I mean.
And they'll come back and tell me. Ah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/909-2
03:26:59.328 --> 03:27:02.107
<v Josh Sparkes>Ashley.
So maybe that's validation because we've</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/909-3
03:27:02.107 --> 03:27:05.283
<v Josh Sparkes>got that matrix,
or we can that incorrect numbers can't</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/909-4
03:27:05.283 --> 03:27:08.743
<v Josh Sparkes>you know those thresholds because you
know your bands? Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/909-5
03:27:08.743 --> 03:27:11.579
<v Josh Sparkes>but it can't be entered incorrectly.
It's almost.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/910-0
03:27:11.619 --> 03:27:14.525
<v Josh Sparkes>Lower than the standardised rate anyway.
OK, yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/910-1
03:27:14.525 --> 03:27:18.400
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be in the background standards,
right for X that we. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/910-2
03:27:18.400 --> 03:27:22.048
<v Josh Sparkes>Can integration or managed.
I'm not sure how often they change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/910-3
03:27:22.048 --> 03:27:26.151
<v Josh Sparkes>Are they an annual reviews of them
somewhere annual somewhere every few</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/910-4
03:27:26.151 --> 03:27:29.000
<v Josh Sparkes>years. OK.
So that's the thing we can have in the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/910-5
03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:30.539
<v Josh Sparkes>background, but it's never.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/911-0
03:27:31.139 --> 03:27:35.062
<v Josh Sparkes>And you avoid that back and forth and it
can never be higher than the standard,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/911-1
03:27:35.062 --> 03:27:38.446
<v Josh Sparkes>given the sound of great.
So they can't enter it incorrectly anyway,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/911-2
03:27:38.446 --> 03:27:40.801
<v Josh Sparkes>and it could be that it's a drop that you
know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/911-3
03:27:40.801 --> 03:27:44.037
<v Josh Sparkes>although they're not finding the drop
down, it's a bit, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/911-4
03:27:44.037 --> 03:27:46.539
<v Josh Sparkes>sometimes on some forms when you're
entering your.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/912-0
03:27:47.339 --> 03:27:51.670
<v Josh Sparkes>The only thing that I'll say about that
is this different standard rates as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/912-1
03:27:51.670 --> 03:27:55.261
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not straightforward.
You've got global standard rates and then</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/912-2
03:27:55.261 --> 03:27:57.691
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got local.
It's not just one big card.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/912-3
03:27:57.691 --> 03:28:00.543
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got local rates as well,
yes and yes. So yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/912-4
03:28:00.543 --> 03:28:04.663
<v Josh Sparkes>depending on the location and that will
be, yeah. So I can answer that value.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/912-5
03:28:04.663 --> 03:28:06.459
<v Josh Sparkes>But within within the range, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/913-0
03:28:06.659 --> 03:28:09.716
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's good.
And then you'll see that do it and you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/913-1
03:28:09.716 --> 03:28:13.647
<v Josh Sparkes>can confirm that's been entered.
And then the question will get the yes</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/913-2
03:28:13.647 --> 03:28:17.906
<v Josh Sparkes>and you do need any number associated
with that that you enter that they need</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/913-3
03:28:17.906 --> 03:28:21.127
<v Josh Sparkes>to know. No, no,
no referencing or no and and we we advise</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/913-4
03:28:21.127 --> 03:28:22.219
<v Josh Sparkes>from that it's been.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/914-0
03:28:22.859 --> 03:28:26.681
<v Josh Sparkes>Completed then in what we do is we recipe
then three EBG calculate.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/914-1
03:28:26.681 --> 03:28:31.010
<v Josh Sparkes>So we see completed and all rates are
recalculated so that the know that the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/914-2
03:28:31.010 --> 03:28:35.732
<v Josh Sparkes>new rates have been updated so so as part
of that notification it could be done and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/914-3
03:28:35.732 --> 03:28:38.486
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah right.
You know again there's probably that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/914-4
03:28:38.486 --> 03:28:41.859
<v Josh Sparkes>template that we're talking about as part
of the messaging.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/915-0
03:28:42.379 --> 03:28:46.452
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not that it's just done,
but new rates have been recalculated and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/915-1
03:28:46.452 --> 03:28:50.928
<v Josh Sparkes>I would be keen on this one and to be
really involved in the response to that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/915-2
03:28:50.928 --> 03:28:55.633
<v Josh Sparkes>because quite a lot that we need to make
them aware of that we've we've done what</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/915-3
03:28:55.633 --> 03:28:59.821
<v Josh Sparkes>we do or responsible for. However,
as well there's all downstream. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/915-4
03:28:59.821 --> 03:29:02.059
<v Josh Sparkes>you know impact of that so for example.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/916-0
03:29:02.139 --> 03:29:06.608
<v Josh Sparkes>So if there's a re matter level,
even though we've applied it at client</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/916-1
03:29:06.608 --> 03:29:09.650
<v Josh Sparkes>level,
it's not going to come through and that's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/916-2
03:29:09.650 --> 03:29:14.243
<v Josh Sparkes>not our responsibilities, you know.
So we need to make them aware of it's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/916-3
03:29:14.243 --> 03:29:17.099
<v Josh Sparkes>been done. What we've done is, however,
yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/918-0
03:29:17.779 --> 03:29:22.678
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. OK. And what next? Yeah. Yeah.
What's the scenario term?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/918-1
03:29:22.678 --> 03:29:28.199
<v Josh Sparkes>What's next or whatever happens? So that.
Yeah. OK. That's a good one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/918-2
03:29:28.199 --> 03:29:34.108
<v Josh Sparkes>Anything that means that you're then not
informed of what's next, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/918-3
03:29:34.108 --> 03:29:37.219
<v Josh Sparkes>any information that you're giving them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/919-0
03:29:37.299 --> 03:29:42.237
<v Josh Sparkes>Insights to aids that experience for them
as well. Yeah, that's good. I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/919-1
03:29:42.237 --> 03:29:47.302
<v Josh Sparkes>we probably don't want to get into what's
next for because it might be, I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/919-2
03:29:47.302 --> 03:29:50.848
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, no, no.
Maybe just touch on what team then we use</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/919-3
03:29:50.848 --> 03:29:55.089
<v Josh Sparkes>to get involved. What is next?
I know it's it's more about this is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/919-4
03:29:55.089 --> 03:29:57.179
<v Josh Sparkes>what's done and it's making them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/920-0
03:29:57.259 --> 03:30:02.245
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm aware that some still not may be
correct that that's up to the PE to check</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/920-1
03:30:02.245 --> 03:30:06.348
<v Josh Sparkes>the particular matters.
OK that may be because a layout of roles</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/920-2
03:30:06.348 --> 03:30:10.766
<v Josh Sparkes>and what they have to do next.
I just thought if you said it actually</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/920-3
03:30:10.766 --> 03:30:14.679
<v Josh Sparkes>then goes to a different team we could,
you know include. No,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/920-4
03:30:14.679 --> 03:30:16.699
<v Josh Sparkes>it's more for PE responsibility.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/921-0
03:30:16.899 --> 03:30:21.835
<v Josh Sparkes>Is we will update the rates and then
they'll come back and say this matters</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/921-1
03:30:21.835 --> 03:30:25.212
<v Josh Sparkes>incorrect,
but that's because you're asked for that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/921-2
03:30:25.212 --> 03:30:30.083
<v Josh Sparkes>specific matter to have overwrites
anything else we do sort of thing, yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/921-3
03:30:30.083 --> 03:30:34.110
<v Josh Sparkes>anything that stops that we quickly we
can do OK. I mean, OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/921-4
03:30:34.110 --> 03:30:36.059
<v Josh Sparkes>so we've got a lot of stories.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/922-0
03:30:37.019 --> 03:30:40.777
<v Josh Sparkes>They're probably very much so great. New.
Yeah. Amends. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/922-1
03:30:40.777 --> 03:30:44.293
<v Josh Sparkes>So this one is it's not a panel agreement.
Next one down.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/922-2
03:30:44.293 --> 03:30:49.143
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's literally they just they give us
rates that they want to change for PES</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/922-3
03:30:49.143 --> 03:30:53.751
<v Josh Sparkes>again anybody generally PES yeah but
anybody but generally PES they want to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/922-4
03:30:53.751 --> 03:30:54.539
<v Josh Sparkes>change leads.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/923-0
03:30:55.099 --> 03:30:58.835
<v Josh Sparkes>And and actually,
we'll just go into 3E change rates.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/923-1
03:30:58.835 --> 03:31:03.333
<v Josh Sparkes>We need the effective date from again
approval pre approval. No,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/923-2
03:31:03.333 --> 03:31:06.585
<v Josh Sparkes>we don't need approval details.
We trust them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/923-3
03:31:06.585 --> 03:31:12.052
<v Josh Sparkes>They just need to agree that formalise
that they sort of taking something that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/923-4
03:31:12.052 --> 03:31:14.059
<v Josh Sparkes>approval yeah. Yeah and then.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/924-0
03:31:14.419 --> 03:31:17.270
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
we've got 3 E we'll update the rates,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/924-1
03:31:17.270 --> 03:31:20.186
<v Josh Sparkes>no effective date and recalculate the
rates.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/924-2
03:31:20.186 --> 03:31:24.268
<v Josh Sparkes>And then just advise them that that's
been done. OK, yeah. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/924-3
03:31:24.268 --> 03:31:27.120
<v Josh Sparkes>And on any of these though,
FY is you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/924-4
03:31:27.120 --> 03:31:30.619
<v Josh Sparkes>take notification of what they need to do.
It's just.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/925-0
03:31:30.819 --> 03:31:34.309
<v Josh Sparkes>It's been closed. Complete. Yeah.
That's it. Yeah. So that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/925-1
03:31:34.309 --> 03:31:38.439
<v Josh Sparkes>And is that the general way?
So that's create new or amend is it comes</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/925-2
03:31:38.439 --> 03:31:43.209
<v Josh Sparkes>in the same yet or do the men need? No,
no. I thought it's the same. Kinda. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/925-3
03:31:43.209 --> 03:31:47.339
<v Josh Sparkes>You're either adding it, creating it,
sorry, or you're amending it or.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/926-0
03:31:47.739 --> 03:31:50.573
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
the lending can be on a threshold that's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/926-1
03:31:50.573 --> 03:31:55.459
<v Josh Sparkes>higher or greater than you know within
the bands or it could be that there's not</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/926-2
03:31:55.459 --> 03:31:58.354
<v Josh Sparkes>been negotiated rates for certain rate
classes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/926-3
03:31:58.354 --> 03:32:01.189
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're pulling through its standard
rates.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/926-4
03:32:01.189 --> 03:32:05.953
<v Josh Sparkes>So the one that's to go in and amend them
to the same sort of principle. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/926-5
03:32:05.953 --> 03:32:06.979
<v Josh Sparkes>exactly the same.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/927-0
03:32:07.339 --> 03:32:11.478
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. And there's lots of those.
So we have the sort of standard of HD to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/927-1
03:32:11.478 --> 03:32:16.250
<v Josh Sparkes>client rights make will be different and
like all the all the rate queries will be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/927-2
03:32:16.250 --> 03:32:19.700
<v Josh Sparkes>OK and it's they'll be all the rate
queries come under one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/927-3
03:32:19.700 --> 03:32:23.034
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's the one on slingshopping,
OK could be anything,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/927-4
03:32:23.034 --> 03:32:27.059
<v Josh Sparkes>but they will return to the query ones.
But the other ones which are.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/928-0
03:32:27.299 --> 03:32:32.045
<v Josh Sparkes>Create new matter rates. Yeah,
they're similar all and I think you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/928-1
03:32:32.045 --> 03:32:37.146
<v Josh Sparkes>touched up on the new pro forma
adjustment that you need to might be as</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/928-2
03:32:37.146 --> 03:32:41.963
<v Josh Sparkes>do on the back of the other tasks that
need to be done. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/928-3
03:32:41.963 --> 03:32:44.939
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the same thing. They're asking us to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/929-0
03:32:46.379 --> 03:32:50.825
<v Josh Sparkes>Add new rates or at the discount which is
your performer. Yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/929-1
03:32:50.825 --> 03:32:55.272
<v Josh Sparkes>and that's just this pending Rick,
we discussed where it goes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/929-2
03:32:55.272 --> 03:32:58.448
<v Josh Sparkes>That's where we need to move back here.
Yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/929-3
03:32:58.448 --> 03:33:02.259
<v Josh Sparkes>I that's the same of the work for that
already, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/930-0
03:33:02.939 --> 03:33:07.721
<v Josh Sparkes>Learning and then you've got issue and I
don't want another one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/930-1
03:33:07.721 --> 03:33:13.754
<v Josh Sparkes>And then you've got the rates out with oh
actually maybe out with panel agreement</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/930-2
03:33:13.754 --> 03:33:19.419
<v Josh Sparkes>it was just a couple is that very much
same. Here's another variation of it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/931-0
03:33:20.739 --> 03:33:25.795
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. And yeah, they're all the same, OK.
And then pro forma, that's yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/931-1
03:33:25.795 --> 03:33:30.922
<v Josh Sparkes>that's applying a discount. Yeah,
because I'm losing to them, not going.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/931-2
03:33:30.922 --> 03:33:36.751
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can do concentrate and query next
one down plus. OK. So then standard rates,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/931-3
03:33:36.751 --> 03:33:39.139
<v Josh Sparkes>that's a query that we'll come to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/932-0
03:33:39.499 --> 03:33:44.528
<v Josh Sparkes>And we discussed the QA withholding taxes
that, as you said that tax. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/932-1
03:33:44.528 --> 03:33:48.233
<v Josh Sparkes>that again, that's wrong here. Yeah.
Security ones. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/932-2
03:33:48.233 --> 03:33:52.865
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have landed on queries. Yeah.
So these are kind of what I would</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/932-3
03:33:52.865 --> 03:33:57.299
<v Josh Sparkes>probably call the free form free text
stuff. It could be anything.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/933-0
03:33:57.619 --> 03:34:02.059
<v Josh Sparkes>Really a query so it could be they're
just asking what the queries are.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/933-1
03:34:02.059 --> 03:34:07.116
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry what the rates are for that client
and they just want us to send them easy.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/933-2
03:34:07.116 --> 03:34:10.385
<v Josh Sparkes>They can't do,
they've not got that information. So.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/933-3
03:34:10.385 --> 03:34:14.825
<v Josh Sparkes>So we will check if we've got any
engagement letters or any information</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/933-4
03:34:14.825 --> 03:34:16.059
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll then check it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/934-0
03:34:16.899 --> 03:34:20.841
<v Josh Sparkes>3E and if we have to,
we'll export rules coming rates or we'll</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/934-1
03:34:20.841 --> 03:34:25.910
<v Josh Sparkes>have a look through and we'll just check
and see see what's what they might want</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/934-2
03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:29.916
<v Josh Sparkes>information on, you know,
when's the panel agreement to finish?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/934-3
03:34:29.916 --> 03:34:32.419
<v Josh Sparkes>These can be quite long queries because.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/935-0
03:34:33.379 --> 03:34:37.735
<v Josh Sparkes>It might not be reached at client level
and then we have to start going and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/935-1
03:34:37.735 --> 03:34:42.320
<v Josh Sparkes>investigating every single matter to give
them an idea and then we have to see,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/935-2
03:34:42.320 --> 03:34:45.702
<v Josh Sparkes>right, you know these matters here.
I've got 15% discount.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/935-3
03:34:45.702 --> 03:34:49.141
<v Josh Sparkes>These ones are standard.
All they can be general. Yes, yes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/935-4
03:34:49.141 --> 03:34:52.179
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're they're very much it could the
the query.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/936-0
03:34:52.259 --> 03:34:56.806
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be anything really. You know,
and I wonder if that's captured.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/936-1
03:34:56.806 --> 03:35:01.796
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got a general query that we're
having a discussion on whether that comes</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/936-2
03:35:01.796 --> 03:35:05.459
<v Josh Sparkes>under any anything.
So it could be related to the client.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/936-3
03:35:05.459 --> 03:35:09.753
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the same type thing.
It could be related to the matter when it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/936-4
03:35:09.753 --> 03:35:11.459
<v Josh Sparkes>says standard rate query I.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/937-0
03:35:12.099 --> 03:35:16.440
<v Josh Sparkes>They would kind of clump them together.
Of course you're investigating. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/937-1
03:35:16.440 --> 03:35:20.837
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. It's something to. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, it could be that, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/937-2
03:35:20.837 --> 03:35:24.733
<v Josh Sparkes>a general query within briefly.
Sort of you on that form that you're.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/937-3
03:35:24.733 --> 03:35:29.019
<v Josh Sparkes>It's leading them. Yeah. That also.
And then it lands with the right person.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/938-0
03:35:29.979 --> 03:35:34.415
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, I mean,
how many views do you get a month? A lot.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/938-1
03:35:34.415 --> 03:35:38.927
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, I would say to prepare,
they can be quite complex.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/938-2
03:35:38.927 --> 03:35:43.287
<v Josh Sparkes>I tend to take them.
So I could be doing the complex one</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/938-3
03:35:43.287 --> 03:35:46.499
<v Josh Sparkes>should, which can sometimes take a day or.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/939-0
03:35:47.579 --> 03:35:53.081
<v Josh Sparkes>And and that could be 20 months maybe and
for the complex ones, the other ones,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/939-1
03:35:53.081 --> 03:35:56.932
<v Josh Sparkes>it's easy enough.
It's just what are the rates for this</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/939-2
03:35:56.932 --> 03:36:01.059
<v Josh Sparkes>client and what should the rates be?
Are they getting this?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/941-0
03:36:02.219 --> 03:36:05.137
<v Mark Sedge>If, if,
if we're if we're smart and we may be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/940-0
03:36:03.259 --> 03:36:03.579
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/941-1
03:36:05.137 --> 03:36:09.134
<v Mark Sedge>categorised, get some categories on there,
some of those ones.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/941-2
03:36:09.134 --> 03:36:14.209
<v Mark Sedge>So you know is your query related to pick
list various options depending on the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/941-3
03:36:14.209 --> 03:36:18.967
<v Mark Sedge>options you're routing to different
members of the team or if nothing else</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/941-4
03:36:18.967 --> 03:36:22.139
<v Mark Sedge>it'll give you a better breakdown of what
you're.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/944-0
03:36:22.179 --> 03:36:25.887
<v Mark Sedge>Likely to you know,
the the workload involved perhaps,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/942-0
03:36:23.899 --> 03:36:24.379
<v Josh Sparkes>Buckingham.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/944-1
03:36:25.887 --> 03:36:28.179
<v Mark Sedge>is that something that would work?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/943-0
03:36:26.539 --> 03:36:26.939
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/947-0
03:36:28.699 --> 03:36:31.870
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I think I mean because we categorise them,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/947-1
03:36:31.870 --> 03:36:35.948
<v Josh Sparkes>but obviously the the Questor doesn't at
the moment. But yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/946-0
03:36:35.179 --> 03:36:37.807
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
I think it's like we we we we have the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/947-2
03:36:35.948 --> 03:36:39.379
<v Josh Sparkes>we could be looking at some. Yeah,
good point, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/946-1
03:36:37.807 --> 03:36:38.099
<v Mark Sedge>same.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/949-0
03:36:39.979 --> 03:36:42.583
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
we have the same sort of principle with</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/949-1
03:36:42.583 --> 03:36:46.715
<v Mark Sedge>the with like IT or any of the others.
If you can sort of steer what it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/949-2
03:36:46.715 --> 03:36:51.243
<v Mark Sedge>what help would you are you looking for
what sort of topic you know and sort of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/948-0
03:36:49.779 --> 03:36:50.139
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/949-3
03:36:51.243 --> 03:36:54.470
<v Mark Sedge>help them even,
I mean they will still pick probably the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/949-4
03:36:54.470 --> 03:36:55.659
<v Mark Sedge>wrong topic at times.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/951-0
03:36:56.139 --> 03:37:00.271
<v Mark Sedge>But it just means that sort of 80% might
come through a little bit easier.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/951-1
03:37:00.271 --> 03:37:03.246
<v Mark Sedge>And then if you see that coming through
consistently,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/951-2
03:37:03.246 --> 03:37:07.709
<v Mark Sedge>you can then maybe route if it's light
touch to another colleague or you know at</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/950-0
03:37:07.699 --> 03:37:08.299
<v Josh Sparkes>Mm-hmm.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/951-3
03:37:07.709 --> 03:37:10.739
<v Mark Sedge>least it enables you to prioritise what
you deal with.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/952-0
03:37:11.739 --> 03:37:15.306
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah. So for example,
if it's just they just got in with the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/952-1
03:37:15.306 --> 03:37:18.607
<v Josh Sparkes>rates for the client, that's simple.
But at the minute, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/952-2
03:37:18.607 --> 03:37:22.919
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's and that's quite appears Mark
said that it could be a quick that's an</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/952-3
03:37:22.919 --> 03:37:26.274
<v Josh Sparkes>easy pick list, yeah,
you know and you could do the pick list,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/952-4
03:37:26.274 --> 03:37:27.179
<v Josh Sparkes>so they actually.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/953-0
03:37:27.499 --> 03:37:30.041
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
the top one is you can always find in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/953-1
03:37:30.041 --> 03:37:33.114
<v Josh Sparkes>some of these pick lists.
They always pick the first one,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/953-2
03:37:33.114 --> 03:37:36.027
<v Josh Sparkes>but you know,
leave them into not too many and you can</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/953-3
03:37:36.027 --> 03:37:39.046
<v Josh Sparkes>at least as much.
So built at 80% and the other ones you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/953-4
03:37:39.046 --> 03:37:42.648
<v Josh Sparkes>could categorise yourself.
We're trying to we're trying to do it in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/953-5
03:37:42.648 --> 03:37:46.939
<v Josh Sparkes>smart ways so that we can try and answer
their questions with knowledge if they.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/954-0
03:37:47.139 --> 03:37:51.235
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, search for certain thing. Yeah.
Yeah, some of them you might. You know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/954-1
03:37:51.235 --> 03:37:54.386
<v Josh Sparkes>it's late. It's stopped there.
But you don't get the query.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/954-2
03:37:54.386 --> 03:37:57.905
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe there's an only chance to call that
answers. Yeah. Question.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/954-3
03:37:57.905 --> 03:38:01.476
<v Josh Sparkes>So it stops that at the past,
no doubt that they'll ask you anyway.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/954-4
03:38:01.476 --> 03:38:01.739
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/955-0
03:38:02.939 --> 03:38:06.685
<v Josh Sparkes>But and then as you say,
and then we could be able to assign to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/955-1
03:38:06.685 --> 03:38:09.496
<v Josh Sparkes>based on those pick lists or it might
just say,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/955-2
03:38:09.496 --> 03:38:14.179
<v Josh Sparkes>well actually in the first instance I
want them to be all assigned to yourself,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/955-3
03:38:14.179 --> 03:38:18.394
<v Josh Sparkes>you're going to group and you can,
you know, reassign if you needed to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/955-4
03:38:18.394 --> 03:38:20.619
<v Josh Sparkes>But the key thing as you said is that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/957-0
03:38:21.179 --> 03:38:25.408
<v Josh Sparkes>When they're raised by the requester,
when you've moved it into work in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/957-1
03:38:25.408 --> 03:38:29.578
<v Josh Sparkes>progress, that's metric bound,
and then when you closed it so it could</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/957-2
03:38:29.578 --> 03:38:34.218
<v Josh Sparkes>be at the end of your dashboard, you know,
say, look justification of my time,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/957-3
03:38:34.218 --> 03:38:36.979
<v Josh Sparkes>I had to work on all of this, you know,
stuff.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/956-0
03:38:36.699 --> 03:38:36.819
<v Mark Sedge>Yep.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/959-0
03:38:37.219 --> 03:38:40.884
<v Josh Sparkes>In their close completes and you know,
so at least you get.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/959-1
03:38:40.884 --> 03:38:45.526
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got a breakdown of everyone of
what you're working on versus queries</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/958-0
03:38:44.579 --> 03:38:44.699
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/959-2
03:38:45.526 --> 03:38:49.191
<v Josh Sparkes>versus updates versus changes versus new.
That's all there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/959-3
03:38:49.191 --> 03:38:50.779
<v Josh Sparkes>And we're going to report.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/960-0
03:38:51.339 --> 03:38:54.524
<v Mark Sedge>In addition,
just put thinking back what you could do</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/960-1
03:38:54.524 --> 03:38:59.301
<v Mark Sedge>is depending on what they they select.
If you've got defined knowledge articles,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/960-2
03:38:59.301 --> 03:39:02.487
<v Mark Sedge>even if they're not,
they don't cover everything. So.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/960-3
03:39:02.487 --> 03:39:06.969
<v Mark Sedge>So I collected a rate query and there
were three or four knowledge articles</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/960-4
03:39:06.969 --> 03:39:08.739
<v Mark Sedge>that you had related to rates.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/961-0
03:39:09.139 --> 03:39:13.496
<v Mark Sedge>You could again get present those on the
screen to enable the audience to just</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/961-1
03:39:13.496 --> 03:39:17.964
<v Mark Sedge>have a quick look down and maybe they can
then just read if they can see a title</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/961-2
03:39:17.964 --> 03:39:22.101
<v Mark Sedge>said oh, that's my query. Again,
it's about trying to help them and prompt</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/961-3
03:39:22.101 --> 03:39:24.803
<v Mark Sedge>them that,
you know point at which they start to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/961-4
03:39:24.803 --> 03:39:28.499
<v Mark Sedge>raise because it might be they see the
the knowledge article that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/963-0
03:39:28.699 --> 03:39:32.474
<v Mark Sedge>Perhaps helps them with that guidance.
Then they don't have to submit the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/963-1
03:39:32.474 --> 03:39:35.229
<v Mark Sedge>request at all,
but we use the request to present the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/963-2
03:39:35.229 --> 03:39:35.739
<v Mark Sedge>knowledge.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/964-0
03:39:36.699 --> 03:39:39.677
<v Josh Sparkes>I suppose in this case is the fact that
they can't go to,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/964-1
03:39:39.677 --> 03:39:43.426
<v Josh Sparkes>even though they can't actually access
the data. It's not like there is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/964-2
03:39:43.426 --> 03:39:47.174
<v Josh Sparkes>They want the information because they
can't do it themselves or see it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/964-3
03:39:47.174 --> 03:39:49.485
<v Josh Sparkes>But I mean,
I don't know if that would work,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/964-4
03:39:49.485 --> 03:39:53.439
<v Josh Sparkes>but what you just said that has made me
think because we've got the standard</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/964-5
03:39:53.439 --> 03:39:55.699
<v Josh Sparkes>rates and quite often that's what we
asked.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/967-0
03:39:56.299 --> 03:40:01.484
<v Josh Sparkes>So you that's been able to accept that
maybe that heads off a lot of those</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/965-0
03:39:56.379 --> 03:40:00.122
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's exactly what that's exactly what</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/965-1
03:40:00.122 --> 03:40:01.819
<v Mark Sedge>I'm thinking. They they will.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/967-1
03:40:01.484 --> 03:40:04.872
<v Josh Sparkes>questions, some of the ones,
the standard rates,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/966-0
03:40:03.539 --> 03:40:04.099
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, that's it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/967-2
03:40:04.872 --> 03:40:10.266
<v Josh Sparkes>especially when the rates have just
changed, you know for the financial year,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/967-3
03:40:10.266 --> 03:40:13.930
<v Josh Sparkes>we get lots of requests.
So audit reporting request,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/967-4
03:40:13.930 --> 03:40:15.659
<v Josh Sparkes>does they have dashboard?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/968-0
03:40:16.259 --> 03:40:21.299
<v Josh Sparkes>Or is there anywhere else? It's?
It's there, it's on Internet we can't get.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/970-0
03:40:21.259 --> 03:40:24.707
<v Mark Sedge>The thing is that we've got The thing is,
thing is team,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/970-1
03:40:24.707 --> 03:40:28.458
<v Mark Sedge>we know we've got a user community who
don't self help right,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/970-2
03:40:28.458 --> 03:40:33.298
<v Mark Sedge>who their first sort of route is to ping
somebody, e-mail somebody or whatever.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/969-0
03:40:29.419 --> 03:40:29.659
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/970-3
03:40:33.298 --> 03:40:37.715
<v Mark Sedge>So the more that you can sort of steer
them even if they come, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/970-4
03:40:37.715 --> 03:40:40.619
<v Mark Sedge>we coach them to come into the employee
centre.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/971-0
03:40:41.259 --> 03:40:44.566
<v Mark Sedge>And you know,
start asking the query request and then</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/971-1
03:40:44.566 --> 03:40:47.750
<v Mark Sedge>you can show them stuff.
That means one click away,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/971-2
03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:52.466
<v Mark Sedge>they get the answer like what are the
standard rates that you know when they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/971-3
03:40:52.466 --> 03:40:57.059
<v Mark Sedge>say rate query you list out the common
list of you know common ask things.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/973-0
03:40:57.699 --> 03:41:01.343
<v Mark Sedge>It just prevents that even coming in.
If you can do it now,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/972-0
03:41:00.739 --> 03:41:00.939
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/973-1
03:41:01.343 --> 03:41:04.563
<v Mark Sedge>they'll always be some they they just
won't read it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/973-2
03:41:04.563 --> 03:41:07.843
<v Mark Sedge>They're still populated fine,
but it gives, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/973-3
03:41:07.843 --> 03:41:12.764
<v Mark Sedge>if you can just stem the flow of a few by
presenting the right collateral or the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/973-4
03:41:12.764 --> 03:41:17.259
<v Mark Sedge>right Intel. I think that would help you.
And we can easily do that from.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/974-0
03:41:17.339 --> 03:41:22.152
<v Mark Sedge>The pick list. If you pick this topic,
these are your related subjects that they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/974-1
03:41:22.152 --> 03:41:23.579
<v Mark Sedge>could, you know, review.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/976-0
03:41:24.099 --> 03:41:27.043
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, there is a couple scenarios.
Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/975-0
03:41:25.219 --> 03:41:26.099
<v Mark Sedge>That makes sense.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/976-1
03:41:27.043 --> 03:41:31.867
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a couple of scenarios where we
could send them and find information.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/976-2
03:41:31.867 --> 03:41:35.751
<v Josh Sparkes>Most of them, though,
is about getting into 3 E to see what's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/976-3
03:41:35.751 --> 03:41:39.385
<v Josh Sparkes>happening with the client or the rates
that are on there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/976-4
03:41:39.385 --> 03:41:41.139
<v Josh Sparkes>But there's definitely some.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/978-0
03:41:41.819 --> 03:41:44.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I mean,
I know we're not touching on 3E,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/978-1
03:41:44.457 --> 03:41:48.949
<v Josh Sparkes>but is that something when we do the 3E?
Because it sounds like lots of things.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/978-2
03:41:48.949 --> 03:41:51.588
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't. I can't see.
I can't are the amounts.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/978-3
03:41:51.588 --> 03:41:56.023
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean the fact that you're giving them
visibility is a visibility of three E.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/978-4
03:41:56.023 --> 03:41:59.167
<v Josh Sparkes>So when they do the three conversations
or the upgrade,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/978-5
03:41:59.167 --> 03:42:00.739
<v Josh Sparkes>is this something that pees?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/979-0
03:42:00.979 --> 03:42:05.536
<v Josh Sparkes>Can get a visibility or their dashboard,
but it stops these questions coming I</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/979-1
03:42:05.536 --> 03:42:09.805
<v Josh Sparkes>mean, so I'm just parking it for now.
I think it's more about the access.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/979-2
03:42:09.805 --> 03:42:12.862
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's.
I mean fundamentally no harm in having</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/979-3
03:42:12.862 --> 03:42:16.958
<v Josh Sparkes>them see that. Yeah, we doing really well.
I mean, I mean, yeah, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/979-4
03:42:16.958 --> 03:42:20.419
<v Josh Sparkes>Please only is what I'm saying.
But I think it's something.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/980-0
03:42:20.459 --> 03:42:22.829
<v Josh Sparkes>And if you're getting lots of three
questions,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/980-1
03:42:22.829 --> 03:42:26.460
<v Josh Sparkes>but they're you're just giving them a
copy. I mean, it's not. It's not.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/980-2
03:42:26.460 --> 03:42:30.242
<v Josh Sparkes>It's convention. You can't see it,
but it's something that you maybe can't</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/980-3
03:42:30.242 --> 03:42:33.520
<v Josh Sparkes>for free visibility. Yeah.
It's whether they would understand it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/980-4
03:42:33.520 --> 03:42:36.798
<v Josh Sparkes>looks as well. Yeah. Yeah.
It's it's it's also whether they will</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/980-5
03:42:36.798 --> 03:42:40.379
<v Josh Sparkes>understand or whether they want to
understand as well. You know, it's.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/981-0
03:42:41.659 --> 03:42:45.026
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just, you know,
on that usually you get lots of to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/981-1
03:42:45.026 --> 03:42:48.514
<v Josh Sparkes>address when you,
you know even I mean it's it's more get</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/981-2
03:42:48.514 --> 03:42:53.565
<v Josh Sparkes>stuff through because handled even you be
coming to an end so they want to find out</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/981-3
03:42:53.565 --> 03:42:58.555
<v Josh Sparkes>other other about severe negotiate rates
they want to find out what rates could go</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/981-4
03:42:58.555 --> 03:43:00.059
<v Josh Sparkes>up and then there's that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/982-0
03:43:00.219 --> 03:43:04.548
<v Josh Sparkes>But I've all reason matters numbers.
Look at that and I've put that and that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/982-1
03:43:04.548 --> 03:43:08.934
<v Josh Sparkes>helps them decide how they will move
forward with the negotiations. But yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/982-2
03:43:08.934 --> 03:43:11.914
<v Josh Sparkes>they are really, there is definitely some,
you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/982-3
03:43:11.914 --> 03:43:16.019
<v Josh Sparkes>if we could refer them to the standard
rate card. So you could get that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/983-0
03:43:16.699 --> 03:43:21.573
<v Josh Sparkes>And there's some in the future as well.
If we get that one from Deb's client</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/983-1
03:43:21.573 --> 03:43:26.701
<v Josh Sparkes>terms website where they may be able to
get access to the engagement letters and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/983-2
03:43:26.701 --> 03:43:30.246
<v Josh Sparkes>stuff like that,
so that the actual what's happening to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/983-3
03:43:30.246 --> 03:43:32.019
<v Josh Sparkes>that client, the rates that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/984-0
03:43:32.619 --> 03:43:35.780
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that it's amazing.
Between now and go live,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/984-1
03:43:35.780 --> 03:43:39.700
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe that's a yeah.
A notification back with us. Yeah. Alex,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/984-2
03:43:39.700 --> 03:43:43.936
<v Josh Sparkes>you wanted to say? Yeah,
I was just going to say a bit in terms of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/984-3
03:43:43.936 --> 03:43:47.793
<v Josh Sparkes>the data, obviously,
we're going to have conversations about</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/984-4
03:43:47.793 --> 03:43:51.903
<v Josh Sparkes>risk to GDH, for example.
But we also know that the frequency of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/984-5
03:43:51.903 --> 03:43:52.219
<v Josh Sparkes>that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/985-0
03:43:52.339 --> 03:43:56.287
<v Josh Sparkes>The update of it means that those
discrepancies between which G e.g.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/985-1
03:43:56.287 --> 03:44:00.807
<v Josh Sparkes>DH would provide and what will actually
be in the and from the call yesterday.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/985-2
03:44:00.807 --> 03:44:05.041
<v Josh Sparkes>It's quite clear there's no new
integrations to three because of the fact</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/985-3
03:44:05.041 --> 03:44:08.245
<v Josh Sparkes>that it's been upgraded through 2627,
so we just start,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/985-4
03:44:08.245 --> 03:44:10.419
<v Josh Sparkes>we just need to see is it good enough.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/986-0
03:44:10.979 --> 03:44:18.153
<v Josh Sparkes>Or do we have enough consent and risk
covering potentially using some of that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/986-1
03:44:18.153 --> 03:44:23.304
<v Josh Sparkes>data to do any of that stuff?
So so it's general. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/986-2
03:44:23.304 --> 03:44:26.339
<v Josh Sparkes>And then I think we're on manage.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/987-0
03:44:26.699 --> 03:44:30.641
<v Josh Sparkes>On cards,
which I think we that should be a quick,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/987-1
03:44:30.641 --> 03:44:35.279
<v Josh Sparkes>quick, yeah. There you go. Three. Yeah,
that's quite quick.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/987-2
03:44:35.279 --> 03:44:39.067
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got half an hour to talk about time
cards.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/987-3
03:44:39.067 --> 03:44:45.019
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got a couple of wrap up things on
our site to do and that'll be, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/988-0
03:44:45.979 --> 03:44:50.697
<v Josh Sparkes>They're all.
They're all the things we can unheard new.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/988-1
03:44:50.697 --> 03:44:55.920
<v Josh Sparkes>You get an address,
you get an address from the PE and and we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/988-2
03:44:55.920 --> 03:45:01.312
<v Josh Sparkes>we need the matter number.
Generally we need the dates as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/988-3
03:45:01.312 --> 03:45:05.019
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're asking us to do something
about.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/989-0
03:45:05.539 --> 03:45:09.834
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you know something that I want to
say for a certain person and they want us</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/989-1
03:45:09.834 --> 03:45:13.822
<v Josh Sparkes>to unculture or you know what I mean.
There are reverse or whatever they want</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/989-2
03:45:13.822 --> 03:45:16.430
<v Josh Sparkes>us to do.
So there is certain information we would</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/989-3
03:45:16.430 --> 03:45:19.140
<v Josh Sparkes>require upfront and I don't know all of
that, right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/989-4
03:45:19.140 --> 03:45:23.027
<v Josh Sparkes>That's not insane because I don't do the
same. But you can share. But yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/989-5
03:45:23.027 --> 03:45:25.379
<v Josh Sparkes>I can't feel that with you and not that's
an.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/990-0
03:45:25.459 --> 03:45:29.616
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it does time cards environment
they they they they. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/990-1
03:45:29.616 --> 03:45:34.528
<v Josh Sparkes>So they do and they would be I'll get
that information exactly what's needed.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/990-2
03:45:34.528 --> 03:45:39.126
<v Josh Sparkes>So some places that people remember or
whatever but we can get the basic</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/990-3
03:45:39.126 --> 03:45:44.417
<v Josh Sparkes>information on the the request that would
yeah that would be good and that location</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/990-4
03:45:44.417 --> 03:45:45.299
<v Josh Sparkes>would you say.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/991-0
03:45:45.419 --> 03:45:48.297
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so also could it all come into a global</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/991-1
03:45:48.297 --> 03:45:53.137
<v Josh Sparkes>and you assign well that thing anybody
can and pick them up in yours, OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/991-2
03:45:53.137 --> 03:45:57.258
<v Josh Sparkes>sounds good and that is that is really
for that one it is one,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/991-3
03:45:57.258 --> 03:46:01.118
<v Josh Sparkes>so that's important.
But I'll let you know the information</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/991-4
03:46:01.118 --> 03:46:02.099
<v Josh Sparkes>with Minecraft.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/992-0
03:46:02.659 --> 03:46:07.260
<v Josh Sparkes>We meet the request and what is also good.
There's certain parts that we don't do</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/992-1
03:46:07.260 --> 03:46:11.076
<v Josh Sparkes>and so that might be a good thing to put
in there as well. So yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/992-2
03:46:11.076 --> 03:46:14.892
<v Josh Sparkes>sort of like we're splitting them.
I think it was defences and then</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/992-3
03:46:14.892 --> 03:46:19.100
<v Josh Sparkes>transferring time going since it's always
in the UK or offensive generally</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/992-4
03:46:19.100 --> 03:46:22.299
<v Josh Sparkes>generally, yeah.
More splitting that would go offensive.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/993-0
03:46:22.579 --> 03:46:27.696
<v Josh Sparkes>And then if there is transmitting time,
do that, we do that. So we do these three,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/993-1
03:46:27.696 --> 03:46:31.704
<v Josh Sparkes>yes, with other tasks or time cards. Oh,
OK that other teams do.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/993-2
03:46:31.704 --> 03:46:36.081
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's that knowledge thing. OK.
So it's making aware if you want to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/993-3
03:46:36.081 --> 03:46:39.472
<v Josh Sparkes>transfer time.
I can look at those all those processes</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/993-4
03:46:39.472 --> 03:46:41.939
<v Josh Sparkes>for time cards and then we can make the.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/994-0
03:46:42.299 --> 03:46:47.431
<v Josh Sparkes>Over workflow,
but depending on as you said for reverse</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/994-1
03:46:47.431 --> 03:46:53.297
<v Josh Sparkes>unpersion ends split,
I'll transfer on tape is that is that all</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/994-2
03:46:53.297 --> 03:47:01.179
<v Josh Sparkes>of them? Are there more that you don't do?
Oh, OK. Less than the time is N CES. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/995-0
03:47:02.019 --> 03:47:03.619
<v Josh Sparkes>Transferring is the hockey team.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/996-0
03:47:05.899 --> 03:47:10.645
<v Josh Sparkes>Let's just try to take a walk into
another place. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/996-1
03:47:10.645 --> 03:47:14.942
<v Josh Sparkes>I can. We need advance times,
and we can an entire person. But OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/996-2
03:47:14.942 --> 03:47:19.368
<v Josh Sparkes>we can transfer from one. OK,
so you get that it tends to be the PE.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/996-3
03:47:19.368 --> 03:47:20.779
<v Josh Sparkes>The numbers. Yeah. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/997-0
03:47:23.379 --> 03:47:26.944
<v Josh Sparkes>Give that details as you say,
if you can give me the checklist,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/997-1
03:47:26.944 --> 03:47:31.567
<v Josh Sparkes>I want no approval required, no approval,
no, and then go into three. Change them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/997-2
03:47:31.567 --> 03:47:35.299
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, no. These are in tap in three years.
And then those completes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/997-3
03:47:35.299 --> 03:47:39.477
<v Josh Sparkes>And there's no reason why you might say
I'm. You're checking any of these.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/997-4
03:47:39.477 --> 03:47:42.819
<v Josh Sparkes>They are just assumed to be completed.
So you just tell us.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/998-0
03:47:42.979 --> 03:47:47.073
<v Josh Sparkes>We would obviously we should go back if
we can't find the other stuff with</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/998-1
03:47:47.073 --> 03:47:49.803
<v Josh Sparkes>effective dates and no, no,
because either dates.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/998-2
03:47:49.803 --> 03:47:53.897
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's like you're saying that you
worked on the 25th of October. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/998-3
03:47:53.897 --> 03:47:57.282
<v Josh Sparkes>You've done 4 hours.
And on a certain project and you'll just</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/998-4
03:47:57.282 --> 03:48:00.339
<v Josh Sparkes>say you're saying, you know, Ashley,
can you change it?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/999-0
03:48:03.179 --> 03:48:07.707
<v Josh Sparkes>And I'm assuming it's a they've reached
out because time house are locked up at a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/999-1
03:48:07.707 --> 03:48:11.518
<v Josh Sparkes>certain time. Is it like, I mean,
so once they've been submitted it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/999-2
03:48:11.518 --> 03:48:14.224
<v Josh Sparkes>that didn't say we can. So once submitted,
yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/999-3
03:48:14.224 --> 03:48:17.427
<v Josh Sparkes>there's always been submitted approved,
presumably. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/999-4
03:48:17.427 --> 03:48:19.139
<v Josh Sparkes>That's probably sometime, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1000-0
03:48:19.779 --> 03:48:19.899
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1001-0
03:48:20.979 --> 03:48:25.046
<v Josh Sparkes>Bits of timing preemptively for some of
the work. Yeah, you can amend that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1001-1
03:48:25.046 --> 03:48:27.776
<v Josh Sparkes>Can't you tend to be I I don't know,
to go honest,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1001-2
03:48:27.776 --> 03:48:30.719
<v Josh Sparkes>but my assumption is obviously they come
through. Yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1001-3
03:48:30.719 --> 03:48:35.054
<v Josh Sparkes>we have to change it because they can.
So I mean maybe that's a question you can</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1001-4
03:48:35.054 --> 03:48:38.854
<v Josh Sparkes>ask has it been submitted approved. Yes,
we can do for some instances.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1001-5
03:48:38.854 --> 03:48:40.139
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you haven't. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1002-0
03:48:40.819 --> 03:48:44.100
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not locked down for clear.
It's either you can still make your</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1002-1
03:48:44.100 --> 03:48:48.106
<v Josh Sparkes>amendments yourself. Well. Interestingly,
sometimes they'll put annual leave in as</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1002-2
03:48:48.106 --> 03:48:51.291
<v Josh Sparkes>well, and they'll ask us.
So then they cancel it and then they're</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1002-3
03:48:51.291 --> 03:48:54.620
<v Josh Sparkes>asking us to reverse that.
So I don't know whether they've submitted</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1002-4
03:48:54.620 --> 03:48:57.757
<v Josh Sparkes>it too early or whether they could or
they were on annual leave.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1002-5
03:48:57.757 --> 03:48:58.819
<v Josh Sparkes>And they have to work.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1003-0
03:49:00.939 --> 03:49:06.284
<v Josh Sparkes>So that sounds. Sorry, sorry.
Would we have like 110 card form then?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1003-1
03:49:06.284 --> 03:49:11.165
<v Josh Sparkes>But we would have like the definite
reasons or so, yeah, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1003-2
03:49:11.165 --> 03:49:15.735
<v Josh Sparkes>And all of these would be one form which
we're rolling up.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1003-3
03:49:15.735 --> 03:49:19.299
<v Josh Sparkes>You know we we consolidate it all a bit
like.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1004-0
03:49:19.659 --> 03:49:23.926
<v Josh Sparkes>Wouldn't matter.
You'd probably have one form with who</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1004-1
03:49:23.926 --> 03:49:28.504
<v Josh Sparkes>would it work with,
given that splitting is done by fensis</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1004-2
03:49:28.504 --> 03:49:32.616
<v Josh Sparkes>who are in IT.
See they selected splitting time card</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1004-3
03:49:32.616 --> 03:49:37.659
<v Josh Sparkes>right and then the field up here. OK,
so we'll come to you guys.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1006-0
03:49:38.139 --> 03:49:40.810
<v Josh Sparkes>It'll go straight offences team who need
help.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1006-1
03:49:40.810 --> 03:49:43.709
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's transfer of would there be a
notification?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1006-2
03:49:43.709 --> 03:49:47.347
<v Josh Sparkes>Leave them aware that it's not come to us
or you could do that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1006-3
03:49:47.347 --> 03:49:50.530
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean if that's the case,
I mean it could be a prompt,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1006-4
03:49:50.530 --> 03:49:53.259
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be a prompt screen before they
submit.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1007-0
03:49:53.819 --> 03:49:55.219
<v Josh Sparkes>But those teams don't make sense.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1008-0
03:49:56.619 --> 03:50:00.169
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh yeah, we'll double check.
Fences are fences are using sharewell,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1008-1
03:50:00.169 --> 03:50:03.772
<v Josh Sparkes>so I think they will be service now,
but I'm not sure about the hub.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1008-2
03:50:03.772 --> 03:50:06.070
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we'd need to double check that.
OK,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1008-3
03:50:06.070 --> 03:50:08.524
<v Josh Sparkes>because how would that work with the hub
then?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1008-4
03:50:08.524 --> 03:50:12.649
<v Josh Sparkes>Wouldn't we just get the hub of the
e-mail address? Maybe at least they don't.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1008-5
03:50:12.649 --> 03:50:15.939
<v Josh Sparkes>The transfer sign the transfer.
So say transfer was an option.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1009-0
03:50:16.419 --> 03:50:19.859
<v Josh Sparkes>But actually it turns out it's the hub
that does it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1009-1
03:50:19.859 --> 03:50:23.363
<v Josh Sparkes>How does that work if it's coming through
the portal,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1009-2
03:50:23.363 --> 03:50:28.426
<v Josh Sparkes>would it not very much with an individual
e-mail? Yeah. So they've got, like,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1009-3
03:50:28.426 --> 03:50:33.099
<v Josh Sparkes>a shared mailbox, don't they?
Like Hub UK at dot com or whatever it is.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1010-0
03:50:34.499 --> 03:50:34.859
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1011-0
03:50:41.339 --> 03:50:42.619
<v Josh Sparkes>That would be fun, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1012-0
03:50:45.099 --> 03:50:45.259
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1013-0
03:50:49.059 --> 03:50:53.266
<v Josh Sparkes>Or it could be that you you see them all,
that you're not responsible for.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1013-1
03:50:53.266 --> 03:50:56.239
<v Josh Sparkes>You got the ability of the ageing. Say,
for example,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1013-2
03:50:56.239 --> 03:51:00.110
<v Josh Sparkes>it went to a pub and on your cue,
it's like ageing for ages. I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1013-3
03:51:00.110 --> 03:51:03.980
<v Josh Sparkes>that could be a bit where you sort of
think obviously been sat here.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1013-4
03:51:03.980 --> 03:51:07.739
<v Josh Sparkes>I might nudge them to the you know they
they all resend the notes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1014-0
03:51:07.979 --> 03:51:12.640
<v Josh Sparkes>Or reminder is triggered because it's in
ServiceNow that they keep getting the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1014-1
03:51:12.640 --> 03:51:15.532
<v Josh Sparkes>reminder,
but it's certainly even though they're</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1014-2
03:51:15.532 --> 03:51:18.954
<v Josh Sparkes>not in ServiceNow,
they could be notified via e-mail that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1014-3
03:51:18.954 --> 03:51:22.376
<v Josh Sparkes>this is required.
You'll get the details of that original</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1014-4
03:51:22.376 --> 03:51:26.979
<v Josh Sparkes>form that servicenow's task is and
they're not got access to ServiceNow, but.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1015-0
03:51:27.419 --> 03:51:30.270
<v Josh Sparkes>And they've got all the details
associated with that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1015-1
03:51:30.270 --> 03:51:34.229
<v Josh Sparkes>It would be request awards because I
think if it can ideally direct to the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1015-2
03:51:34.229 --> 03:51:36.922
<v Josh Sparkes>right team,
then obviously the amount that's going</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1015-3
03:51:36.922 --> 03:51:39.825
<v Josh Sparkes>into to your view,
in fact it's not all of that. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1015-4
03:51:39.825 --> 03:51:43.099
<v Josh Sparkes>the education as well as what I was, 20%.
Yeah, what's a hub.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1016-0
03:51:44.179 --> 03:51:47.309
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, sounds like very long.
What's their their role?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1016-1
03:51:47.309 --> 03:51:51.402
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've got the keys to do what to do
with building and all that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1016-2
03:51:51.402 --> 03:51:55.796
<v Josh Sparkes>The Hub team are like the and their
assistants or not to use assistance,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1016-3
03:51:55.796 --> 03:51:59.287
<v Josh Sparkes>but they're like,
and they will do more operations. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1016-4
03:51:59.287 --> 03:52:02.236
<v Josh Sparkes>they'll do. Like,
they will not do the building.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1016-5
03:52:02.236 --> 03:52:03.019
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably the.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1017-0
03:52:04.019 --> 03:52:07.840
<v Josh Sparkes>They're able to do more administrative
stuff, and so,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1017-1
03:52:07.840 --> 03:52:13.713
<v Josh Sparkes>even though they're doing billing or bits,
they won't be associated any tasks they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1017-2
03:52:13.713 --> 03:52:19.019
<v Josh Sparkes>don't use share all today or the picture.
I don't think. I don't think so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1017-3
03:52:19.019 --> 03:52:22.699
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't think I can double check if I
double check.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1018-0
03:52:23.579 --> 03:52:27.840
<v Josh Sparkes>They fall under operation.
Actually they use service desk plus. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1018-1
03:52:27.840 --> 03:52:31.858
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So they do. Yeah.
Which is currently what expenses use just</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1018-2
03:52:31.858 --> 03:52:35.084
<v Josh Sparkes>now as well.
Coming off that and going on in service</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1018-3
03:52:35.084 --> 03:52:37.702
<v Josh Sparkes>now.
So does it mean that hub will come on</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1018-4
03:52:37.702 --> 03:52:42.146
<v Josh Sparkes>service now because I know expenses use a
service desk and it will come.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1018-5
03:52:42.146 --> 03:52:43.059
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think for.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1019-0
03:52:43.219 --> 03:52:46.312
<v Josh Sparkes>Expenses lens came to get,
like Rhiannon Cole,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1019-1
03:52:46.312 --> 03:52:51.577
<v Josh Sparkes>etcetera off that to go into service now
because I think operations can see so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1019-2
03:52:51.577 --> 03:52:56.447
<v Josh Sparkes>So expenses was a part of hub which we
have brought in to ask now, right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1019-3
03:52:56.447 --> 03:53:00.790
<v Josh Sparkes>So the remaining services,
what Hub is right now I don't think so</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1019-4
03:53:00.790 --> 03:53:02.699
<v Josh Sparkes>because that falls under OPS.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1020-0
03:53:03.179 --> 03:53:06.005
<v Josh Sparkes>Exactly.
OPS is not coming then they will not come.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1020-1
03:53:06.005 --> 03:53:09.756
<v Josh Sparkes>But that's my understanding. Yeah. Yeah.
So just expenses right now.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1020-2
03:53:09.756 --> 03:53:12.528
<v Josh Sparkes>So expenses will be expensive is coming.
Yeah. OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1020-3
03:53:12.528 --> 03:53:15.083
<v Josh Sparkes>But if that was want to be lines with
harbour,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1020-4
03:53:15.083 --> 03:53:18.888
<v Josh Sparkes>they're not in terms now then it would
just be a route to the e-mail.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1020-5
03:53:18.888 --> 03:53:23.019
<v Josh Sparkes>But you can see along you could see the
life cycle of that or we could see.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1021-0
03:53:23.179 --> 03:53:26.198
<v Josh Sparkes>Service.
Now you could see that that's life and a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1021-1
03:53:26.198 --> 03:53:29.096
<v Josh Sparkes>reminder could be sent to their e-mail
address,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1021-2
03:53:29.096 --> 03:53:32.718
<v Josh Sparkes>but that's that would be up for you.
That goes to services.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1021-3
03:53:32.718 --> 03:53:37.609
<v Josh Sparkes>Plus it might be that we have to trigger
to create a ticketing services plus and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1021-4
03:53:37.609 --> 03:53:41.232
<v Josh Sparkes>we don't close up.
So I'll say your tickets been raised and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1021-5
03:53:41.232 --> 03:53:42.379
<v Josh Sparkes>sent as well, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1022-0
03:53:42.939 --> 03:53:46.017
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's a similar set up to share,
will they know you know how?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1022-1
03:53:46.017 --> 03:53:48.999
<v Josh Sparkes>I'd mentioned that so many emails,
like any of the mailboxes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1022-2
03:53:48.999 --> 03:53:51.644
<v Josh Sparkes>goes into outlook and then goes into a
process folder.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1022-3
03:53:51.644 --> 03:53:55.348
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's similar with service days
plus from what I can remember when we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1022-4
03:53:55.348 --> 03:53:57.753
<v Josh Sparkes>used to be on it years ago,
I think it's similar.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1022-5
03:53:57.753 --> 03:54:01.552
<v Josh Sparkes>It goes into outlook and then jumps into
some sort of service plus plus, yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1022-6
03:54:01.552 --> 03:54:02.659
<v Josh Sparkes>SB plus, we call it SB.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1023-0
03:54:02.899 --> 03:54:05.670
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
And the the management team was on there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1023-1
03:54:05.670 --> 03:54:10.345
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, yeah. Yeah. You're right. Yeah. OK,
that's good. But it can be routed. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1023-2
03:54:10.345 --> 03:54:13.578
<v Josh Sparkes>that would work. Cool.
But that's really good, I think.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1023-3
03:54:13.578 --> 03:54:16.580
<v Josh Sparkes>And Geraldine from a Rama perspective,
do you need,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1023-4
03:54:16.580 --> 03:54:20.967
<v Josh Sparkes>do you even need visibility if it goes to
the hub or fences? No, I haven't.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1023-5
03:54:20.967 --> 03:54:22.699
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't think so, but I think.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1024-0
03:54:22.739 --> 03:54:26.329
<v Josh Sparkes>It's good for the requester to see that
it's not ours. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1024-1
03:54:26.329 --> 03:54:29.095
<v Josh Sparkes>that's some sort of notification or
something,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1024-2
03:54:29.095 --> 03:54:33.451
<v Josh Sparkes>does that obviously admits that it will
be your request has gone to fins.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1024-3
03:54:33.451 --> 03:54:37.335
<v Josh Sparkes>Your request has gone to and that could
be, you know, programmes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1024-4
03:54:37.335 --> 03:54:39.219
<v Josh Sparkes>They know where it is and who's.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1025-0
03:54:39.659 --> 03:54:43.874
<v Josh Sparkes>Who's? Yeah. And on the board,
you'll be able to follow up with the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1025-1
03:54:43.874 --> 03:54:47.408
<v Josh Sparkes>correct team as well.
So it's not like you guys will get</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1025-2
03:54:47.408 --> 03:54:51.065
<v Josh Sparkes>follow-ups off the back of that if it's
with another team.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1025-3
03:54:51.065 --> 03:54:52.739
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there just one hub team?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1026-0
03:54:54.019 --> 03:54:59.194
<v Josh Sparkes>No,
but the hot team in Australia and and the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1026-1
03:54:59.194 --> 03:55:08.419
<v Josh Sparkes>hot team in Glasgow? Yeah, two locations.
Can I? Isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1026-2
03:55:08.419 --> 03:55:12.019
<v Josh Sparkes>Or do they fall under different?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1027-0
03:55:14.579 --> 03:55:19.112
<v Josh Sparkes>Box does all the wood stuff now,
don't they? Yes. Does that work stuff?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1027-1
03:55:19.112 --> 03:55:22.764
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's a very different. Yeah.
Set up to what we have.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1027-2
03:55:22.764 --> 03:55:27.361
<v Josh Sparkes>It's really it's a small office and so
they do they do a lot of combined</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1027-3
03:55:27.361 --> 03:55:30.635
<v Josh Sparkes>activity.
So in they don't have hub per SE but they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1027-4
03:55:30.635 --> 03:55:31.139
<v Josh Sparkes>will be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1028-0
03:55:31.419 --> 03:55:34.417
<v Josh Sparkes>What? What is it called? T ES. Yeah,
tango T ES as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1028-1
03:55:34.417 --> 03:55:36.731
<v Josh Sparkes>Who are a level below PE.
So they would be,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1028-2
03:55:36.731 --> 03:55:39.939
<v Josh Sparkes>they would be doing carrying out those
response very easily.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1029-0
03:55:41.939 --> 03:55:47.851
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good. That really good. All right,
I think that's everything. Everything.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1029-1
03:55:47.851 --> 03:55:52.888
<v Josh Sparkes>Unless Geraldine is anything we have not
covered covered everything.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1029-2
03:55:52.888 --> 03:55:57.414
<v Josh Sparkes>This is at the end, you know.
Today we'll pay it back to you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1029-3
03:55:57.414 --> 03:56:00.699
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe get some of those checklists from
you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1030-0
03:56:01.699 --> 03:56:05.906
<v Josh Sparkes>Because all of that launch stuff,
but that was very helpful today.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1030-1
03:56:05.906 --> 03:56:10.741
<v Josh Sparkes>Can I just check are there any peer
cheques or live cheques or anything like</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1030-2
03:56:10.741 --> 03:56:12.499
<v Josh Sparkes>that like the finance teams?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1031-0
03:56:14.299 --> 03:56:18.154
<v Josh Sparkes>That's that appointment. Yeah,
that there isn't that we have in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1031-1
03:56:18.154 --> 03:56:22.671
<v Josh Sparkes>conversations that potentially might be
one to introduce those. Yes. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1031-2
03:56:22.671 --> 03:56:27.249
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's not happening at the moment.
But there is maybe some of those ones</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1031-3
03:56:27.249 --> 03:56:29.659
<v Josh Sparkes>that may be high thresholds or you know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1032-0
03:56:29.819 --> 03:56:33.576
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Or as you said,
maybe for clients actually it's a volume</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1032-1
03:56:33.576 --> 03:56:37.333
<v Josh Sparkes>discounts, actually, yeah,
maybe on that one, there should be,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1032-2
03:56:37.333 --> 03:56:41.091
<v Josh Sparkes>should we take a note of that,
we could be incorporated? Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1032-3
03:56:41.091 --> 03:56:44.789
<v Josh Sparkes>we're looking into that at the moment.
I'm completing a list.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1032-4
03:56:44.789 --> 03:56:49.262
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm working with the business assurance
team to get a list of all the live</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1032-5
03:56:49.262 --> 03:56:49.739
<v Josh Sparkes>cheques.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1034-0
03:56:49.899 --> 03:56:52.544
<v Josh Sparkes>That we've got as well as a checklist as
well. Sorry.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1034-1
03:56:52.544 --> 03:56:56.609
<v Josh Sparkes>So I will hopefully have that soon, OK.
The Ask people checklist. There's so many.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1034-2
03:56:56.609 --> 03:57:00.429
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm trying to speak to AFG to see if
there's a quick way that I can get it</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1034-3
03:57:00.429 --> 03:57:03.025
<v Josh Sparkes>from share well instead of having me
manually do it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1034-4
03:57:03.025 --> 03:57:06.355
<v Josh Sparkes>but the business assurance team are going
to provide the other one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1034-5
03:57:06.355 --> 03:57:09.539
<v Josh Sparkes>So as soon as I've got them,
I'll make sure to save them in the.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1035-0
03:57:09.859 --> 03:57:13.882
<v Josh Sparkes>But if you don't have them at the moment,
it's something that we can incorporate.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1035-1
03:57:13.882 --> 03:57:17.268
<v Josh Sparkes>So for example, it will be blank,
checked wouldn't be it's been live</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1035-2
03:57:17.268 --> 03:57:19.574
<v Josh Sparkes>checked,
it will be reviewed by an an assigned</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1035-3
03:57:19.574 --> 03:57:21.782
<v Josh Sparkes>person. Yeah,
it's got an audit trail of it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1035-4
03:57:21.782 --> 03:57:25.560
<v Josh Sparkes>And I do think we'll probably we'll be
doing that with the volume discounts.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1035-5
03:57:25.560 --> 03:57:29.339
<v Josh Sparkes>Wouldn't talk about time with high volume
discounts. Yeah, volume discounts.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1036-0
03:57:30.139 --> 03:57:32.888
<v Josh Sparkes>Volume discounts,
volume discounts and I can make sure,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1036-1
03:57:32.888 --> 03:57:35.342
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
we're going to have this probably for all</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1036-2
03:57:35.342 --> 03:57:37.894
<v Josh Sparkes>ask teams.
If we add in new live cheques and stuff.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1036-3
03:57:37.894 --> 03:57:40.643
<v Josh Sparkes>Obviously I'm providing the info that
we've gotten now,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1036-4
03:57:40.643 --> 03:57:42.901
<v Josh Sparkes>but we still can kind of go what,
911 months?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1036-5
03:57:42.901 --> 03:57:45.355
<v Josh Sparkes>My math is terrible until we go into
service now.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1036-6
03:57:45.355 --> 03:57:48.939
<v Josh Sparkes>So there is going to be changes.
So we probably just need to think of a.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1037-0
03:57:49.379 --> 03:57:54.610
<v Josh Sparkes>To make sure that we keep these updated
on it as well. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1037-1
03:57:54.610 --> 03:57:59.179
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a good point. The last two slides.
Yeah. Yeah. Couple couple.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1037-2
03:57:59.179 --> 03:58:03.549
<v Josh Sparkes>You do you want to? Yeah.
So I don't know how what you feel about</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1037-3
03:58:03.549 --> 03:58:07.191
<v Josh Sparkes>today's session.
I think it was very technical. Again,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1037-4
03:58:07.191 --> 03:58:08.979
<v Josh Sparkes>a couple of other sessions.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1038-0
03:58:09.019 --> 03:58:14.198
<v Josh Sparkes>But I think the objective what was given
to me was to think how we can change,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1038-1
03:58:14.198 --> 03:58:18.132
<v Josh Sparkes>improve like Creative Hat to wear the
creative hat as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1038-2
03:58:18.132 --> 03:58:23.378
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know if you've got that or we
were too much into the technical sides of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1038-3
03:58:23.378 --> 03:58:24.099
<v Josh Sparkes>it because.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1039-0
03:58:24.699 --> 03:58:28.560
<v Josh Sparkes>I want to have no I mean you've got today.
You've got 50 price.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1039-1
03:58:28.560 --> 03:58:33.568
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean you've got a lot so in service now
that our remit is obviously to make that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1039-2
03:58:33.568 --> 03:58:37.248
<v Josh Sparkes>serve you know to provide a service,
streamline the service.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1039-3
03:58:37.248 --> 03:58:41.954
<v Josh Sparkes>You know all that added value you know as
and I'm acutely aware that there is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1039-4
03:58:41.954 --> 03:58:42.859
<v Josh Sparkes>clients behind.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1040-0
03:58:43.259 --> 03:58:47.759
<v Josh Sparkes>The complexity and you know their numbers,
it's not like doing artist school,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1040-1
03:58:47.759 --> 03:58:52.374
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a it's a math subject, you know,
so you can't be so creative. You know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1040-2
03:58:52.374 --> 03:58:55.547
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not that,
but probably what you're saying is that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1040-3
03:58:55.547 --> 03:58:59.931
<v Josh Sparkes>you want it to be streamlined and get the
ease of that. And I've seen that,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1040-4
03:58:59.931 --> 03:59:00.739
<v Josh Sparkes>I've actually.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1041-0
03:59:01.219 --> 03:59:04.122
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
I'll probably go away and I'll be parking</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1041-1
03:59:04.122 --> 03:59:08.478
<v Josh Sparkes>is that I did split them into or we split
them into client matter rate,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1041-2
03:59:08.478 --> 03:59:12.712
<v Josh Sparkes>time card actually in themselves,
they're not mutually exclusive as I</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1041-3
03:59:12.712 --> 03:59:15.979
<v Josh Sparkes>presented them there is that fluidity
within that so.</v>
