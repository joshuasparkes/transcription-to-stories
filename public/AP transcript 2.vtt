00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:10.931
<v Josh Sparkes>Louder and louder. This feedback,
isn't it? That one's on. OK. Is that OK?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/8-1
00:00:10.931 --> 00:00:15.551
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. OK.
So third party we discussed internally</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/8-2
00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Josh Sparkes>then coming through.
Make your requests and they fill in.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/10-0
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.559
<v Josh Sparkes>Urgent, probably everything's urgent.
But we can work on the matrix on there.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/10-1
00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:30.827
<v Josh Sparkes>That maybe it's for a value or a
particular customer or the effective end</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/10-2
00:00:30.827 --> 00:00:34.231
<v Josh Sparkes>dates, you know,
rather than them determining the surgeon.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/10-3
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:37.807
<v Josh Sparkes>And that can be done,
but effectively as the metrics that you</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/10-4
00:00:37.807 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Josh Sparkes>have upfront that they're completing,
that can empire.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/11-0
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.018
<v Josh Sparkes>That's which will be the insights and
then you can create that task then</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/11-1
00:00:47.018 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Josh Sparkes>question you invoice the attachment and
then you would get that task in your and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/11-2
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Josh Sparkes>would you want that assigned as a global
process that will be across all.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/12-0
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.288
<v Josh Sparkes>For both Australia and the UK,
that in it's going to be requested</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/12-1
00:01:03.288 --> 00:01:08.890
<v Josh Sparkes>internally there's no differences in the
way in which you handle the ingestion of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/12-2
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Josh Sparkes>those.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/13-0
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/14-0
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.287
<v Josh Sparkes>Can be on that.
So we've got the injection that you've</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/14-1
00:01:21.287 --> 00:01:26.374
<v Josh Sparkes>now received the request from unit work
in progress and I'm going to get into</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/14-2
00:01:26.374 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Josh Sparkes>that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/15-0
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.612
<v Josh Sparkes>Request to pay.
So you've got the invoice in front of you.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/15-1
00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:36.151
<v Josh Sparkes>The attachment in place and then really
digging deep on what you do with that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/15-2
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:38.943
<v Josh Sparkes>next.
Obviously it's not doing the activity and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/15-3
00:01:38.943 --> 00:01:41.561
<v Josh Sparkes>service now.
It's just handling the request.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/15-4
00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Josh Sparkes>You're using three, so.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/16-0
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Josh Sparkes>Are you checking? Obviously a vendor.
That's the first thing, like Brenda,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/16-1
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.693
<v Josh Sparkes>and then we can go into the vendor
workflow of that you,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/16-2
00:01:51.693 --> 00:01:53.260
<v Josh Sparkes>but also you're checking.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/17-0
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.416
<v Josh Sparkes>It's PO or non POI saw that as two
different processes.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/17-1
00:01:58.416 --> 00:02:02.867
<v Josh Sparkes>Whether you can talk me through that,
look how that is differentiated between</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/17-2
00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:04.180
<v Josh Sparkes>in the UK or Australia.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/18-0
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.604
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah,
there's two different ways that we</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/18-1
00:02:11.604 --> 00:02:15.304
<v Josh Sparkes>process.
Some noises just say whether they are</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/18-2
00:02:15.304 --> 00:02:20.894
<v Josh Sparkes>going through the P to P system just say
or if they are out with that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/18-3
00:02:20.894 --> 00:02:23.020
<v Josh Sparkes>If they are through P to P.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/19-0
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.282
<v Josh Sparkes>The invoice in an ideal world should come
to us with the PO.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/19-1
00:02:27.282 --> 00:02:31.353
<v Josh Sparkes>Fairly good receipted good to go.
So when we get that invoice,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/19-2
00:02:31.353 --> 00:02:35.037
<v Josh Sparkes>we would open it,
we would see the purchase order on the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/19-3
00:02:35.037 --> 00:02:38.333
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice.
We have a copy of the invoice and then we</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/19-4
00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:43.180
<v Josh Sparkes>would then go into 3 E fill up the
purchase order and process the invoice.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/20-0
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.375
<v Josh Sparkes>Fetch the invoice,
process the invoice and then close the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/20-1
00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Josh Sparkes>ticket and share will,
because that's the invoice fully</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/20-2
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.180
<v Josh Sparkes>processed. OK, but sometimes it doesn't,
not necessarily up like that you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/20-3
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.999
<v Josh Sparkes>so they might not.
It might be APO applicable vendor but a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/20-4
00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.460
<v Josh Sparkes>purchase order hasn't been raised yet.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/21-0
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.976
<v Josh Sparkes>So in that case what we do is we still
register them on to 3 E so that we've got</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/21-1
00:03:08.976 --> 00:03:13.853
<v Josh Sparkes>by the ability of them,
but we put them on as a meeting purchase</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/21-2
00:03:13.853 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Josh Sparkes>order and then we go back into share will
and we and the subject line.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/22-0
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.352
<v Josh Sparkes>Put the index number from three East so
that we can tie it up to the invoice,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/22-1
00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:30.311
<v Josh Sparkes>the invoice Judy, the invoice vendor name,
and the invoice number,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/22-2
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Josh Sparkes>and then what we do is we send it on to
the business and say.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/23-0
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.714
<v Josh Sparkes>He needs a purchase order basically for
this invoice.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/23-1
00:03:38.714 --> 00:03:41.542
<v Josh Sparkes>Then we park it and keep it in our
pending queue,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/23-2
00:03:41.542 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Josh Sparkes>which isn't ideal because if you pick up
then it's coming back into your tiers so</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/23-3
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.535
<v Josh Sparkes>then that takes into things like doesn't
take like if you're on holiday then</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/23-4
00:03:50.535 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Josh Sparkes>you're relying on other people going into
Europeans and then packing things up.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/24-0
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.167
<v Josh Sparkes>And then again,
once the business come back,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/24-1
00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:04.144
<v Josh Sparkes>then we should ideally get a notification
on that same ticket. But again,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/24-2
00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:08.853
<v Josh Sparkes>that doesn't necessarily happen.
Sometimes it generates a new ticket.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/24-3
00:04:08.853 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Josh Sparkes>So somebody else could pick it up.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/25-0
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.816
<v Josh Sparkes>And then you've got this pending ticket
there that's already been resolved</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/25-1
00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:18.639
<v Josh Sparkes>because someone's picked it up in another
ticket.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/25-2
00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.214
<v Josh Sparkes>So we heavily rely on pending just now
because we don't have a work through loan</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/25-3
00:04:23.214 --> 00:04:27.620
<v Josh Sparkes>through share well to send it on to
somebody until they've done their bit so.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/26-0
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.694
<v Josh Sparkes>It's quite can your pains and cure can
get quite hard to manage.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/26-1
00:04:32.694 --> 00:04:38.062
<v Josh Sparkes>So it sounds like the first gate from
receiving an invoice is EO specific</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/26-2
00:04:38.062 --> 00:04:44.082
<v Josh Sparkes>tonight and not again trivialising that,
but it could be you're stating is if it's</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/26-3
00:04:44.082 --> 00:04:44.300
<v Josh Sparkes>PO.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/27-0
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.892
<v Josh Sparkes>And then it requires it.
Then it's either it's,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/27-1
00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:52.605
<v Josh Sparkes>it is there and you can see to the next
casing.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/27-2
00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:57.632
<v Josh Sparkes>But if it is awaiting appeal for the
reason that it's not there.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/27-3
00:04:57.632 --> 00:05:01.500
<v Josh Sparkes>You can almost as a notification put that
manage.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/28-0
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.176
<v Josh Sparkes>Invoice that we're doing in a waiting PO,
which I mean a notification could be sent</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/28-1
00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:09.847
<v Josh Sparkes>at that point that you know that you're
processing,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/28-2
00:05:09.847 --> 00:05:13.855
<v Josh Sparkes>but that's not the state that will remain
in and that you can often find that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/28-3
00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:16.219
<v Josh Sparkes>information and come back to it.
So it's not,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/28-4
00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:20.381
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not in a holding state and no reason
like everything becomes pending before</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/28-5
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:21.460
<v Josh Sparkes>waiting on something.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/29-0
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.714
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's an actual activity.
It's the sort of first gating after that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/29-1
00:05:25.714 --> 00:05:28.352
<v Josh Sparkes>receiving that invoice.
Is that a good state?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/29-2
00:05:28.352 --> 00:05:32.825
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've got them either PO or long.
PO and PO is processed or not and we've</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/29-3
00:05:32.825 --> 00:05:35.980
<v Josh Sparkes>got on hold.
If you're waiting that clear information.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/30-0
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.128
<v Josh Sparkes>That work for you in the workflow,
the first gate to your new coming work in</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/30-1
00:05:43.128 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Josh Sparkes>progress awaiting PO or then goes on to
the next stage which is best for payment.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/31-0
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.007
<v Josh Sparkes>It sounds like a lot of your activity
within Korean, isn't it?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/31-1
00:05:58.007 --> 00:06:00.949
<v Josh Sparkes>The heavy bit of the work is outside the
service,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/31-2
00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.657
<v Josh Sparkes>which is basically just now using sharing
to as a workflow like organic border.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/31-3
00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:09.246
<v Josh Sparkes>It has no safe, particularly. Yeah.
So we have to then like,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/31-4
00:06:09.246 --> 00:06:13.660
<v Josh Sparkes>so just now if we've got one like that
and we send it out to the business.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/32-0
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.520
<v Josh Sparkes>We then put it in pending,
but you can choose when it comes back</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/32-1
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.305
<v Josh Sparkes>into your like your tasks again.
So what I normally do when I'm doing it</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/32-2
00:06:23.305 --> 00:06:28.155
<v Josh Sparkes>as I put it in according to Judy,
so that if I don't have a response back</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/32-3
00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:32.546
<v Josh Sparkes>when that invoice is due,
it flags to me and then I can chase that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/32-4
00:06:32.546 --> 00:06:32.940
<v Josh Sparkes>again.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/33-0
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.171
<v Josh Sparkes>But that's the way that we're managing it
to say, but that's it has it comes back.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/33-1
00:06:38.171 --> 00:06:42.505
<v Josh Sparkes>And to me and then I have to show and but
service now we'll do that for you.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/33-2
00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:46.838
<v Josh Sparkes>So that the fact that it's awaiting the
PO could be on your you know on your</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/33-3
00:06:46.838 --> 00:06:49.540
<v Josh Sparkes>dashboard for this is growing in age and
needs.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/34-0
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.265
<v Josh Sparkes>And so, even though you're saying,
if it's going to sign to you,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/34-1
00:06:53.265 --> 00:06:57.913
<v Josh Sparkes>the whole group considered, so all the,
all the activities would be if you're way</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/34-2
00:06:57.913 --> 00:07:01.542
<v Josh Sparkes>or you're busy on kids,
that other members of the team can pick</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/34-3
00:07:01.542 --> 00:07:04.660
<v Josh Sparkes>it up and it gives that ageing of that
ticket as well.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/35-0
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Josh Sparkes>And the state of which it's in,
that would be helpful.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/35-1
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.147
<v Josh Sparkes>So how how will that work in ServiceNow
then?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/35-2
00:07:13.147 --> 00:07:19.489
<v Josh Sparkes>So say I've put something on the system
as I've eaten just sort of in you being</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/35-3
00:07:19.489 --> 00:07:22.740
<v Josh Sparkes>in three E yeah, so I've put it on 3E as.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/36-0
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:28.600
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm waiting for you. I've got an invoice.
I'm nervous now I go to process it,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/36-1
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.380
<v Josh Sparkes>including L3E.
There's no purchase order there or the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/36-2
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.880
<v Josh Sparkes>purchase order that they've gave me
doesn't work.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/36-3
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.500
<v Josh Sparkes>I index it as a waiting purchase order.
Then I go to service now.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/37-0
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.484
<v Josh Sparkes>And then what happens to then?
I then assign that task to someone else,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/37-1
00:07:46.484 --> 00:07:49.618
<v Josh Sparkes>and then does that disappear from like
error cure?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/37-2
00:07:49.618 --> 00:07:54.657
<v Josh Sparkes>And then when we come back to us or does
that stuff it fails and like a games and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/37-3
00:07:54.657 --> 00:07:57.607
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
it's still changed things you can say</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/37-4
00:07:57.607 --> 00:08:01.540
<v Josh Sparkes>basically awaiting PO in service now and
if you manage the end.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/38-0
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.795
<v Josh Sparkes>When then still assigned to yourself,
you can reassign it if you need to.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/38-1
00:08:05.795 --> 00:08:10.266
<v Josh Sparkes>Effectively, once you start life cycle,
the ticket you remain, it's your queue,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/38-2
00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:13.005
<v Josh Sparkes>unless you're going to reassign it.
For example,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/38-3
00:08:13.005 --> 00:08:16.470
<v Josh Sparkes>it can be reassigned to a different
person that shouldn't be.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/38-4
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Josh Sparkes>That's something.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/39-0
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.156
<v Josh Sparkes>By some of the business, yes,
you're all out of violence outside of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/39-1
00:08:22.156 --> 00:08:25.224
<v Josh Sparkes>stocks now,
so you probably still need to keep that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/39-2
00:08:25.224 --> 00:08:29.624
<v Josh Sparkes>That case still assigned to your team for
just to set the state to awaiting</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/39-3
00:08:29.624 --> 00:08:33.098
<v Josh Sparkes>personal creation.
But you know that it's still waiting for</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/39-4
00:08:33.098 --> 00:08:36.340
<v Josh Sparkes>that PSP credit that I can process the
invoice as well.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/40-0
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:42.716
<v Josh Sparkes>And if something's assigned to myself,
the concerns, though in ServiceNow, yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/40-1
00:08:42.716 --> 00:08:48.321
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just trying to figure out in my head
house and if it's assigned to myself and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/40-2
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:51.397
<v Josh Sparkes>see I I'm on leave or off sick or
something.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/40-3
00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:55.020
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it easy for someone else in the team?
And that's.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/41-0
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.495
<v Josh Sparkes>And if you know that you're going,
I mean in the past where there's a change</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/41-1
00:09:02.495 --> 00:09:05.740
<v Josh Sparkes>that shift, you know,
so different engineers are coming on</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/41-2
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.645
<v Josh Sparkes>board and they literally take all their
tickets and reassign the ball.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/41-3
00:09:09.645 --> 00:09:13.660
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's the ability to do bulk reassign.
So you know, you're going away.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/42-0
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.078
<v Josh Sparkes>And everything's pending.
You can bulk reassigned to as well.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/42-1
00:09:18.078 --> 00:09:22.250
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got management on it,
but then we see if we see something</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/42-2
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.934
<v Josh Sparkes>you've definitely done it that way.
Even if my teammates can look at the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/42-3
00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:28.860
<v Josh Sparkes>something like across my team.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/43-0
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.550
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh my gosh. You know,
Josh is going to be out for all some time</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/43-1
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Josh Sparkes>when there is some that's part of.
It's a royal part of it's myself etcetera.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/43-2
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.410
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can kind of manage their own work
as well.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/43-3
00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.112
<v Josh Sparkes>It has that fluidity and it's not,
it is a.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/43-4
00:09:44.112 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Josh Sparkes>It's sat with you as a current state,
but that can be that can change that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/44-0
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.758
<v Josh Sparkes>Holiday stick, you know,
whatever you want to do that it's only</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/44-1
00:09:53.758 --> 00:09:56.500
<v Josh Sparkes>the old page and that absolutely, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/45-0
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.366
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good. So that'll be a state.
So then if it's non PO,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/45-1
00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:08.547
<v Josh Sparkes>so non parking path that everything now
has APO or non PO has been confirmed.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/45-2
00:10:08.547 --> 00:10:14.127
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the next statement describe that
next process to me what happens then it's</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/45-3
00:10:14.127 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Josh Sparkes>just.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/46-0
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.286
<v Josh Sparkes>Request for payments. Essentially,
it's just going to go through or non PO</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/46-1
00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:22.438
<v Josh Sparkes>invoices.
Sorry or maybe maybe separate them out if</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/46-2
00:10:22.438 --> 00:10:25.832
<v Josh Sparkes>they're different.
Different payment methods for those.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/46-3
00:10:25.832 --> 00:10:30.439
<v Josh Sparkes>So one would one will have a non PO but
it still has to be paid and one has</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/46-4
00:10:30.439 --> 00:10:32.500
<v Josh Sparkes>appeared and still has to be paid.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/48-0
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:42.309
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll get picked up on our weekly payment
runs if they're fully authorised and do</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/48-1
00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:49.180
<v Josh Sparkes>on that payment run we do weekly payment
runs for the UK, Luxembourg.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/49-0
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.260
<v Josh Sparkes>Thanks.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/50-0
00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:57.366
<v Josh Sparkes>Auburn and Poland this time we do weekly
payments for them in out with them,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/50-1
00:10:57.366 --> 00:11:01.328
<v Josh Sparkes>that's for GBP.
But then we also have a weekly foreign</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/50-2
00:11:01.328 --> 00:11:06.874
<v Josh Sparkes>payment run because they're foreign.
We don't have any electronic methods of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/50-3
00:11:06.874 --> 00:11:11.340
<v Josh Sparkes>payment, just like for their foreign.
So we have to manually.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/51-0
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.265
<v Josh Sparkes>So payments for them,
so they don't on a weekly basis as well.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/51-1
00:11:16.265 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Josh Sparkes>And for America are figures we do 2
payments per month.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/51-2
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:26.380
<v Josh Sparkes>So we do next month one and the name of
month one month and then you've got all</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/51-3
00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:31.140
<v Josh Sparkes>of your outliers like urgent and manual
request, ad hoc ad hoc.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/52-0
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:37.027
<v Josh Sparkes>But the method of paying them is the same
as I don't want a payment none or a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/52-1
00:11:37.027 --> 00:11:38.180
<v Josh Sparkes>payment none. OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/53-0
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:46.775
<v Josh Sparkes>That supports on whether it's PO or not,
and that was for both non PO and PO. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/53-1
00:11:46.775 --> 00:11:51.024
<v Josh Sparkes>And those weekly payment runs or weekly
foreign payment runs,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/53-2
00:11:51.024 --> 00:11:56.300
<v Josh Sparkes>you have a calendar event or schedule at
the moment where you just run them.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/54-0
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.377
<v Josh Sparkes>All the first one,
it's you know that you're going to run it</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/54-1
00:12:02.377 --> 00:12:06.927
<v Josh Sparkes>beginning of the week.
We've got scheduled requests amend the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/54-2
00:12:06.927 --> 00:12:11.331
<v Josh Sparkes>clause of part some like for cheques to
do for payment run.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/54-3
00:12:11.331 --> 00:12:14.340
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have integrations for our expenses.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/55-0
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.285
<v Josh Sparkes>And we've got intimations for our travel
providers as well.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/55-1
00:12:18.285 --> 00:12:23.450
<v Josh Sparkes>So they come through as an integration
and they should flow right through to the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/55-2
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.447
<v Josh Sparkes>vendor.
But if for any reason there's anything</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/55-3
00:12:26.447 --> 00:12:29.380
<v Josh Sparkes>that isn't right,
if the porting's not right.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/56-0
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.266
<v Josh Sparkes>It comes onto an action list,
so we have bought a flag and in before</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/56-1
00:12:34.266 --> 00:12:39.585
<v Josh Sparkes>the payments to make sure that there's
nothing on the action list because if</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/56-2
00:12:39.585 --> 00:12:45.318
<v Josh Sparkes>someone has picked up the action list to
say from what I can gather as open to all</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/56-3
00:12:45.318 --> 00:12:48.980
<v Josh Sparkes>the offices.
So any vouchers that are processed and.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/57-0
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:53.365
<v Josh Sparkes>They want to that list so we don't want
to have any sitting there ones so that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/57-1
00:12:53.365 --> 00:12:57.910
<v Josh Sparkes>other offices don't pick them up. But two,
if someone has picked them up and sitting</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/57-2
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.424
<v Josh Sparkes>on them,
then they're not going to pay because</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/57-3
00:13:00.424 --> 00:13:04.275
<v Josh Sparkes>they're not one of the vendor.
So we've got flags for that to make sure</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/57-4
00:13:04.275 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Josh Sparkes>that they're all picked up and they're
all processed before we start payments.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/58-0
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:14.073
<v Josh Sparkes>And then wait.
So I take the weekly payment run non PLP.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/58-1
00:13:14.073 --> 00:13:21.133
<v Josh Sparkes>They're essentially just checking that
each of those invoices are on that job.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/58-2
00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:25.780
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that what you're picking up or is it
picking up?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/59-0
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.865
<v Josh Sparkes>Any discrepancies that you need to flag
on the details from the weekly,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/59-1
00:13:30.865 --> 00:13:36.174
<v Josh Sparkes>one that you're finding or check in just
it's just a check on the apps less than 3</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/59-2
00:13:36.174 --> 00:13:41.420
<v Josh Sparkes>E to make sure that there's nothing still
to be posted before we carry it. Oh OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/60-0
00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:46.243
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes,
hundreds of voices in maximum funds</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/60-1
00:13:46.243 --> 00:13:49.740
<v Josh Sparkes>individually. OK, so in terms of.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/61-0
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:55.321
<v Josh Sparkes>Service. Now that's an activity.
I mean the only capture is a workflow.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/61-1
00:13:55.321 --> 00:13:59.851
<v Josh Sparkes>You know at the moment it's essentially
that you'll finally move that invoice</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/61-2
00:13:59.851 --> 00:14:03.452
<v Josh Sparkes>individually along.
So it's either waiting clear and then the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/61-3
00:14:03.452 --> 00:14:07.460
<v Josh Sparkes>next stage of requests for payments.
So it could be added to weekly.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/62-0
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:12.949
<v Josh Sparkes>Payment or being or state might be
processed for payments. Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/62-1
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:17.844
<v Josh Sparkes>waiting payment or process for payment or
request for payment.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/62-2
00:14:17.844 --> 00:14:22.894
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's a we've got.
We run our payment runs off due dates.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/62-3
00:14:22.894 --> 00:14:25.380
<v Josh Sparkes>So you might process an invoice.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/63-0
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:31.942
<v Josh Sparkes>Say that's not true for three weeks time,
so I think just request of payment is</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/63-1
00:14:31.942 --> 00:14:38.609
<v Josh Sparkes>fine. Yeah, it's not. Yeah. Yes. OK. As a,
as a say. Yeah. Yeah, that's standard. OK,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/63-2
00:14:38.609 --> 00:14:39.540
<v Josh Sparkes>that's good.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/64-0
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:45.149
<v Josh Sparkes>And then I haven't forgotten about vendor
details. By the way,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/64-1
00:14:45.149 --> 00:14:50.076
<v Josh Sparkes>whenever I thought of that and then let's
just say I didn't want to then go to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/64-2
00:14:50.076 --> 00:14:54.503
<v Josh Sparkes>manage payments. I, you know,
just want to be invoicing, look at that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/64-3
00:14:54.503 --> 00:14:58.620
<v Josh Sparkes>So we basically got it's coming, it's new,
it's work in progress.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/65-0
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:03.959
<v Josh Sparkes>PO or Long PO and then request for
payment and then basically on those</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/65-1
00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:09.358
<v Josh Sparkes>cheques as you're checking the invoice of
the checklist that you said that we need</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/65-2
00:15:09.358 --> 00:15:13.391
<v Josh Sparkes>to then check the vendor.
Going back to the workflows that we</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/65-3
00:15:13.391 --> 00:15:17.100
<v Josh Sparkes>mentioned this morning,
then we're managing that vendor.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/66-0
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.585
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's at the point where you've got
invoices come in,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/66-1
00:15:21.585 --> 00:15:26.656
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a new vendor that we don't know
about. We'll pick up that process.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/66-2
00:15:26.656 --> 00:15:32.361
<v Josh Sparkes>But we've discovered that will be a date
that will between you with and then sub</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/66-3
00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:36.940
<v Josh Sparkes>task of add new vendor correct that we
get. So and then in that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/67-0
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:42.520
<v Josh Sparkes>So says you're checking against the name,
legal name, address, contacts,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/67-1
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:47.933
<v Josh Sparkes>Iban or their bank details, right?
And I think you said this morning that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/67-2
00:15:47.933 --> 00:15:53.639
<v Josh Sparkes>there will be a standard checklist.
I don't know if you could share that with</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/67-3
00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:55.980
<v Josh Sparkes>us that you're checking against.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/68-0
00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:01.900
<v Josh Sparkes>And is that both for UK and Australia you
have that process?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/69-0
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:08.107
<v Josh Sparkes>This checklist isn't written down,
it's just something that's in our minds</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/69-1
00:16:08.107 --> 00:16:12.754
<v Josh Sparkes>that we know in three there are mandatory
fields that we have to complete.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/69-2
00:16:12.754 --> 00:16:17.711
<v Josh Sparkes>So half of the checklist is just making
sure that all the mandatory information</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/69-3
00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:22.420
<v Josh Sparkes>is like in terms company details but
constantly OK, yeah, we can get those.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/70-0
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.615
<v Josh Sparkes>And for the UK and then probably you
should think with probably the Australian</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/70-1
00:16:28.615 --> 00:16:33.559
<v Josh Sparkes>number versus the UK Company House number
and they are, but you need the regulatory.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/70-2
00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:37.748
<v Josh Sparkes>So they managed to build it there.
Any is there any enrichment that you</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/70-3
00:16:37.748 --> 00:16:41.180
<v Josh Sparkes>would like that you think actually be
very useful to have?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/71-0
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:47.231
<v Josh Sparkes>Your processes actually, if I had that,
I could report on that and make my</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/71-1
00:16:47.231 --> 00:16:49.700
<v Josh Sparkes>allocation of tasks a lot easier.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/72-0
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:53.180
<v Josh Sparkes>No.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/73-0
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.163
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's not sure not at the top of my
head. Contact please.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/73-1
00:16:58.163 --> 00:17:01.740
<v Josh Sparkes>Now that that will be on your green side
as well, wouldn't it?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/74-0
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:09.057
<v Josh Sparkes>I think I think I wanted to add some
fields for the vendor side.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/74-1
00:17:09.057 --> 00:17:16.192
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe just if you just got that in the
vendor that I can just double check with</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/74-2
00:17:16.192 --> 00:17:16.460
<v Josh Sparkes>my.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/75-0
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.700
<v Josh Sparkes>No. OK, that makes sense.
She's the standard. OK, good.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/75-1
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.100
<v Josh Sparkes>I think I was thinking about sanctions
and regulation.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/75-2
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:39.420
<v Josh Sparkes>We have a we'll cover that tomorrow.
That's going to be more casual. OK. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/75-3
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.780
<v Josh Sparkes>And the right to.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/76-0
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:47.853
<v Josh Sparkes>Receive. OK, OK. That's good.
I think as I was thinking about that was</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/76-1
00:17:47.853 --> 00:17:54.777
<v Josh Sparkes>whether you also capture whether I was
thinking attach of the value of the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/76-2
00:17:54.777 --> 00:17:58.100
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice that you're getting as well.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/77-0
00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.572
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
maybe the request decide they add that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/77-1
00:18:01.572 --> 00:18:05.480
<v Josh Sparkes>value because you could use that in your
dashboards that as you're getting</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/77-2
00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.439
<v Josh Sparkes>invoices in, there's a flag that says.
You know, we normally get it for 10,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/77-3
00:18:09.439 --> 00:18:12.096
<v Josh Sparkes>000 or 9000,
but this month actually it's a spike.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/77-4
00:18:12.096 --> 00:18:16.420
<v Josh Sparkes>So I was thinking of an additional field
that when you're getting that request for</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/77-5
00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.140
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice, even though it's on the.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/78-0
00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:22.619
<v Josh Sparkes>PDF or whichever falls in body and it's
also captured as a field.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/78-1
00:18:22.619 --> 00:18:27.740
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a value that you can report it.
You know if your own insights so that you</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/78-2
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:32.732
<v Josh Sparkes>could flag unusual activity that's
spiking or or coming in just currently we</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/78-3
00:18:32.732 --> 00:18:35.780
<v Josh Sparkes>don't have any mechanism to track the
invoice.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/79-0
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.940
<v Josh Sparkes>Volumes, I mean there is,
but it's very cumbersome.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/79-1
00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.621
<v Josh Sparkes>So apart from the value of course comes
by default.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/79-2
00:18:43.621 --> 00:18:47.231
<v Josh Sparkes>If you manage the counters where you know
like 21.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/79-3
00:18:47.231 --> 00:18:52.327
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think that would be something we
would expect from the dashboards.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/79-4
00:18:52.327 --> 00:18:55.300
<v Josh Sparkes>A few of those insights value the invoice.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/80-0
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.388
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe they're sending, you know,
it will seem that we think we're getting</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/80-1
00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:01.962
<v Josh Sparkes>one a month,
but actually we're getting three a month</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/80-2
00:19:01.962 --> 00:19:04.822
<v Josh Sparkes>because they submitted it three times and
we've managed to,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/80-3
00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:08.255
<v Josh Sparkes>you know picks up duplicates,
picks up those and you get those insights</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/80-4
00:19:08.255 --> 00:19:10.734
<v Josh Sparkes>that's coming in. So just again,
a couple of steps,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/80-5
00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:12.260
<v Josh Sparkes>how live will that dashboard be?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/81-0
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.484
<v Josh Sparkes>So is that like real time real time?
Real time? Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/81-1
00:19:16.484 --> 00:19:21.132
<v Josh Sparkes>there's real time tomorrow. Real time.
Is that you are renting later,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/81-2
00:19:21.132 --> 00:19:26.243
<v Josh Sparkes>isn't we have the billing discussion on
day five, so we'll leave it on that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/81-3
00:19:26.243 --> 00:19:28.700
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah. OK. Yeah, yeah, that's good.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/82-0
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.140
<v Josh Sparkes>None.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/83-0
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:36.393
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've done that new for wit processing,
non POPO any other.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/83-1
00:19:36.393 --> 00:19:40.458
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm saying that that's across the board
for both of you.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/83-2
00:19:40.458 --> 00:19:46.306
<v Josh Sparkes>For globalised I mean I just want to make
sure that sort of non PO obviously just</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/83-3
00:19:46.306 --> 00:19:47.020
<v Josh Sparkes>discussed.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/84-0
00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:52.688
<v Josh Sparkes>To request for payment PO there's some
activity, if it doesn't exist. OK,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/84-1
00:19:52.688 --> 00:19:56.362
<v Josh Sparkes>so I was just holding a couple of things
over here.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/84-2
00:19:56.362 --> 00:20:02.156
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think we need to understand we need
to put the approval piece as well in the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/84-3
00:20:02.156 --> 00:20:02.580
<v Josh Sparkes>sense.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/85-0
00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:07.301
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know about AUS,
but in the UK it goes to two levels of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/85-1
00:20:07.301 --> 00:20:10.961
<v Josh Sparkes>approval. Yes, all the payments. Yeah,
yeah, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/85-2
00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:15.841
<v Josh Sparkes>That's before the cashiers or somebody
like me hitting the payment.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/85-3
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:21.654
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's that needs to be incorporated
somewhere in the workflow and documented</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/85-4
00:20:21.654 --> 00:20:22.300
<v Josh Sparkes>properly.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/86-0
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.515
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've got the approvals next.
So I'm sort of thinking at which stages</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/86-1
00:20:27.515 --> 00:20:31.020
<v Josh Sparkes>do we then approve?
So maybe it's on value, maybe it's on.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/88-0
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.355
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.
So my question was not I would approve,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/88-1
00:20:35.355 --> 00:20:39.898
<v Josh Sparkes>say for example in this room I would,
Jill and I would approve the payments.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/88-2
00:20:39.898 --> 00:20:44.796
<v Josh Sparkes>But what I'm trying to say is that there
is a little bit of a work done behind the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/88-3
00:20:44.796 --> 00:20:49.340
<v Josh Sparkes>approval process as well. So for example,
the guys would prepare a schedule.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/89-0
00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:55.219
<v Josh Sparkes>That there are 10 approvers in Glasgow
and Jim and I are approving this week and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/89-1
00:20:55.219 --> 00:20:58.152
<v Josh Sparkes>I will be approving next week XYZ like
that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/89-2
00:20:58.152 --> 00:21:03.367
<v Josh Sparkes>So I don't know if that is something we
can incorporate like a scheduler plus a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/89-3
00:21:03.367 --> 00:21:08.060
<v Josh Sparkes>reminder for those people who are
approving the payments in that month.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/90-0
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.850
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
it's we have a typically instead of they</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/90-1
00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:15.488
<v Josh Sparkes>have an approved group as it were.
It's a particular role. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/90-2
00:21:15.488 --> 00:21:19.238
<v Josh Sparkes>Are you saying that you have it on the
scheduled? Yeah. Thank you.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/90-3
00:21:19.238 --> 00:21:23.380
<v Josh Sparkes>So Deborah prepares a schedule like,
two months, three months in advance.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/91-0
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.404
<v Josh Sparkes>So again,
it's the the reason I'm calling it now</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/91-1
00:21:26.404 --> 00:21:28.948
<v Josh Sparkes>because it's not,
it's not the approval process.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/91-2
00:21:28.948 --> 00:21:31.285
<v Josh Sparkes>It's basically an approval matrix.
You know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/91-3
00:21:31.285 --> 00:21:35.387
<v Josh Sparkes>like who can approve and who can approve
and schedule and. And a lot of times,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/91-4
00:21:35.387 --> 00:21:39.540
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, if I'm approving 2 weeks later,
I might be on holiday and I might not</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/91-5
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.060
<v Josh Sparkes>know, but.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/92-0
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.836
<v Josh Sparkes>Kind of like a reminder or some sort of
notification that there is available and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/92-1
00:21:45.836 --> 00:21:49.310
<v Josh Sparkes>some of that like I'm trying to sort of
envision, right,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/92-2
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:53.698
<v Josh Sparkes>so that you're not marking your own
homework essentially for approving,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/92-3
00:21:53.698 --> 00:21:57.660
<v Josh Sparkes>but you're doing it so that it's because
all of you can approve.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/93-0
00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.393
<v Josh Sparkes>Was is what you're saying about what
would? There's a.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/93-1
00:22:01.393 --> 00:22:06.354
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a Bank of you that can approve,
but you're doing it so that you're not</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/93-2
00:22:06.354 --> 00:22:10.686
<v Josh Sparkes>always single person that's gonna be
share the load effectively. OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/93-3
00:22:10.686 --> 00:22:14.140
<v Josh Sparkes>Could it please?
Such that you're all in the approval?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/94-0
00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:19.893
<v Josh Sparkes>Just challenging the schedule or not
schedule because that sounds an</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/94-1
00:22:19.893 --> 00:22:24.414
<v Josh Sparkes>additional piece of work.
Could it be that you're all in the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/94-2
00:22:24.414 --> 00:22:29.380
<v Josh Sparkes>approval role and any one of you could
approve no, because I mean.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/95-0
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.743
<v Josh Sparkes>Within that group. That's. Yeah.
I think there's a risk of payments</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/95-1
00:22:34.743 --> 00:22:40.410
<v Josh Sparkes>getting missed out and even in your queue
as an approver, you know, if you see it,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/95-2
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.780
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, but until you assign it to somebody,
we will not pick up.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/96-0
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.076
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
I even like I'm the last resort for this</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/96-1
00:22:49.076 --> 00:22:53.869
<v Josh Sparkes>team and the caches, both of the teams,
because a lot of times even people have</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/96-2
00:22:53.869 --> 00:22:57.644
<v Josh Sparkes>committed, like, yeah, we'll be approving,
they don't approve.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/96-3
00:22:57.644 --> 00:23:01.180
<v Josh Sparkes>So then they will come to me.
So I think you believe that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/97-0
00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:07.466
<v Josh Sparkes>Leave them off guard and I don't think so.
People will be with a lot with a lot of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/97-1
00:23:07.466 --> 00:23:11.906
<v Josh Sparkes>these people. They were finance teams,
managers or related to the finance team.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/97-2
00:23:11.906 --> 00:23:14.958
<v Josh Sparkes>So the reason they're approving is
because of, oh, OK,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/97-3
00:23:14.958 --> 00:23:17.900
<v Josh Sparkes>that outside of finance,
I think outside of finance.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/98-0
00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.335
<v Josh Sparkes>So is there two sides to it then?
So the like the timetable,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/98-1
00:23:22.335 --> 00:23:27.384
<v Josh Sparkes>if you like piece schedule and piece that
is done because we want to make sure we</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/98-2
00:23:27.384 --> 00:23:31.878
<v Josh Sparkes>know annual leave and there's two people
each week to go, yes. So right.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/98-3
00:23:31.878 --> 00:23:36.003
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's one piece of it.
The other pieces at the moment you send</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/98-4
00:23:36.003 --> 00:23:38.220
<v Josh Sparkes>an e-mail to do that to talk people.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/99-0
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.353
<v Josh Sparkes>Do it,
but actually what you could do is like in</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/99-1
00:23:41.353 --> 00:23:45.539
<v Josh Sparkes>the PC and all the people,
all the approvers will sit in an approval</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/99-2
00:23:45.539 --> 00:23:50.453
<v Josh Sparkes>group in the background and you stay in
basically a task to them that then comes</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/99-3
00:23:50.453 --> 00:23:55.065
<v Josh Sparkes>up onto their dashboard and you can
either have a notification off the back</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/99-4
00:23:55.065 --> 00:23:58.220
<v Josh Sparkes>of that because like you see it's non
financing so.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/101-0
00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.799
<v Josh Sparkes>We won't necessarily that in the
dashboard,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/100-0
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:00.420
<v Mark Sedge>Yep.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/101-1
00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:03.695
<v Josh Sparkes>that's where they'll go in and actually
action it.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/101-2
00:24:03.695 --> 00:24:06.592
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's maybe just different ways we
can do it,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/101-3
00:24:06.592 --> 00:24:11.078
<v Josh Sparkes>but I think the timetable and that is
something that's important for the team.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/101-4
00:24:11.078 --> 00:24:13.748
<v Josh Sparkes>We do,
we do maintain unless there's a slicker</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/101-5
00:24:13.748 --> 00:24:16.020
<v Josh Sparkes>way we can do it in service now and all.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/102-0
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.670
<v Josh Sparkes>Should availability markers or something
like that?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/102-1
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.715
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know availability and capacity,
but yeah, I mean,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/102-2
00:24:22.715 --> 00:24:27.072
<v Josh Sparkes>you're probably the fact that you're in
the office suggests that you're available,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/102-3
00:24:27.072 --> 00:24:31.220
<v Josh Sparkes>but you don't. You're showing the load,
aren't you? Is it on a two week cycle?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/103-0
00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:36.144
<v Josh Sparkes>I think more than that, right?
It's like a month that was basically to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/103-1
00:24:36.144 --> 00:24:40.078
<v Josh Sparkes>gauge the availability.
And so that we're not sending it to the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/103-2
00:24:40.078 --> 00:24:43.336
<v Josh Sparkes>same people,
but we have had occasions where so Dave</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/103-3
00:24:43.336 --> 00:24:48.253
<v Josh Sparkes>will send out and create a schedule on
that and then she like kind of splits up</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/103-4
00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:51.020
<v Josh Sparkes>so that it's not the same people,
but if we.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/104-0
00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:55.302
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got specific people in that day
that said that they would be there and we</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/104-1
00:24:55.302 --> 00:24:58.187
<v Josh Sparkes>then go to send them an e-mail to approve
the payments.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/104-2
00:24:58.187 --> 00:25:02.103
<v Josh Sparkes>Then we get out of office from two of
them and they're like, oh, sure what,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/104-3
00:25:02.103 --> 00:25:05.298
<v Josh Sparkes>who do we go today?
Because they were supposed to approve it.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/104-4
00:25:05.298 --> 00:25:09.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Whereas if there was something built into
the system that they could maybe see.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/106-0
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.568
<v Josh Sparkes>That they're going to have the payments
on that week,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/106-1
00:25:13.568 --> 00:25:18.530
<v Josh Sparkes>so that if they aren't going to be there,
they could maybe like as no or daily to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/105-0
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:16.820
<v Mark Sedge>What was?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/106-2
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:23.493
<v Josh Sparkes>some of the ability for out of all that
you know service now has the ability well</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/106-3
00:25:23.493 --> 00:25:26.580
<v Josh Sparkes>it's going to interject now that ability
is there.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/108-0
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:31.502
<v Josh Sparkes>Anyway,
building system without having to create</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/107-0
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.780
<v Mark Sedge>So they can delegate is the point.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/108-1
00:25:31.502 --> 00:25:32.940
<v Josh Sparkes>diary. Yes, yes.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/110-0
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.257
<v Mark Sedge>So if they know they're going to go on
leave,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/110-1
00:25:36.257 --> 00:25:40.268
<v Mark Sedge>they can delegate any approvals to one
one of their colleagues who's going to be</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/110-2
00:25:40.268 --> 00:25:42.497
<v Mark Sedge>around.
And then when they're obviously when</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/110-3
00:25:42.497 --> 00:25:46.260
<v Mark Sedge>they're finished and what have you,
they would then, yeah, we do, you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/110-4
00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.380
<v Mark Sedge>close out that delegation,
but it does rely upon the managers.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/111-0
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:53.518
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, and they the approvers doing that,
which is always tricky.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/111-1
00:25:53.518 --> 00:25:58.275
<v Mark Sedge>The other thing you can do is you can as
an and this is one for an organisation.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/111-2
00:25:58.275 --> 00:26:03.210
<v Mark Sedge>You can think about whether you have your
sort of service level triggers and things</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/111-3
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:07.732
<v Mark Sedge>like that. We have a main approver,
secondary approval you can do that where</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/111-4
00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:09.260
<v Mark Sedge>one so it sends to one of.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/112-0
00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:13.826
<v Mark Sedge>Who and either one of them can do it that
way. You know you've got a bit of a cover.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/112-1
00:26:13.826 --> 00:26:17.144
<v Mark Sedge>You know. There's more.
There's there's various ways of dealing</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/112-2
00:26:17.144 --> 00:26:18.700
<v Mark Sedge>with those critical approvals.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/114-0
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:24.660
<v Josh Sparkes>It's maybe something you just have some
solutions and actually show the guys</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/113-0
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:24.820
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/114-1
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.180
<v Josh Sparkes>because it's very manual, right?
So ideally we really want to do something</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/114-2
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.374
<v Josh Sparkes>a bit slicker and I said creating like
build engine,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/114-3
00:26:32.374 --> 00:26:37.135
<v Josh Sparkes>you do correct scheduling service now.
So it's not the e-mail kind of you know</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/114-4
00:26:37.135 --> 00:26:38.100
<v Josh Sparkes>you're facing a.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/115-0
00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:44.902
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's normally normally to day one.
Yes thing because you can do the manual</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/115-1
00:26:44.902 --> 00:26:50.704
<v Josh Sparkes>piece outside but actually send the tasks.
But maybe I think we need to understand</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/115-2
00:26:50.704 --> 00:26:53.500
<v Josh Sparkes>the solutions of what the system can do.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/116-0
00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.853
<v Josh Sparkes>It's probably worth sheeting what that
process looks like in the emails and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/116-1
00:26:57.853 --> 00:27:00.218
<v Josh Sparkes>stuff,
but we'll catch that so you certainly</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/116-2
00:27:00.218 --> 00:27:04.264
<v Josh Sparkes>could have. I'm not could be fun long,
like we've done in the past where you</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/116-3
00:27:04.264 --> 00:27:07.627
<v Josh Sparkes>have schedules, you know,
and the name person would be approved</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/116-4
00:27:07.627 --> 00:27:11.831
<v Josh Sparkes>based on to this day going to this stage
where you've been assigned to you know</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/116-5
00:27:11.831 --> 00:27:13.460
<v Josh Sparkes>you can capture based on dates.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/118-0
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.946
<v Josh Sparkes>You're still within the approval
assignment group,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/118-1
00:27:16.946 --> 00:27:20.941
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's actually delegating to that
person, so that is possible,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/118-2
00:27:20.941 --> 00:27:25.843
<v Josh Sparkes>and so you're creating effectively what
you call a diary that what we would want</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/118-3
00:27:25.843 --> 00:27:28.870
<v Josh Sparkes>to start schedule that,
that could be a solution.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/118-4
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:30.020
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's a proof.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/117-0
00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:29.940
<v Mark Sedge>I think the sick.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/119-0
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:31.700
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, go mark. Sorry.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/120-0
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:35.678
<v Mark Sedge>No, I was just going to say,
going back to the sort of comment what we</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/120-1
00:27:35.678 --> 00:27:40.072
<v Mark Sedge>need to do is we need to look for the
mechanism that gives you the least amount</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/120-2
00:27:40.072 --> 00:27:42.872
<v Mark Sedge>of overhead,
but approvers take the responsibility</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/120-3
00:27:42.872 --> 00:27:46.112
<v Mark Sedge>because some groups,
some folks will or organisations will</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/120-4
00:27:46.112 --> 00:27:50.780
<v Mark Sedge>have one big group and any member of that
group will get notified that there's a an.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/121-0
00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.757
<v Mark Sedge>Approval waiting for them,
and then whoever's available can go in</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/121-1
00:27:54.757 --> 00:27:59.087
<v Mark Sedge>and and action it so you can do that.
But where you just basically have a pool</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/121-2
00:27:59.087 --> 00:28:03.416
<v Mark Sedge>and whoever's on and able to response to
that alert and then what you can also</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/121-3
00:28:03.416 --> 00:28:07.801
<v Mark Sedge>choose to do depending on that group is
put a service level expectation on that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/121-4
00:28:07.801 --> 00:28:10.980
<v Mark Sedge>group to say you're all approvals need to
be done within.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/122-0
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.209
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
I don't know a day or or whatever. So.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/122-1
00:28:14.209 --> 00:28:18.744
<v Mark Sedge>So there's a number of routes and then
they get flagged up if an approval hasn't.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/122-2
00:28:18.744 --> 00:28:23.112
<v Mark Sedge>And then it enables you to manage it.
You'll see who are doing the bulk of the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/122-3
00:28:23.112 --> 00:28:26.541
<v Mark Sedge>approvals, who are not.
You know you've got a load of metrics</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/122-4
00:28:26.541 --> 00:28:29.140
<v Mark Sedge>then to manage the organisation or
activities.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/123-0
00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.460
<v Mark Sedge>Through data things to think about.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/124-0
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:37.212
<v Josh Sparkes>And the key thing is that ServiceNow
Dashboarding will highlight any</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/124-1
00:28:37.212 --> 00:28:40.883
<v Josh Sparkes>bottlenecks anyway.
So you can reassign and delegate and you</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/124-2
00:28:40.883 --> 00:28:44.314
<v Josh Sparkes>all see it as a,
you know group or the approvers will be</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/124-3
00:28:44.314 --> 00:28:46.180
<v Josh Sparkes>able to reassign that approval.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/125-0
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.380
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you have a similar process in ours?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/126-0
00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:59.963
<v Josh Sparkes>Kind of with pool at the moment we have a
pool of three payment approvers in AP</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/126-1
00:28:59.963 --> 00:29:07.205
<v Josh Sparkes>members. Doing that thing. Yeah,
so it it's kind of. It is kind of similar.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/126-2
00:29:07.205 --> 00:29:11.780
<v Josh Sparkes>We just have a smaller pool of approvers
to go.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/127-0
00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:17.185
<v Josh Sparkes>Go to Australia so it's myself and two of
my colleagues, so we don't.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/127-1
00:29:17.185 --> 00:29:22.663
<v Josh Sparkes>We know that there's a standard primary
secondary approval for cashews.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/127-2
00:29:22.663 --> 00:29:28.977
<v Josh Sparkes>It's standard primary secondary approver
for AP and it doesn't really deviate from</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/127-3
00:29:28.977 --> 00:29:31.260
<v Josh Sparkes>that. So we don't really need.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/128-0
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:37.182
<v Josh Sparkes>Have as much of A need for a diary or
schedule for approvals in Australia right</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/128-1
00:29:37.182 --> 00:29:42.371
<v Josh Sparkes>now and that's what we'll touch upon
tomorrow. Your approval processes. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/128-2
00:29:42.371 --> 00:29:47.561
<v Josh Sparkes>So the cashier's approval process is a
bit more involved in terms of approval</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/128-3
00:29:47.561 --> 00:29:51.220
<v Josh Sparkes>pay for payments for AP.
It's almost exactly the same.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/130-0
00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:56.140
<v Josh Sparkes>As the UK here and as well,
it's still being assigned for an approval.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/130-1
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.069
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, the the,
the the problem is the point of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/130-2
00:29:59.069 --> 00:30:04.227
<v Josh Sparkes>discussion is that also doesn't have that
issue because the actual approvers are</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/130-3
00:30:04.227 --> 00:30:07.220
<v Josh Sparkes>within the same team. Yeah,
whereas over here.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/129-0
00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.140
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/131-0
00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:11.998
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm the only one who can approve the
final class finance. I can.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/131-1
00:30:11.998 --> 00:30:15.992
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm the only one who can approve the
payments within the ask areas.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/131-2
00:30:15.992 --> 00:30:18.460
<v Josh Sparkes>Every other person is outside the finance.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/132-0
00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:24.251
<v Josh Sparkes>So like Jill is asked but not finance,
so she can achieve one of the provers.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/132-1
00:30:24.251 --> 00:30:27.232
<v Josh Sparkes>But say you know a couple of my managers
over here,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/132-2
00:30:27.232 --> 00:30:31.302
<v Josh Sparkes>they are not allowed or team leaders.
They're not allowed. Yeah. Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/132-3
00:30:31.302 --> 00:30:34.570
<v Josh Sparkes>we we just don't have.
Just you're already in Australia.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/132-4
00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:39.041
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm one of the more senior I'm sure
one of the more senior managers in ask</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/132-5
00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:39.500
<v Josh Sparkes>finance.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/133-0
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:44.948
<v Josh Sparkes>So I have to be an approval, but yeah,
we don't have as much of A bottleneck as</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/133-1
00:30:44.948 --> 00:30:48.187
<v Josh Sparkes>the UK do.
So we don't have to think about well,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/133-2
00:30:48.187 --> 00:30:52.881
<v Josh Sparkes>we can implement the same thing,
but it's going to be way more simple.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/133-3
00:30:52.881 --> 00:30:56.516
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just for two people, which, yeah,
you know, yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/133-4
00:30:56.516 --> 00:30:58.500
<v Josh Sparkes>and still have good questions.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/135-0
00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:04.434
<v Josh Sparkes>Answer The assignment group again the
quick question and managed through AD.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/135-1
00:31:04.434 --> 00:31:07.740
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that correct that we set up on the
roles in the?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/136-0
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:10.694
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.
The expectation would be there'll be a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/136-1
00:31:10.694 --> 00:31:14.001
<v Mark Sedge>managed group, as you say.
It'll be controlled,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/136-2
00:31:14.001 --> 00:31:18.479
<v Mark Sedge>access controlled and what have you via
the ID rules, I believe.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/136-3
00:31:18.479 --> 00:31:20.340
<v Mark Sedge>And again we need to check.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/138-0
00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:25.376
<v Mark Sedge>You know how that's, you know,
then formally check that with the AD</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/138-1
00:31:25.376 --> 00:31:28.313
<v Mark Sedge>teams etcetera.
We've got some sessions coming up,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/138-2
00:31:28.313 --> 00:31:31.769
<v Mark Sedge>but principally yes,
it's a managed group and again you can</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/138-3
00:31:31.769 --> 00:31:36.492
<v Mark Sedge>you can do various rules even within that
group in terms of approvals you know to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/138-4
00:31:36.492 --> 00:31:38.220
<v Mark Sedge>make sure you've got coverage.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/139-0
00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.993
<v Mark Sedge>There's various rules and approval groups
you can do it so that yeah, as I say,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/139-1
00:31:42.993 --> 00:31:47.093
<v Mark Sedge>you might have 55 approvers in that group.
Any one of them can pick it up.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/139-2
00:31:47.093 --> 00:31:51.029
<v Mark Sedge>You could have a group to say you need,
you know, if it's more complex,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/139-3
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:53.653
<v Mark Sedge>you might need to delegate approvals.
You know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/139-4
00:31:53.653 --> 00:31:57.862
<v Mark Sedge>22 of that team to review and approve.
Your ServiceNow has the capability to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/139-5
00:31:57.862 --> 00:31:58.300
<v Mark Sedge>arrange.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/141-0
00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:03.159
<v Mark Sedge>Those you just need to go to work out
which which is best for the region and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/140-0
00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:03.020
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/141-1
00:32:03.159 --> 00:32:06.700
<v Mark Sedge>the you know the amount of approvers
you've actually got.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/142-0
00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.348
<v Josh Sparkes>The reason I ask is that it's created
like 3.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/142-1
00:32:10.348 --> 00:32:15.109
<v Josh Sparkes>You know the source of that group resides
in AD and therefore ServiceNow will</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/142-2
00:32:15.109 --> 00:32:20.054
<v Josh Sparkes>inherit and just looking technically here
that will inherit the assignment group</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/142-3
00:32:20.054 --> 00:32:25.060
<v Josh Sparkes>that's been created from AD which can be
populated with non financed individuals.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/144-0
00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.640
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, you can.
You can have any individuals in there</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/143-0
00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:28.540
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/144-1
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:33.052
<v Mark Sedge>because there'll be a stake because
there'll be classified under the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/144-2
00:32:33.052 --> 00:32:36.810
<v Mark Sedge>licencing, I believe as a stakeholder,
parrot will probably need to sort of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/144-3
00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:39.826
<v Mark Sedge>confirm that to me,
but my understanding is there'll be just</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/144-4
00:32:39.826 --> 00:32:43.633
<v Mark Sedge>like an approver stakeholder rather than
somebody who's actively actioning a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/144-5
00:32:43.633 --> 00:32:43.980
<v Mark Sedge>ticket.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/146-0
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:49.649
<v Josh Sparkes>Just indeed, to answer your question,
we managed source which is under Active</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/145-0
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.500
<v Parik Narain>Correct. OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/146-1
00:32:49.649 --> 00:32:52.628
<v Josh Sparkes>Directory.
You had non financial people within that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/146-2
00:32:52.628 --> 00:32:57.441
<v Josh Sparkes>group probably even say and the fact that
then they are within that group gets them</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/146-3
00:32:57.441 --> 00:33:00.134
<v Josh Sparkes>visibility.
You know they've done very good at</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/146-4
00:33:00.134 --> 00:33:02.140
<v Josh Sparkes>segregating its visibility as well.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/147-0
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:07.278
<v Josh Sparkes>So the fact that they only see this
portion as non finance is also a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/147-1
00:33:07.278 --> 00:33:12.772
<v Josh Sparkes>functionality that they're just doing a
very particular part of the process not</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/147-2
00:33:12.772 --> 00:33:14.420
<v Josh Sparkes>seeing everything, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/148-0
00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.802
<v Josh Sparkes>But in essence obvious.
The best way is to showcase that to you.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/148-1
00:33:18.802 --> 00:33:20.860
<v Josh Sparkes>But service now can slightly handle that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/149-0
00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.585
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
So an approval to jump back to approval</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/149-1
00:33:28.585 --> 00:33:32.515
<v Josh Sparkes>approval,
is that the point of request for payment?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/149-2
00:33:32.515 --> 00:33:38.636
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that the stage of which you're it's
gone from new whip new vendor to be added</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/149-3
00:33:38.636 --> 00:33:42.340
<v Josh Sparkes>sub task and that's completed then it
goes into?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/150-0
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:48.227
<v Josh Sparkes>PO non PO rating PO that state and then
moves on to the request for payment and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/150-1
00:33:48.227 --> 00:33:53.217
<v Josh Sparkes>then you've got the approval or is the
approval the bit after that the new after</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/150-2
00:33:53.217 --> 00:33:56.297
<v Josh Sparkes>the PO.
Now once the invoices are in that request</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/150-3
00:33:56.297 --> 00:34:01.224
<v Josh Sparkes>for payments they're ready to actually
batch payments and the approvals come in</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/150-4
00:34:01.224 --> 00:34:02.580
<v Josh Sparkes>to physically approve.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/151-0
00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:07.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Can release the money out of the bank,
so that's the terminology that I use to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/151-1
00:34:07.177 --> 00:34:11.158
<v Josh Sparkes>be using OK as it prefers.
So they're not necessarily approving that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/151-2
00:34:11.158 --> 00:34:14.215
<v Josh Sparkes>the payment can go,
or the batch can go for payment.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/151-3
00:34:14.215 --> 00:34:18.311
<v Josh Sparkes>They're logging into our banking system
to actually release the money,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/151-4
00:34:18.311 --> 00:34:20.100
<v Josh Sparkes>at least approve. OK. Yeah. So.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/152-0
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.940
<v Josh Sparkes>Technically that's.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/153-0
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.635
<v Josh Sparkes>So technically,
the expenses of the disbursements you</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/153-1
00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:35.866
<v Josh Sparkes>know there is a Treasury manager has
spent some money and then which has to be</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/153-2
00:34:35.866 --> 00:34:39.838
<v Josh Sparkes>paid to the vendor.
So the Treasury team member will get an</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/153-3
00:34:39.838 --> 00:34:43.811
<v Josh Sparkes>approval from the Treasury manager and
say hey, by the way,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/153-4
00:34:43.811 --> 00:34:46.460
<v Josh Sparkes>I've made such and such for the team or.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/154-0
00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.925
<v Josh Sparkes>That's why,
he said Treasury manager will then</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/154-1
00:34:49.925 --> 00:34:53.199
<v Josh Sparkes>approve it. So that's kind of like,
you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/154-2
00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:56.900
<v Josh Sparkes>the approval of the payment of approval
of expense.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/155-0
00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.910
<v Josh Sparkes>But not physically sending the payment.
So that's that's basically that, yes,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/155-1
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:07.858
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm approving this. You can do it? Yeah.
When the approval and everything comes to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/155-2
00:35:07.858 --> 00:35:11.733
<v Josh Sparkes>me, I see the evidences.
And in that evidence that that treasury</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/155-3
00:35:11.733 --> 00:35:13.820
<v Josh Sparkes>managers approval should be listed.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/156-0
00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:19.308
<v Josh Sparkes>And my role is not to challenge that at
that stage because I can't be cheques.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/156-1
00:35:19.308 --> 00:35:22.239
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
but I my responsibility is to check that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/156-2
00:35:22.239 --> 00:35:26.980
<v Josh Sparkes>yes, the approval is there or not.
And then I go on with the actual banking</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/156-3
00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.850
<v Josh Sparkes>portal and approve and then approve that.
OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/156-4
00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:33.780
<v Josh Sparkes>So I was thinking you'll effectively
request a payment within.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/157-0
00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:38.174
<v Josh Sparkes>And jump into waiting approval.
But what it is is requested payment and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/157-1
00:35:38.174 --> 00:35:41.171
<v Josh Sparkes>then approval end up completed
effectively. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/157-2
00:35:41.171 --> 00:35:46.264
<v Josh Sparkes>And then at that point I'm close complete.
Are you clean? You're basically approved.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/157-3
00:35:46.264 --> 00:35:49.980
<v Josh Sparkes>Close complete. Yeah.
So all that cheques and balances. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/158-0
00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.958
<v Josh Sparkes>Anything that needs to be compliant,
anything that needs to be checked,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/158-1
00:35:54.958 --> 00:35:59.213
<v Josh Sparkes>anything that needs to be approved,
everything has been done so that once it</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/158-2
00:35:59.213 --> 00:36:02.473
<v Josh Sparkes>gets to that point of the payment,
we'll say the approval,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/158-3
00:36:02.473 --> 00:36:07.060
<v Josh Sparkes>it is just approving the money to go out
of the bank and then it's done. Yeah, so.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/159-0
00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:12.389
<v Josh Sparkes>You don't even have to say it is closed.
Complete well approved, closed, complete.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/159-1
00:36:12.389 --> 00:36:13.860
<v Josh Sparkes>Essentially. OK, that's good.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/160-0
00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:20.608
<v Josh Sparkes>And would you capture the fact that it's
been assigned to you as the approver?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/160-1
00:36:20.608 --> 00:36:23.775
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you want to change?
That's the supporting evidence,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/160-2
00:36:23.775 --> 00:36:28.151
<v Josh Sparkes>there's no supporting evidence that you
need from that just smiling because</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/160-3
00:36:28.151 --> 00:36:32.700
<v Josh Sparkes>actually you got a message that you
approved through payments. I have example.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/161-0
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.893
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
be there is upstairs if you want like</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/161-1
00:36:39.893 --> 00:36:46.363
<v Josh Sparkes>that. Is it confidential to see? Yeah,
maybe. Yeah. It's not mentioned.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/161-2
00:36:46.363 --> 00:36:50.945
<v Josh Sparkes>What client or what vendor. That. Yeah,
it can be.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/161-3
00:36:50.945 --> 00:36:54.540
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe not to create your response issue.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/162-0
00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:59.679
<v Josh Sparkes>Because is there any reason?
I mean that sounds a happy part,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/162-1
00:36:59.679 --> 00:37:03.663
<v Josh Sparkes>so we're suggesting that balance women
cheques requested,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/162-2
00:37:03.663 --> 00:37:09.364
<v Josh Sparkes>is there anything that then come back if
there was another part of it might not go</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/162-3
00:37:09.364 --> 00:37:11.700
<v Josh Sparkes>through or it's just another step?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/163-0
00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:16.211
<v Josh Sparkes>Occasion like on the occasion as one of
the approvals in Australia,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/163-1
00:37:16.211 --> 00:37:20.848
<v Josh Sparkes>I am one of the last line of defences,
so if I have any questions or if I have</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/163-2
00:37:20.848 --> 00:37:23.490
<v Josh Sparkes>concerns about what's going out for
payment,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/163-3
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:28.068
<v Josh Sparkes>I can go back and ask questions like I
won't approve like I won't release the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/163-4
00:37:28.068 --> 00:37:32.060
<v Josh Sparkes>payment until I'm 100% comfortable that
I've got all the paperwork.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/164-0
00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:38.001
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't need to review that one of the
payments a payment since the times that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/164-1
00:37:38.001 --> 00:37:44.012
<v Josh Sparkes>an incorrect invoice has been picked up
in a batch payment that should be picked</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/164-2
00:37:44.012 --> 00:37:46.980
<v Josh Sparkes>up, and I can tell that of the supplier.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/165-0
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.221
<v Josh Sparkes>Name. Basically. Sure,
it just means we've been classified</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/165-1
00:37:51.221 --> 00:37:56.549
<v Josh Sparkes>incorrectly at our end or someone flagged
me last week that there was an invoice</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/165-2
00:37:56.549 --> 00:38:00.825
<v Josh Sparkes>that had been included for the payment
that shouldn't have been.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/165-3
00:38:00.825 --> 00:38:06.220
<v Josh Sparkes>So I picked it up at that point and just
you just go back to the team and ask so.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/166-0
00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:11.191
<v Josh Sparkes>Should you pick that one up?
Which states or as the paperwork has come</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/166-1
00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:14.484
<v Josh Sparkes>to me. Right. OK,
I'll need a review before I actually</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/166-2
00:38:14.484 --> 00:38:18.615
<v Josh Sparkes>approve the payments. Yeah.
So it's at that point that we would kind</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/166-3
00:38:18.615 --> 00:38:22.507
<v Josh Sparkes>of go back in question.
So no sandeep's done the same would have</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/166-4
00:38:22.507 --> 00:38:26.100
<v Josh Sparkes>done the same thing.
And is it the same point in time that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/167-0
00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.271
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
Why don't we get the we have our own</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/167-1
00:38:29.271 --> 00:38:33.507
<v Josh Sparkes>cheques and balances of the paperwork
that we will do just to make sure that we</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/167-2
00:38:33.507 --> 00:38:37.796
<v Josh Sparkes>are 100% comfortable that the money's.
So you could potentially put that on hold</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/167-3
00:38:37.796 --> 00:38:41.291
<v Josh Sparkes>or pending at that point.
Do you do those additional again? Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/167-4
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:43.780
<v Josh Sparkes>your dashboards,
you've got an ageing tickets.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/168-0
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:48.546
<v Josh Sparkes>On request for payments that you might
have to do some balances and cheques or</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/168-1
00:38:48.546 --> 00:38:52.035
<v Josh Sparkes>rectify before you approve those complete.
Potentially. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/168-2
00:38:52.035 --> 00:38:56.031
<v Josh Sparkes>It can happen for much time.
Option I think you will see tomorrow in a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/168-3
00:38:56.031 --> 00:39:00.646
<v Josh Sparkes>better way like you know because that's
the cashing and they're the ones you know</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/168-4
00:39:00.646 --> 00:39:03.460
<v Josh Sparkes>work through and processing the payments
and all.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/169-0
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.380
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/170-0
00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.090
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, the, I mean,
the evidence and everything, I mean,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/170-1
00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:11.380
<v Josh Sparkes>we we won't hold it or we won't,
you know like.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/171-0
00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:16.569
<v Josh Sparkes>Send an e-mail straight away or anything.
I mean, we will ask.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/171-1
00:39:16.569 --> 00:39:19.336
<v Josh Sparkes>We will ask the person immediately that
what's wrong,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/171-2
00:39:19.336 --> 00:39:23.539
<v Josh Sparkes>because we want to release that payment
out as soon as possible because say in my</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/171-3
00:39:23.539 --> 00:39:25.897
<v Josh Sparkes>example of the training manager has
approved,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/171-4
00:39:25.897 --> 00:39:30.100
<v Josh Sparkes>he's expecting that to go out straight
away or go out by 5:00, cut off basically.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/172-0
00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.310
<v Josh Sparkes>So if I'm holding it up because of XYZ
reason, it's not going to work out,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/172-1
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:37.319
<v Josh Sparkes>so it's not acceptable either threat
because you have to.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/172-2
00:39:37.319 --> 00:39:40.068
<v Josh Sparkes>We try if I'm not comfortable then you
know we will,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/172-3
00:39:40.068 --> 00:39:44.321
<v Josh Sparkes>we will ask the questions and and one of
the reason one of the key aspect is that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/172-4
00:39:44.321 --> 00:39:46.759
<v Josh Sparkes>again we'll cover it to more and more
details.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/172-5
00:39:46.759 --> 00:39:49.820
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a payment form for some of the
payments which has.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/173-0
00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:54.307
<v Josh Sparkes>Very detailed and very kind of like in
minute information of what exactly we</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/173-1
00:39:54.307 --> 00:39:57.173
<v Josh Sparkes>should be checking like currencies and
bank accounts,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/173-2
00:39:57.173 --> 00:40:01.314
<v Josh Sparkes>which is coming through and all and the
caches would have checked whether the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/173-3
00:40:01.314 --> 00:40:05.454
<v Josh Sparkes>particular bank account has money or not.
The account has money or not before</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/173-4
00:40:05.454 --> 00:40:09.382
<v Josh Sparkes>they're processing the purchase.
All those ticks and all those tick boxes</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/173-5
00:40:09.382 --> 00:40:09.860
<v Josh Sparkes>are done.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/174-0
00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:13.220
<v Josh Sparkes>Already for us.
But we I will still go back and I will</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/174-1
00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:18.170
<v Josh Sparkes>still check that whatever is put on the
form is reflecting on the e-mail as well,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/174-2
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:21.068
<v Josh Sparkes>for example.
But I think the question is on the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/174-3
00:40:21.068 --> 00:40:24.750
<v Josh Sparkes>payment file approval.
I think that's very different because</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/174-4
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:29.580
<v Josh Sparkes>payment file is like you know by process
by Lorna and which will have like say.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/175-0
00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:33.748
<v Josh Sparkes>106 hundred payment transactions and
payments to be made out.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/175-1
00:40:33.748 --> 00:40:37.782
<v Josh Sparkes>I can't check all of those,
so I have to kind of like, you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/175-2
00:40:37.782 --> 00:40:40.762
<v Josh Sparkes>trust.
What has been reported in that report by</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/175-3
00:40:40.762 --> 00:40:44.238
<v Josh Sparkes>three East and process a female like all
of that? Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/175-4
00:40:44.238 --> 00:40:47.900
<v Josh Sparkes>Not only not on in international pieces.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/176-0
00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:51.639
<v Josh Sparkes>I think, yeah,
payments would only be unfolded, right?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/176-1
00:40:51.639 --> 00:40:55.712
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know. An hour, 20 minutes.
Because incorrect reference.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/176-2
00:40:55.712 --> 00:41:00.293
<v Josh Sparkes>You might have a drop. You know,
between that state there might be some</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/176-3
00:41:00.293 --> 00:41:03.347
<v Josh Sparkes>fields available to you that you could
capture.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/176-4
00:41:03.347 --> 00:41:07.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Usually you're not putting it on hold,
but before you close it.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/178-0
00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:11.072
<v Josh Sparkes>Correct record.
You could capture some insight that's</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/178-1
00:41:11.072 --> 00:41:15.390
<v Josh Sparkes>very important as an approval.
I won't touch that the bit between</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/178-2
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:20.101
<v Josh Sparkes>request that you could do some just
questioning is that double handling</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/178-3
00:41:20.101 --> 00:41:22.980
<v Josh Sparkes>because I'd have to send an e-mail back
or.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/179-0
00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:27.478
<v Josh Sparkes>Call up or some kind of communication to
my team member to say this is incorrect</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/179-1
00:41:27.478 --> 00:41:30.053
<v Josh Sparkes>and all the payment references missing a
number.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/179-2
00:41:30.053 --> 00:41:32.366
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you fix that up and then I can
approve.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/179-3
00:41:32.366 --> 00:41:35.415
<v Josh Sparkes>And then I'm waiting for an e-mail for
them to come back.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/179-4
00:41:35.415 --> 00:41:39.463
<v Josh Sparkes>So am I going to be double handling and
then just communicate today and then</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/179-5
00:41:39.463 --> 00:41:40.620
<v Josh Sparkes>update something else?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/180-0
00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.957
<v Josh Sparkes>Rather than you're adding like a note to
it, you might do that,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/180-1
00:41:44.957 --> 00:41:49.494
<v Josh Sparkes>but you're still processing it and not
sending undue emails or anything.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/180-2
00:41:49.494 --> 00:41:52.913
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just maybe capturing and at the end
of the month,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/180-3
00:41:52.913 --> 00:41:56.580
<v Josh Sparkes>say actually we had 98% happy path and we
had 2% that had.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/181-0
00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:01.484
<v Josh Sparkes>Some information just to I mean.
Thank you. I think I think we are.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/181-1
00:42:01.484 --> 00:42:05.669
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't think we are kind of like
diverting from the AP process and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/181-2
00:42:05.669 --> 00:42:09.730
<v Josh Sparkes>capturing process completely.
Now to answer answer your question,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/181-3
00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.700
<v Josh Sparkes>I would process that payment OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/182-0
00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:16.251
<v Josh Sparkes>I would if if I if there's an issue in
the form which I know is a minor error,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/182-1
00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:19.446
<v Josh Sparkes>sometimes the partner would say something
and give something,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/182-2
00:42:19.446 --> 00:42:23.774
<v Josh Sparkes>but we know that OK e-mail and everything
we have done that but with time construct</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/182-3
00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:27.382
<v Josh Sparkes>we will approve that payment.
But what I would be doing is I would be</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/182-4
00:42:27.382 --> 00:42:31.659
<v Josh Sparkes>asking the individual who has sent me the
payment like from my team to go and have</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/182-5
00:42:31.659 --> 00:42:32.020
<v Josh Sparkes>a file.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/183-0
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:36.619
<v Josh Sparkes>We are not booked with the partner or
whoever has passed the payment and say</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/183-1
00:42:36.619 --> 00:42:39.789
<v Josh Sparkes>that, hey, by the way,
you have given me say dollars,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/183-2
00:42:39.789 --> 00:42:43.253
<v Josh Sparkes>but this is GBP sure.
So we have posted in GBP as you have</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/183-3
00:42:43.253 --> 00:42:45.953
<v Josh Sparkes>mentioned,
you're OK with that and then we'll</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/183-4
00:42:45.953 --> 00:42:50.355
<v Josh Sparkes>confirm back and we'll go buy more of
that purely from an external logging</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/183-5
00:42:50.355 --> 00:42:51.060
<v Josh Sparkes>perspective.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/184-0
00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:56.246
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, the time constraints. It's just,
yeah, OK,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/184-1
00:42:56.246 --> 00:42:59.753
<v Josh Sparkes>because by the time apart from the
payment file,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/184-2
00:42:59.753 --> 00:43:04.906
<v Josh Sparkes>I think everything else is like when it
comes to my desk for the final,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/184-3
00:43:04.906 --> 00:43:07.340
<v Josh Sparkes>I still have my total cheques and.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/185-0
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:12.160
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's it's not about Constipation.
It's not about holding it. You know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/185-1
00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:16.640
<v Josh Sparkes>like we we really want to. That's it.
We really want to make the payment as</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/185-2
00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:21.355
<v Josh Sparkes>soon as possible and for all that is,
it's that because there's different types</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/185-3
00:43:21.355 --> 00:43:24.538
<v Josh Sparkes>of payments.
So an annual payment like Sandeep saying</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/185-4
00:43:24.538 --> 00:43:26.660
<v Josh Sparkes>that he will get like the the forum.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/186-0
00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.966
<v Josh Sparkes>The invoice and the approval,
and he needs to make sure that matches.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/186-1
00:43:30.966 --> 00:43:34.190
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't get that for when we're doing
actual payment run.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/186-2
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:38.071
<v Josh Sparkes>That's an electronic file and we've got
approvers that are in finance.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/186-3
00:43:38.071 --> 00:43:42.170
<v Josh Sparkes>So they maybe particularly don't know
that well that being there should be</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/186-4
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.793
<v Josh Sparkes>getting paid at that time and things like
that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/186-5
00:43:44.793 --> 00:43:46.980
<v Josh Sparkes>So when we are running the payment runs.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/187-0
00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:47.500
<v Josh Sparkes>We are.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/188-0
00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:50.635
<v Josh Sparkes>We're looking out for also,
and so told me have not to pay that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/188-1
00:43:50.635 --> 00:43:54.301
<v Josh Sparkes>So what we would try and put that one
hold so that it wouldn't pull into the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/188-2
00:43:54.301 --> 00:43:56.872
<v Josh Sparkes>payment done.
And then when we are doing our cheques,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/188-3
00:43:56.872 --> 00:44:00.634
<v Josh Sparkes>we've got like specific veins there's
that we know we should only be paying at</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/188-4
00:44:00.634 --> 00:44:03.586
<v Josh Sparkes>certain times a month.
So we're capturing that when we do our</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/188-5
00:44:03.586 --> 00:44:07.300
<v Josh Sparkes>cheques and actually when we run the
payment run when it then goes to the EP.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/189-0
00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:11.043
<v Josh Sparkes>Supervisor.
They're been doing cheques or and above</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/189-1
00:44:11.043 --> 00:44:15.751
<v Josh Sparkes>that first invoices over certain amounts,
making sure that there's not any</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/189-2
00:44:15.751 --> 00:44:20.772
<v Josh Sparkes>duplicate invoices and things like that.
So that anytime it gets to that proof,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/189-3
00:44:20.772 --> 00:44:25.793
<v Josh Sparkes>relatives of duplication of working and
making sure that sort of thing ties up.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/189-4
00:44:25.793 --> 00:44:27.300
<v Josh Sparkes>Because as I said, some.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/190-0
00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:32.047
<v Josh Sparkes>And maybe in the finance department.
So they maybe particularly don't know</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/190-1
00:44:32.047 --> 00:44:34.746
<v Josh Sparkes>what well,
we shouldn't be paying that so they</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/190-2
00:44:34.746 --> 00:44:38.882
<v Josh Sparkes>wouldn't hold that up because they
wouldn't know that that makes sense.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/190-3
00:44:38.882 --> 00:44:42.155
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's good.
I'm doing the supervisor process and the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/190-4
00:44:42.155 --> 00:44:46.980
<v Josh Sparkes>payment approval process at the same time.
Yeah. So we don't have that second chip.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/191-0
00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:51.001
<v Josh Sparkes>That the UK do because my team's a little
bit smaller,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/191-1
00:44:51.001 --> 00:44:56.161
<v Josh Sparkes>but because I have the ability to approve
the payments that I do both at the same</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/191-2
00:44:56.161 --> 00:44:58.804
<v Josh Sparkes>time.
So that's probably where my rate of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/191-3
00:44:58.804 --> 00:45:03.839
<v Josh Sparkes>potentially holding up or being able to
point figure out or pinpoint any errors</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/191-4
00:45:03.839 --> 00:45:06.860
<v Josh Sparkes>or things that should be get getting
picked up.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/192-0
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:14.220
<v Josh Sparkes>Up happens more often than it would be
same day because I'm doing both OK,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/192-1
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:22.188
<v Josh Sparkes>so that's probably where the difference
is. That's good. OK, so maybe there's the.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/192-2
00:45:22.188 --> 00:45:24.780
<v Josh Sparkes>As said, the approval bits.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/193-0
00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:29.716
<v Josh Sparkes>During process for the managing invoices
or the payment for invoices,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/193-1
00:45:29.716 --> 00:45:33.216
<v Josh Sparkes>you said over a certain amount.
So with that over 10,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/193-2
00:45:33.216 --> 00:45:38.011
<v Josh Sparkes>000 under that I mean what are the
thresholds that you need an additional</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/193-3
00:45:38.011 --> 00:45:41.900
<v Josh Sparkes>approval maybe the difference between the
UK and Australia?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/194-0
00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:45.572
<v Josh Sparkes>We sorry,
we just need to approve us to we have an</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/194-1
00:45:45.572 --> 00:45:49.662
<v Josh Sparkes>initial approval and then a release out
of the bank and that's it.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/194-2
00:45:49.662 --> 00:45:54.850
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't have thresholds because we don't
have the pool of approvers that the UK do.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/194-3
00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:57.780
<v Josh Sparkes>So we just don't open to the is there
anything.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/195-0
00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:06.036
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, same.
It's just washed and say to approve that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/195-1
00:46:06.036 --> 00:46:11.379
<v Josh Sparkes>and someone to check the payments. I mean,
someone to the England listing. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/195-2
00:46:11.379 --> 00:46:15.337
<v Josh Sparkes>So no thresholds. No. Yeah.
It it also depends on the bank.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/195-3
00:46:15.337 --> 00:46:17.580
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've got two banking partners.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/196-0
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:22.306
<v Josh Sparkes>So one of them,
it's like straight away first and second</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/196-1
00:46:22.306 --> 00:46:27.373
<v Josh Sparkes>approval on the second Bang,
it's more detailed like this different</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/196-2
00:46:27.373 --> 00:46:31.620
<v Josh Sparkes>kind of you know like what do you call
combinations and.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/197-0
00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:39.409
<v Josh Sparkes>Kind of rule and then amount plus,
you know title and amount.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/197-1
00:46:39.409 --> 00:46:44.403
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's a little bit of more control
and manoeuvring around who and how they</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/197-2
00:46:44.403 --> 00:46:47.898
<v Josh Sparkes>can make the the payment.
But then from AB perspective,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/197-3
00:46:47.898 --> 00:46:51.705
<v Josh Sparkes>we have kept it static,
I mean from cashiers and from client</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/197-4
00:46:51.705 --> 00:46:54.140
<v Josh Sparkes>payments perspective that is different.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/198-0
00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:57.500
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/199-0
00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:03.818
<v Josh Sparkes>I just quickly check and that was a lot
in there.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/199-1
00:47:03.818 --> 00:47:06.827
<v Josh Sparkes>So from managing your voice to the
managing payment,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/199-2
00:47:06.827 --> 00:47:11.369
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you've covered quite a lot of end
to end in that whole process. I mean,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/199-3
00:47:11.369 --> 00:47:15.967
<v Josh Sparkes>you're doing a lot of the, the actual,
I mean all the actual work is outside the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/199-4
00:47:15.967 --> 00:47:19.260
<v Josh Sparkes>service Now this is just managing the
task. So we've got.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/200-0
00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:24.425
<v Josh Sparkes>The ingestion of the invoice,
whether you know about it or not,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/200-1
00:47:24.425 --> 00:47:28.379
<v Josh Sparkes>that vendor.
So we've got sub workflow back to you to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/200-2
00:47:28.379 --> 00:47:31.966
<v Josh Sparkes>create that vend details and checklist
etcetera.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/200-3
00:47:31.966 --> 00:47:35.700
<v Josh Sparkes>And then you have the processing of non
PO and PO.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/201-0
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:40.407
<v Josh Sparkes>They're awaiting APO,
but it then moves into request for</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/201-1
00:47:40.407 --> 00:47:43.697
<v Josh Sparkes>payment,
and then that close approved completes.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/201-2
00:47:43.697 --> 00:47:45.980
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that probably I know that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/202-0
00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:51.370
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a lot of,
I think it's a lot of processes on there,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/202-1
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:55.072
<v Josh Sparkes>but we've captured, you know,
the differences in the locations,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/202-2
00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:59.237
<v Josh Sparkes>but that's sort of your end to end and
your captions simplified it from</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/202-3
00:47:59.237 --> 00:48:02.997
<v Josh Sparkes>receiving to managing,
managing vendor and then the managing the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/202-4
00:48:02.997 --> 00:48:03.460
<v Josh Sparkes>payment.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/203-0
00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:09.060
<v Josh Sparkes>You see,
if someone in the business sends an</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/203-1
00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:14.750
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice over and request the payment and
it was through all the workflow so they</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/203-2
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:19.807
<v Josh Sparkes>then get a notification when it's fully
processed and awaiting payment.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/203-3
00:48:19.807 --> 00:48:23.460
<v Josh Sparkes>Or do they get a touch point of every
time someone?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/204-0
00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:28.087
<v Josh Sparkes>That was to say,
if we get a ticket and and the assignor,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/204-1
00:48:28.087 --> 00:48:34.008
<v Josh Sparkes>then the person who's raised the request
get an automatic reply and at various</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/204-2
00:48:34.008 --> 00:48:39.180
<v Josh Sparkes>touch points within that workflow they
get an automatic reply which.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/205-0
00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:43.421
<v Josh Sparkes>Can can be frustrating if you're letting
all these definite touch points,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/205-1
00:48:43.421 --> 00:48:46.308
<v Josh Sparkes>and definitely there's a white noise
after a while. I mean,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/205-2
00:48:46.308 --> 00:48:48.762
<v Josh Sparkes>if you do an invoice and you always want
to, well,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/205-3
00:48:48.762 --> 00:48:52.516
<v Josh Sparkes>you probably get lots of questions on the
back of invoices. Have you paid it?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/205-4
00:48:52.516 --> 00:48:55.500
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it paid when you're paying it?
Is it done? It's, you know.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/206-0
00:48:55.980 --> 00:49:00.439
<v Josh Sparkes>That so if you could reduce that traffic
coming back to you,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/206-1
00:49:00.439 --> 00:49:04.460
<v Josh Sparkes>but they're also up to date on that,
so it's probably.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/207-0
00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:09.613
<v Josh Sparkes>So they want to just know when it's they
want to know when it's done,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/207-1
00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:12.265
<v Josh Sparkes>so they are the requester on the original
portal.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/207-2
00:49:12.265 --> 00:49:16.191
<v Josh Sparkes>I think Jill's probably going to talk
about notifications as 1000 things.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/207-3
00:49:16.191 --> 00:49:20.116
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just going to see if you can talk
through what it looks like from the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/207-4
00:49:20.116 --> 00:49:24.360
<v Josh Sparkes>employee side and you see how they work
full stages and there they can just see</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/207-5
00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.580
<v Josh Sparkes>it second through that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/208-0
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:30.485
<v Josh Sparkes>So they told necessarily are not prompted,
but if they go in and look for their case,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/208-1
00:49:30.485 --> 00:49:35.087
<v Josh Sparkes>they get that visibility and visibility
of where that is on that the idea is that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/208-2
00:49:35.087 --> 00:49:39.463
<v Josh Sparkes>they will the backup individual since
they will also be able to check whether</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/208-3
00:49:39.463 --> 00:49:42.886
<v Josh Sparkes>that is paid and completed.
So they will have an access as a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/208-4
00:49:42.886 --> 00:49:45.580
<v Josh Sparkes>requester. Yeah.
Do you use the IT portal just.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/209-0
00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.436
<v Josh Sparkes>And it was then they used it.
So you can go in and actually,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/209-1
00:49:48.436 --> 00:49:51.804
<v Josh Sparkes>instead of reading an e-mail to IT,
you can put it in through the portal.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/209-2
00:49:51.804 --> 00:49:54.489
<v Josh Sparkes>And when you raise an e-mail or put it
through the portal,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/209-3
00:49:54.489 --> 00:49:57.993
<v Josh Sparkes>you can actually go into the portal and
it'll tell you who it's assigning to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/209-4
00:49:57.993 --> 00:50:01.816
<v Josh Sparkes>where it is and if they've got a question,
they can ask you questions through that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/209-5
00:50:01.816 --> 00:50:04.820
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's how this workspace will work.
So if you're a requester.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/210-0
00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:09.001
<v Josh Sparkes>You can go in and there'll be a part on
it that shows you all the old seconds</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/210-1
00:50:09.001 --> 00:50:11.535
<v Josh Sparkes>that you've raised.
You can go back into that ticket,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/210-2
00:50:11.535 --> 00:50:13.460
<v Josh Sparkes>you can see where it's sitting and stuff.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/211-0
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:16.580
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/213-0
00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:21.373
<v Mark Sedge>And what we what we do on that as part of
sort of the broader user communications</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/212-0
00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:19.020
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/213-1
00:50:21.373 --> 00:50:26.161
<v Mark Sedge>etcetera is we will showcase that to them
to actually enable them to go there first</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/213-2
00:50:26.161 --> 00:50:30.322
<v Mark Sedge>before chasing and what have you and
that'll be through any records that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/213-3
00:50:30.322 --> 00:50:32.260
<v Mark Sedge>they've raised through the portal.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/214-0
00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:39.758
<v Josh Sparkes>What? I, sorry.
What I was thinking was if we then close</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/214-1
00:50:39.758 --> 00:50:40.940
<v Josh Sparkes>it when it's.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/215-0
00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:46.109
<v Josh Sparkes>So you're going to close.
That's we apply personal leads.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/215-1
00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:51.206
<v Josh Sparkes>So once it's made for payment with the
once you've approved it and I'll send you</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/215-2
00:50:51.206 --> 00:50:53.660
<v Josh Sparkes>an e-mail saying all payments approved.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/216-0
00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:54.140
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/217-0
00:50:55.340 --> 00:51:00.373
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep, on that. And so we get an invoice,
then that they're asking for an immediate</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/217-1
00:51:00.373 --> 00:51:04.179
<v Josh Sparkes>payment. Yep. Sure.
And then they'll get a notification once.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/217-2
00:51:04.179 --> 00:51:07.678
<v Josh Sparkes>That's right through. Well,
then go to the, as Joe said,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/217-3
00:51:07.678 --> 00:51:11.054
<v Josh Sparkes>the dashboard.
They'll see each of the activity states</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/217-4
00:51:11.054 --> 00:51:14.553
<v Josh Sparkes>where it's at.
So how do we manage the invoices that are</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/217-5
00:51:14.553 --> 00:51:14.860
<v Josh Sparkes>just?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/219-0
00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:20.179
<v Josh Sparkes>The general like 30 days on account where
we because I think the notifications or</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/219-1
00:51:20.179 --> 00:51:25.163
<v Josh Sparkes>immediate payments or urgent quick
turnarounds is going to be really helpful.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/219-2
00:51:25.163 --> 00:51:29.061
<v Josh Sparkes>But if it that's the smaller group of
what our invoices are,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/219-3
00:51:29.061 --> 00:51:34.045
<v Josh Sparkes>they think we're processing an invoice
today that's not due until the 30th of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/219-4
00:51:34.045 --> 00:51:34.620
<v Josh Sparkes>November.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/220-0
00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:37.209
<v Josh Sparkes>November.
I don't really want to hang want it</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/220-1
00:51:37.209 --> 00:51:40.860
<v Josh Sparkes>hanging around my dashboard until the
payments been released, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/221-0
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:46.213
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes. Yeah, it's part one.
So if it's coming to the proper request,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/221-1
00:51:46.213 --> 00:51:49.658
<v Josh Sparkes>which is a small,
they can see that updated state on their</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/221-2
00:51:49.658 --> 00:51:53.046
<v Josh Sparkes>on their workload.
And so they've been notified that they</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/221-3
00:51:53.046 --> 00:51:57.484
<v Josh Sparkes>won't get emails that will be the
advanced understanding place that they go</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/221-4
00:51:57.484 --> 00:51:57.660
<v Josh Sparkes>to.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/222-0
00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:02.634
<v Josh Sparkes>But you're saying for the ones that are
recurring that needs to be paid? Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/222-1
00:52:02.634 --> 00:52:06.288
<v Josh Sparkes>like it'll be the majority about invoices.
Like we'll get in,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/222-2
00:52:06.288 --> 00:52:10.177
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll process them and I'll go through
the workflow of, you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/222-3
00:52:10.177 --> 00:52:13.712
<v Josh Sparkes>the completed ready for payment status
that we spoke about.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/222-4
00:52:13.712 --> 00:52:17.660
<v Josh Sparkes>But they're not going to get picked up
for payment for another 30.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/223-0
00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:18.540
<v Josh Sparkes>Three days, but.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/224-0
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:21.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Any chance?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/225-0
00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.330
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
that's the payment times means to him to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/225-1
00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:25.900
<v Josh Sparkes>pay within 30.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/226-0
00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:30.436
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
it could also be on account plus one like</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/226-1
00:52:30.436 --> 00:52:32.740
<v Josh Sparkes>in two days. What's the 31 would be just.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/227-0
00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:36.180
<v Josh Sparkes>Because we're paying within our ventures.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/228-0
00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:44.598
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So you need,
you need to be notified. So based on that,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/228-1
00:52:44.598 --> 00:52:48.177
<v Josh Sparkes>so these are regular things each month.
It's a bulk of, yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/228-2
00:52:48.177 --> 00:52:52.968
<v Josh Sparkes>I think what we're trying to put one and
I kind of trying to understand is at what</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/228-3
00:52:52.968 --> 00:52:57.067
<v Josh Sparkes>point does someone get notified?
Because if we're going to notify them</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/228-4
00:52:57.067 --> 00:52:59.780
<v Josh Sparkes>that your invoice has been processed and
it's.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/229-0
00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:04.110
<v Josh Sparkes>Ready for payment?
That's essentially what our resolved as</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/229-1
00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:08.200
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail notification is right now,
but we're not right now.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/229-2
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:13.468
<v Josh Sparkes>We're not communicating out to the
business when the invoice gets picked up</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/229-3
00:53:13.468 --> 00:53:17.420
<v Josh Sparkes>for payment because we can't physically
tell 500 people.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/230-0
00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:22.056
<v Josh Sparkes>When we're processing 500 invoices in our
batch payment, yeah, I think so.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/230-1
00:53:22.056 --> 00:53:25.016
<v Josh Sparkes>I think this,
that's where we're a bit lost in at what</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/230-2
00:53:25.016 --> 00:53:28.730
<v Josh Sparkes>point like for the you know,
for those quick turnarounds where we've</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/230-3
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:32.121
<v Josh Sparkes>picked up the invoice,
we're saying it's ready for payment and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/230-4
00:53:32.121 --> 00:53:35.457
<v Josh Sparkes>we're paying it today.
We're paying it tomorrow. That's cool.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/230-5
00:53:35.457 --> 00:53:37.180
<v Josh Sparkes>But the majority about invoices.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/231-0
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.430
<v Josh Sparkes>We're going to get picked up.
It's part of a batch.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/231-1
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:43.473
<v Josh Sparkes>It's part of a batch payment.
As out there, you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/231-2
00:53:43.473 --> 00:53:47.756
<v Josh Sparkes>with their regular payment terms.
So are we saying that we're going to keep</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/231-3
00:53:47.756 --> 00:53:52.433
<v Josh Sparkes>those cases or those tickets around until
the approver actually clicks approved to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/231-4
00:53:52.433 --> 00:53:56.660
<v Josh Sparkes>release the money out of the bank for
payment of those invoices? And then?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/232-0
00:53:56.740 --> 00:54:01.244
<v Josh Sparkes>And we have to update that in service now
to trigger that notification to say, OK,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/232-1
00:54:01.244 --> 00:54:05.205
<v Josh Sparkes>your invoice has now been paid,
which has been 60 days since you gave us</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/232-2
00:54:05.205 --> 00:54:08.027
<v Josh Sparkes>the invoice.
Maybe I can roll back that what you do</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/232-3
00:54:08.027 --> 00:54:12.206
<v Josh Sparkes>today. So you have all the batches,
how do you communicate with any other we</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/232-4
00:54:12.206 --> 00:54:13.780
<v Josh Sparkes>stay and then you get chased?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/233-0
00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:17.629
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that no, we only get chased.
The things that are urgent.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/233-1
00:54:17.629 --> 00:54:21.853
<v Josh Sparkes>So if somewhat like I think the events
team is probably a really good example</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/233-2
00:54:21.853 --> 00:54:26.077
<v Josh Sparkes>because they often get invoices now and
they're due in three days or they get</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/233-3
00:54:26.077 --> 00:54:30.517
<v Josh Sparkes>invoices now and by the time they get the
relevant approvals and coding that they</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/233-4
00:54:30.517 --> 00:54:31.980
<v Josh Sparkes>need, it was due yesterday.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/235-0
00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:37.300
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's a bit more pressure from them
and they're getting chased from a vendor.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/235-1
00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.929
<v Josh Sparkes>They're the ones that generally chasing
us.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/235-2
00:54:39.929 --> 00:54:43.455
<v Josh Sparkes>If IT is sending us an invoice for a
monthly subscription,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/235-3
00:54:43.455 --> 00:54:47.698
<v Josh Sparkes>they're not chasing us for payment.
They know that if they send us the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/235-4
00:54:47.698 --> 00:54:52.180
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice, we're putting it in our system.
They know when it's due and then.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/234-0
00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:51.940
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/236-0
00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:56.629
<v Josh Sparkes>Payment due to be it's like a challenge
back and apologies for the challenge,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/236-1
00:54:56.629 --> 00:55:00.510
<v Josh Sparkes>is that do you need to notify them or as
they're inferred it's been paid?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/236-2
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:04.704
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the questions would just be for
urgent payments because if they're in a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/236-3
00:55:04.704 --> 00:55:07.798
<v Josh Sparkes>part of a batch,
they should be getting a remittance state</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/236-4
00:55:07.798 --> 00:55:10.420
<v Josh Sparkes>to them anyway.
Once we generate the payment run.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/237-0
00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:14.020
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's no need for that to get ailed
until the payment run.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/239-0
00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:17.495
<v Mark Sedge>So,
but so we could set the rules as to when</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/238-0
00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:16.580
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/239-1
00:55:17.495 --> 00:55:20.905
<v Mark Sedge>they would get, say,
when you trigger the notification based</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/239-2
00:55:20.905 --> 00:55:24.092
<v Mark Sedge>upon urgency and anything else that you
wouldn't bother,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/239-3
00:55:24.092 --> 00:55:28.396
<v Mark Sedge>because if they've got another mechanism
to tell them that it's done you you</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/242-0
00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:32.786
<v Josh Sparkes>I I think the I I think it is simple,
I think whatever the bulk payments we do</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/239-4
00:55:28.396 --> 00:55:28.900
<v Mark Sedge>wouldn't.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/242-1
00:55:32.786 --> 00:55:36.167
<v Josh Sparkes>once a week I think no rules needs to
apply on that. Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/242-2
00:55:36.167 --> 00:55:40.006
<v Josh Sparkes>there's no communication required,
but everything else needs to be</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/240-0
00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:39.380
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/242-3
00:55:40.006 --> 00:55:43.157
<v Josh Sparkes>communicated. I think that's simple. Yeah.
Yeah. Well,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/241-0
00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:42.980
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, agreed.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/242-4
00:55:43.157 --> 00:55:45.220
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got original request on your.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/243-0
00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:50.434
<v Josh Sparkes>Manage invoice you know with your
questions, you've got too many,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/243-1
00:55:50.434 --> 00:55:53.891
<v Josh Sparkes>but say for it's urgent event,
you've got a point of contact on there.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/243-2
00:55:53.891 --> 00:55:57.056
<v Josh Sparkes>Haven't you? Rather no.
So I mean nothing urgent will go on that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/243-3
00:55:57.056 --> 00:55:59.442
<v Josh Sparkes>file.
Urgent will they will contact us manually.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/243-4
00:55:59.442 --> 00:56:02.218
<v Josh Sparkes>Separately. Yeah.
We've managed the business pretty well</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/243-5
00:56:02.218 --> 00:56:05.870
<v Josh Sparkes>for them to know that once they sign up
the invoice and it's an on account</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/243-6
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:06.260
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/244-0
00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:09.694
<v Josh Sparkes>Otherwise, it's not urgent.
They know that we're going to get it</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/244-1
00:56:09.694 --> 00:56:12.791
<v Josh Sparkes>processed and we're going to get it
picked up in the batch.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/244-2
00:56:12.791 --> 00:56:16.868
<v Josh Sparkes>So and they don't need to import this.
And then first, yeah, I think the, the,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/244-3
00:56:16.868 --> 00:56:20.842
<v Josh Sparkes>the consistency and trust is there that
we don't have to communicate and the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/244-4
00:56:20.842 --> 00:56:23.990
<v Josh Sparkes>business doesn't need us to communicate
that kind of things.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/244-5
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:25.900
<v Josh Sparkes>It is just the padlock urgent out of.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/245-0
00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:29.100
<v Josh Sparkes>The ordinary out of our regular package
process, yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/245-1
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:33.638
<v Josh Sparkes>because that would generate then stop the
traffic that's coming into share mail</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/245-2
00:56:33.638 --> 00:56:36.362
<v Josh Sparkes>just now,
because a lot of that if they send an</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/245-3
00:56:36.362 --> 00:56:39.141
<v Josh Sparkes>urgent request, then for a payment,
if we don't,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/245-4
00:56:39.141 --> 00:56:43.340
<v Josh Sparkes>we then need to hold the ticket back.
But if we haven't got back to them.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/246-0
00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:48.340
<v Josh Sparkes>Or we don't because we forgot or whatever.
Then they then generate an e-mail saying</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/246-1
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:52.699
<v Josh Sparkes>can you let us know if it's been paid?
And then there's another one or they want</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/246-2
00:56:52.699 --> 00:56:56.143
<v Josh Sparkes>to see proof of payment.
So if they had that workflow that they</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/246-3
00:56:56.143 --> 00:56:59.963
<v Josh Sparkes>could see all the touch points,
then we would stop that traffic coming</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/246-4
00:56:59.963 --> 00:57:02.492
<v Josh Sparkes>through.
I think that's the differences in the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/246-5
00:57:02.492 --> 00:57:03.300
<v Josh Sparkes>systems, right.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/247-0
00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:05.867
<v Josh Sparkes>So share Will doesn't manage that very
well,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/247-1
00:57:05.867 --> 00:57:08.409
<v Josh Sparkes>we just say because they are being
requester,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/247-2
00:57:08.409 --> 00:57:12.333
<v Josh Sparkes>you can handshake with them at state
changes and keep them up to date.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/247-3
00:57:12.333 --> 00:57:16.755
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think it's an issue that probably
isn't even want to be there when we move</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/247-4
00:57:16.755 --> 00:57:19.740
<v Josh Sparkes>into ServiceNow,
what we just need to take the years.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/250-0
00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.636
<v Josh Sparkes>If you need notifications,
when should they be?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/250-1
00:57:22.636 --> 00:57:25.133
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's what we can configure in the
system,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/250-2
00:57:25.133 --> 00:57:29.190
<v Josh Sparkes>but we just need to think about it from
the perspective of we will have their</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/250-3
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:32.051
<v Josh Sparkes>dashboard view.
They can look at that if they want to.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/248-0
00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:31.740
<v Mark Sedge>Yep.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/250-4
00:57:32.051 --> 00:57:34.755
<v Josh Sparkes>But if there's something that you
actually have to,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/250-5
00:57:34.755 --> 00:57:36.420
<v Josh Sparkes>that's what it's getting bigger.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/252-0
00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:38.946
<v Mark Sedge>If it helps, if it helps some,
I've seen an organisation just have a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/251-0
00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:36.900
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/252-1
00:57:38.946 --> 00:57:43.790
<v Mark Sedge>tick box so if you get an urgent one and
you literally say do you want to send a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/252-2
00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:48.574
<v Mark Sedge>notification to the customer on this you
tick a flag and then as you go through</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/252-3
00:57:48.574 --> 00:57:52.940
<v Mark Sedge>the process the notification goes.
Anything else you don't have to flag.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/253-0
00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.863
<v Mark Sedge>It they don't get notified,
so that enables you to pick and choose</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/253-1
00:57:56.863 --> 00:58:00.554
<v Mark Sedge>because you might have a normal one.
But if it's a particularly tricky</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/253-2
00:58:00.554 --> 00:58:04.869
<v Mark Sedge>stakeholder that rings up and escalates,
you might tick the flag to say we'll send</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/253-3
00:58:04.869 --> 00:58:07.624
<v Mark Sedge>a notification for this one, right? Yeah.
There are.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/253-4
00:58:07.624 --> 00:58:09.340
<v Mark Sedge>There are a multitude of methods.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/254-0
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:11.780
<v Mark Sedge>To enable you to manage those.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/255-0
00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:16.425
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.
And I I think apart from the payment</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/255-1
00:58:16.425 --> 00:58:19.761
<v Josh Sparkes>files,
the manual or ad hoc or the urgent ones,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/255-2
00:58:19.761 --> 00:58:24.279
<v Josh Sparkes>the volume is really low,
at least I know in the UK I don't know</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/255-3
00:58:24.279 --> 00:58:28.380
<v Josh Sparkes>about yours, but it's pretty low.
So and even even though.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/256-0
00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:31.704
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
because the payment day technically over</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/256-1
00:58:31.704 --> 00:58:35.707
<v Josh Sparkes>here in the UK is Tuesday.
So if we could only process it on fusion</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/256-2
00:58:35.707 --> 00:58:38.415
<v Josh Sparkes>and it is urgent,
so that is different thing,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/256-3
00:58:38.415 --> 00:58:41.712
<v Josh Sparkes>but it is we're talking like I would say
5-6 in a week.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/256-4
00:58:41.712 --> 00:58:44.420
<v Josh Sparkes>You know I don't think so anything more
than.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/258-0
00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:48.174
<v Josh Sparkes>It's it's very low and mark,
give me if I'm wrong.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/258-1
00:58:48.174 --> 00:58:51.756
<v Josh Sparkes>I said notifications.
We tend to associate with an e-mail in</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/258-2
00:58:51.756 --> 00:58:55.866
<v Josh Sparkes>terms of notification. You know,
like if you are still being notified</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/258-3
00:58:55.866 --> 00:58:58.508
<v Josh Sparkes>through the portal of your you know
request.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/258-4
00:58:58.508 --> 00:59:01.679
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you get into that modelling and
good behaviour,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/258-5
00:59:01.679 --> 00:59:04.380
<v Josh Sparkes>this is where I go to see my activity
that's.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/257-0
00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:04.540
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/259-0
00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:08.576
<v Josh Sparkes>We want to get through,
so I think I'm sending an e-mail,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/259-1
00:59:08.576 --> 00:59:13.289
<v Josh Sparkes>but I think it's a notification,
but it's still you are still sending a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/259-2
00:59:13.289 --> 00:59:18.329
<v Josh Sparkes>notification but it is via the portal.
I think that's more important for you</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/259-3
00:59:18.329 --> 00:59:19.900
<v Josh Sparkes>managing OPS they would.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/260-0
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:24.330
<v Josh Sparkes>Issue if you're sending out a
notification. Yeah. Agree.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/260-1
00:59:24.330 --> 00:59:29.639
<v Josh Sparkes>I think when we're talking about the
disbursement invoices. All right, 'cause,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/260-2
00:59:29.639 --> 00:59:32.260
<v Josh Sparkes>that's what our professional costs are.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/261-0
00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:39.907
<v Josh Sparkes>A notification that can get sent out to
confirm that the invoice has been</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/261-1
00:59:39.907 --> 00:59:45.296
<v Josh Sparkes>processed is one of the top priorities
for our key stakeholder group that send</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/261-2
00:59:45.296 --> 00:59:49.866
<v Josh Sparkes>us those invoices. Sorry,
that's a whole different type of payment</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/261-3
00:59:49.866 --> 00:59:54.300
<v Josh Sparkes>that we have a payment process and
payment eligibility for that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/262-0
00:59:54.700 --> 01:00:00.011
<v Josh Sparkes>So we don't have to confirm when things
necessarily get paid at that point,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/262-1
01:00:00.011 --> 01:00:04.484
<v Josh Sparkes>but that kind of at the moment we send
off a resolution e-mail.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/262-2
01:00:04.484 --> 01:00:09.865
<v Josh Sparkes>So we say we've received your invoice,
it's been processed and the team know</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/262-3
01:00:09.865 --> 01:00:13.500
<v Josh Sparkes>that then that's ready to be picked up
for billing.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/263-0
01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:19.107
<v Josh Sparkes>That that is a resolution notification.
At the moment it is e-mail that isn't so</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/263-1
01:00:19.107 --> 01:00:21.860
<v Josh Sparkes>the notification mechanism is e-mail for
you,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/263-2
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:26.468
<v Josh Sparkes>but notification in the future will be
via the as a request that they can go</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/263-3
01:00:26.468 --> 01:00:29.700
<v Josh Sparkes>into their portal and they can see that
notification.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/264-0
01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:35.740
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's still a resolution notification.
Yeah, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/265-0
01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:39.780
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good notifications good.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/266-0
01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:47.671
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Talk around. Slas. Yeah, slas.
I think we've got some Slas of weekly</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/266-1
01:00:47.671 --> 01:00:51.897
<v Josh Sparkes>payment runs urgent.
You tend to be within the due date,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/266-2
01:00:51.897 --> 01:00:55.900
<v Josh Sparkes>is that right?
When they need to be paid so due date?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/267-0
01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:00.403
<v Josh Sparkes>-1,
you know it needs to be done now because</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/267-1
01:01:00.403 --> 01:01:05.416
<v Josh Sparkes>it was zero. Yeah, day zero.
So you've got the weekly charges of ones</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/267-2
01:01:05.416 --> 01:01:10.287
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got and the urgent ones. Yeah.
Yeah, we are we in Australia.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/267-3
01:01:10.287 --> 01:01:13.940
<v Josh Sparkes>We do have a handful of monthlies. Right.
OK. SCM.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/268-0
01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.780
<v Josh Sparkes>You get picked up and again.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/270-0
01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:23.542
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So we have weekly a weekly scheduled,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/270-1
01:01:23.542 --> 01:01:27.264
<v Josh Sparkes>but in on the 30th of or 31st of the
month,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/270-2
01:01:27.264 --> 01:01:32.340
<v Josh Sparkes>we have 2-3 other suppliers that are paid
on monthly basis.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/271-0
01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:34.900
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/272-0
01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.980
<v Josh Sparkes>And you don't have anything that's based
on six months.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/272-1
01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:43.008
<v Josh Sparkes>You know there's nothing longer than a
month, is it?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/272-2
01:01:43.008 --> 01:01:45.980
<v Josh Sparkes>It's almost within the month,
within 30 days terms.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/273-0
01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:02.923
<v Josh Sparkes>And even annual payments we picked up on
a monthly process. Yeah, actually, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/273-1
01:02:02.923 --> 01:02:06.099
<v Josh Sparkes>Like,
it doesn't really matter what someone's</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/273-2
01:02:06.099 --> 01:02:09.898
<v Josh Sparkes>payment permits are.
They'll get picked up in the next</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/273-3
01:02:09.898 --> 01:02:13.420
<v Josh Sparkes>relevant weekly payment run. Yeah,
it's just that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/274-0
01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:18.996
<v Josh Sparkes>The couple of monthly supplies that
Australia pays is most of the time</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/274-1
01:02:18.996 --> 01:02:24.977
<v Josh Sparkes>processed outside of the weeklies because
they're due on the last day of the month.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/274-2
01:02:24.977 --> 01:02:29.820
<v Josh Sparkes>So unless our weekly payment run ends on
the last day of the month.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/275-0
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.020
<v Josh Sparkes>We do that separately. OK.
That's the only difference, OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/276-0
01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:40.693
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it was a good place. Yeah.
I think Mike got everything there. Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/276-1
01:02:40.693 --> 01:02:45.206
<v Josh Sparkes>a quick break and I can just quickly look
at the all other processes that I need</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/276-2
01:02:45.206 --> 01:02:47.100
<v Josh Sparkes>around, we have 5 minutes I think.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/277-0
01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:54.568
<v Josh Sparkes>I want to double check, so you're paying.
You know who you're paying impacts are</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/277-1
01:02:54.568 --> 01:02:58.668
<v Josh Sparkes>paying. I mean, we've got multiple.
I think there are credit card payments</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/277-2
01:02:58.668 --> 01:03:01.456
<v Josh Sparkes>for recall,
global payments and immediate payments</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/277-3
01:03:01.456 --> 01:03:03.260
<v Josh Sparkes>that we cover that, but they are.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/278-0
01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.356
<v Josh Sparkes>Payments. You know, there is AI.
Think invoice.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/278-1
01:03:07.356 --> 01:03:12.140
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just actually probably just a caveat
that all your payment are.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/279-0
01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:17.053
<v Josh Sparkes>Off the back of an invoice like. Yeah.
Generally. Yeah. OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/279-1
01:03:17.053 --> 01:03:21.555
<v Josh Sparkes>It's realised that is a business order.
Every payment is off the back of an</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/279-2
01:03:21.555 --> 01:03:22.740
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/280-0
01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:31.320
<v Josh Sparkes>Or there's maybe like one or two payments.
So.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/280-1
01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:37.862
<v Josh Sparkes>So AP Payments Council pay with payments?
Yes, I think at the back of the invoices.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/280-2
01:03:37.862 --> 01:03:40.900
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Such a good visible payment equals.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/281-0
01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:46.324
<v Josh Sparkes>In in you know prerequisite is a trigger
of an ending.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/281-1
01:03:46.324 --> 01:03:52.822
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia does internal like account
Inter account transfers as well,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/281-2
01:03:52.822 --> 01:03:59.597
<v Josh Sparkes>which I would generally class as a
general Ledger like firm cost payment</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/281-3
01:03:59.597 --> 01:04:00.340
<v Josh Sparkes>because.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/282-0
01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:06.021
<v Josh Sparkes>Post to our Ledger and that's moving
money between between between internal it</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/282-1
01:04:06.021 --> 01:04:09.096
<v Josh Sparkes>could be coming over to the UK or vice
versa.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/282-2
01:04:09.096 --> 01:04:14.244
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's not triggered off an invoice
that's triggered off a request from a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/282-3
01:04:14.244 --> 01:04:19.324
<v Josh Sparkes>different manager. If we need to,
like we might do, we might sell some U.S.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/282-4
01:04:19.324 --> 01:04:20.060
<v Josh Sparkes>dollars if.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/283-0
01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:24.019
<v Josh Sparkes>The If it's a concentration,
even been tried. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/283-1
01:04:24.019 --> 01:04:28.904
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think that's The only exception
where Australia processes a payment</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/283-2
01:04:28.904 --> 01:04:33.990
<v Josh Sparkes>that's not triggered from an invoice.
But I would say that I would say that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/283-3
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.860
<v Josh Sparkes>that's maybe.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/284-0
01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:40.649
<v Josh Sparkes>The most common one is transferring
between an operating account and an</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/284-1
01:04:40.649 --> 01:04:43.140
<v Josh Sparkes>investment account. That probably happens.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/285-0
01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:51.379
<v Josh Sparkes>Between three and five times a week and
then now. Yeah, it's quite. Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/285-1
01:04:51.379 --> 01:04:56.646
<v Josh Sparkes>it's quite often.
And then any inter currency trades that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/285-2
01:04:56.646 --> 01:05:00.460
<v Josh Sparkes>we do might be once a quarter, that's why.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/286-0
01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:04.956
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just thinking in terms of because
you're not managing,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/286-1
01:05:04.956 --> 01:05:09.092
<v Josh Sparkes>you're managing your payments. Yeah,
and it does. We don't it trick.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/286-2
01:05:09.092 --> 01:05:12.328
<v Josh Sparkes>It's triggered off a request.
So one of our managers,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/286-3
01:05:12.328 --> 01:05:16.404
<v Josh Sparkes>one of our treasury managers,
will tell us how much to transfer and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/286-4
01:05:16.404 --> 01:05:20.120
<v Josh Sparkes>what the movement is,
whether it's operating to investment or</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/286-5
01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:20.780
<v Josh Sparkes>investment.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/287-0
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:24.271
<v Josh Sparkes>Operating,
but we don't know when or how much until</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/287-1
01:05:24.271 --> 01:05:27.199
<v Josh Sparkes>we get told,
so it's still a request that comes</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/287-2
01:05:27.199 --> 01:05:31.834
<v Josh Sparkes>through. It's just on invoice. Yeah,
I'm just thinking whether and it's not</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/287-3
01:05:31.834 --> 01:05:35.860
<v Josh Sparkes>quite managing invoice,
but it's managing a non invoice payments.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/288-0
01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:42.340
<v Josh Sparkes>Of which you're picking up that payments
process and then you've got the details</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/288-1
01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:48.220
<v Josh Sparkes>as you said into department or currency
based. So not going to stick it up as a.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/289-0
01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:54.088
<v Josh Sparkes>Mark,
because if I'm on maybe a sub task within</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/289-1
01:05:54.088 --> 01:05:58.662
<v Josh Sparkes>the overall managed invoice,
you're just picking up a subsection of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/289-2
01:05:58.662 --> 01:06:02.227
<v Josh Sparkes>that process,
but there could be a task we can reuse</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/289-3
01:06:02.227 --> 01:06:05.456
<v Josh Sparkes>half within that,
but it's still got a request,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/289-4
01:06:05.456 --> 01:06:07.340
<v Josh Sparkes>but you do that only that's.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/290-0
01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:12.385
<v Josh Sparkes>AP requested it or can anybody request it?
There's only there's two people that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/290-1
01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:15.027
<v Josh Sparkes>would ever request it,
one of two managers,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/290-2
01:06:15.027 --> 01:06:19.232
<v Josh Sparkes>and they would send that request to
accounts payable and it has to be</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/290-3
01:06:19.232 --> 01:06:22.775
<v Josh Sparkes>processed same data.
They sit outside of accounts payable.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/290-4
01:06:22.775 --> 01:06:27.100
<v Josh Sparkes>They're not, they're finance,
but they sit outside of accounts payable.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/292-0
01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:33.360
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're part of our wider finance team
like that. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/292-1
01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:39.401
<v Josh Sparkes>The the technical part of that. OK,
that that finance management team. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/291-0
01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:35.820
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/292-2
01:06:39.401 --> 01:06:42.540
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. And they that does need to be if we.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/293-0
01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:45.606
<v Josh Sparkes>Have that request floated through
ServiceNow. Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/293-1
01:06:45.606 --> 01:06:49.336
<v Josh Sparkes>they'll have to be a high priority
because we have to process it same day.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/294-0
01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:53.473
<v Mark Sedge>So so question, how do they request it?
How do they request it currently just via</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/293-2
01:06:49.336 --> 01:06:50.580
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. The request Gen like.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/294-1
01:06:53.473 --> 01:06:53.860
<v Mark Sedge>e-mail?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/295-0
01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:58.060
<v Josh Sparkes>E-mail. Yeah, sorry.
Then the e-mail creates ticket.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/297-0
01:06:55.540 --> 01:07:00.036
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So what we could if, yeah,
if they're a controlled group,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/297-1
01:07:00.036 --> 01:07:03.127
<v Mark Sedge>then you know when they go into the
portal,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/297-2
01:07:03.127 --> 01:07:08.747
<v Mark Sedge>they could have that request item only
visible to that group and therefore they</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/297-3
01:07:08.747 --> 01:07:12.260
<v Mark Sedge>could just trigger it, as you say,
via a request.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/298-0
01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:16.933
<v Mark Sedge>They could put in all of the information
that you need to action it in terms of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/298-1
01:07:16.933 --> 01:07:21.007
<v Mark Sedge>the values that they want, you know,
from account X to account Y or whatever</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/298-2
01:07:21.007 --> 01:07:24.341
<v Mark Sedge>you could do that as a really neat
request form just for them,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/298-3
01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:26.140
<v Mark Sedge>and then it wouldn't be an e-mail.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/301-0
01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:29.324
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that would be cool,
because if we could do that as a form</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/301-1
01:07:29.324 --> 01:07:32.673
<v Josh Sparkes>where it's transferred from account to
account,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/299-0
01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:32.940
<v Mark Sedge>Exactly.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/301-2
01:07:32.673 --> 01:07:38.533
<v Josh Sparkes>how much and then there's a an option for
an approval that one of our just approved</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/300-0
01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.380
<v Mark Sedge>Yes, 100%.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/301-3
01:07:38.533 --> 01:07:42.580
<v Josh Sparkes>that then that's that, yeah,
that would work really well.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/302-0
01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:47.902
<v Josh Sparkes>If if the manage invoice,
you know it's a payment but with not an</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/302-1
01:07:47.902 --> 01:07:51.974
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice. So we're just saying it's part,
we could create it from a task within</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/302-2
01:07:51.974 --> 01:07:55.376
<v Josh Sparkes>that whole workflow. Yeah,
they're populating essentially there's</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/302-3
01:07:55.376 --> 01:07:57.180
<v Josh Sparkes>visible spend via the portal. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/303-0
01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.940
<v Mark Sedge>It's a it's kind of like just a funds
transfer, isn't it?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/304-0
01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:03.781
<v Josh Sparkes>Do we do we want to separate survey? Yeah,
it is separate service though.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/304-1
01:08:03.781 --> 01:08:09.162
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just part of our Australian cash
management. It doesn't happen in the UK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/304-2
01:08:09.162 --> 01:08:14.340
<v Josh Sparkes>The UK don't do the internal transfers,
but we do have the top up accounts.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/306-0
01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:19.385
<v Josh Sparkes>So like the old cash must be that that we
need to make sure that the balance of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/306-1
01:08:19.385 --> 01:08:23.275
<v Josh Sparkes>these accounts doesn't fall below a
certain amount and if it does,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/305-0
01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:23.060
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/306-2
01:08:23.275 --> 01:08:27.340
<v Josh Sparkes>we need to do a payment for them.
So there's not an invoice for that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/307-0
01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:29.780
<v Mark Sedge>And is that a closed?
Is that closed group requesters as well?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/309-0
01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:34.937
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just through AP, it's just AP,
but maybe we would need to send it to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/308-0
01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:35.540
<v Mark Sedge>Right. Gotcha.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/309-1
01:08:34.937 --> 01:08:36.980
<v Josh Sparkes>that user to release from the bank.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/310-0
01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:38.140
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/311-0
01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:42.332
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know how to tell or not that bond.
As you said,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/311-1
01:08:42.332 --> 01:08:45.220
<v Josh Sparkes>it's being populated a a task going
forward.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/312-0
01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:51.260
<v Josh Sparkes>But for this particular ones to get rid
specific problem.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/316-0
01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.616
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
I I I've seen these as just a funds</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/316-1
01:08:50.616 --> 01:08:55.409
<v Mark Sedge>transfer form and it's a specific form
that says from here to here by this date</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/313-0
01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:52.820
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/316-2
01:08:55.409 --> 01:08:58.345
<v Mark Sedge>or whatever.
And here's the and then you have an</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/314-0
01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:56.580
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/316-3
01:08:58.345 --> 01:09:02.060
<v Mark Sedge>automated approval,
someone just rubber stamps it and then it</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/315-0
01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:01.180
<v Josh Sparkes>Thanks.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/316-4
01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:02.540
<v Mark Sedge>happens.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/317-0
01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:07.493
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. But I think we've captured,
I think it came out the back of this</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/317-1
01:09:07.493 --> 01:09:10.382
<v Josh Sparkes>process is one you know invoice equals
payment,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/317-2
01:09:10.382 --> 01:09:15.257
<v Josh Sparkes>but we've now captured the ones that are
payments without invoices which could I</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/317-3
01:09:15.257 --> 01:09:19.832
<v Josh Sparkes>was just chatting the Lord now later on
the one that she just raised there.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/317-4
01:09:19.832 --> 01:09:22.300
<v Josh Sparkes>I wonder if some sort of scheduled tasks.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/318-0
01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:27.481
<v Josh Sparkes>The case would be good for that process
and it's something that the teams monitor</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/318-1
01:09:27.481 --> 01:09:31.371
<v Josh Sparkes>the bank accounts every once in a way of
themselves. So if we agree,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/318-2
01:09:31.371 --> 01:09:35.654
<v Josh Sparkes>if we consider that we could set up a
scheduled case and that can then help</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/318-3
01:09:35.654 --> 01:09:37.740
<v Josh Sparkes>them, that's a frequency, sure, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/319-0
01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:44.116
<v Josh Sparkes>In that process.
So we've got two cash plants or say I</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/319-1
01:09:44.116 --> 01:09:50.420
<v Josh Sparkes>think it's called now and intellectual
property for themselves.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/320-0
01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:55.540
<v Josh Sparkes>Don't believe they're saving more?
That's the I can make company up my head.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/321-0
01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:04.020
<v Josh Sparkes>But they're both scheduled. Well, yeah,
they're top up. And so as and when we see,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/321-1
01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:06.926
<v Josh Sparkes>like,
people using the accounts and like the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/321-2
01:10:06.926 --> 01:10:10.802
<v Josh Sparkes>the cashless ones,
we take every week because there's cards</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/321-3
01:10:10.802 --> 01:10:16.097
<v Josh Sparkes>out in the business. But the other one,
we don't necessarily see that until these</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/321-4
01:10:16.097 --> 01:10:18.100
<v Josh Sparkes>things in an e-mail and for us.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/322-0
01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:24.040
<v Josh Sparkes>I was asking to process the cost to the
matter, so we then check the the account.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/322-1
01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:29.719
<v Josh Sparkes>From that we get statements sent from
them and if it also will certainly mainly</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/322-2
01:10:29.719 --> 01:10:35.255
<v Josh Sparkes>and we want to talk about their time and
are they those are those class marks</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/322-3
01:10:35.255 --> 01:10:37.740
<v Josh Sparkes>payments that we also talked about.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/323-0
01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:42.724
<v Josh Sparkes>As well, or the in addition to, you know,
good cash cards that we mentioned,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/323-1
01:10:42.724 --> 01:10:46.679
<v Josh Sparkes>cash card, that's what exactly.
So I'm just thinking because we're</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/323-2
01:10:46.679 --> 01:10:50.988
<v Josh Sparkes>following that, but that's an activity,
you've got the cash cards, yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/323-3
01:10:50.988 --> 01:10:52.700
<v Josh Sparkes>building that together, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/324-0
01:10:54.020 --> 01:11:00.001
<v Josh Sparkes>Phone and he's captured in the MPL and
he's lobbins shower slash plus. Well,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/324-1
01:11:00.001 --> 01:11:05.749
<v Josh Sparkes>certainly intellectual property.
The intellectual property is just the an</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/324-2
01:11:05.749 --> 01:11:10.100
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail when they when they use the
account that we get.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/325-0
01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:15.823
<v Josh Sparkes>Statements from intellectual property and
it tells us like to spend.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/325-1
01:11:15.823 --> 01:11:20.100
<v Josh Sparkes>So we know then one action if we need to
talk about this, yes,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/325-2
01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:24.715
<v Josh Sparkes>they will be on share, bill.
But whether they're on the MPL or not,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/325-3
01:11:24.715 --> 01:11:26.820
<v Josh Sparkes>we need to check. I don't know.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/326-0
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:28.820
<v Josh Sparkes>Tim, is it not this one?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/327-0
01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.420
<v Josh Sparkes>And so that's property postings.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/329-0
01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:37.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, you can't, really.
I'll get you a number.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/330-0
01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:43.858
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll have a quick peek and then come
back to finalise this quick review of all</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/330-1
01:11:43.858 --> 01:11:45.940
<v Josh Sparkes>23 little bits have been published.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/331-0
01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:56.544
<v Josh Sparkes>And then so I think you mentioned the
intellectual property and then we'll go</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/331-1
01:11:56.544 --> 01:12:00.599
<v Josh Sparkes>on to expense,
manage expenses and manage expense</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/331-2
01:12:00.599 --> 01:12:04.815
<v Josh Sparkes>management.
That's the last bit and that's the last</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/331-3
01:12:04.815 --> 01:12:05.140
<v Josh Sparkes>bit.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/332-0
01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:09.260
<v Josh Sparkes>That should be simpler. Let's see.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/333-0
01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:11.871

<v Mark Sedge>break. When are we coming back?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/336-0

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/340-0
01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:24.660
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/341-0
01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:27.740

<v Josh Sparkes>I am about to.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/344-0
01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:52.736
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, maybe they're all not mad,
but all of that,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/344-1
01:12:52.736 --> 01:12:57.842
<v Josh Sparkes>and then the third one is not important.
You have different buildings. Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/344-2
01:12:57.842 --> 01:13:02.219
<v Josh Sparkes>they're like, 15 expenses.

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/344-3
01:13:02.219 --> 01:13:04.740

<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, actually, no.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/346-0
01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:41.113
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's a nice to get that.
It's easier between us and it's much easy</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/346-1
01:13:41.113 --> 01:13:43.220

<v Josh Sparkes>It's not a framework. Your thing,
they're just. Yeah, I don't know.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/348-3

<v Josh Sparkes>I.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/352-0
01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:16.340
<v Josh Sparkes>I know.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/353-0
01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:21.518
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. All right, I know.
I think that's the quite similar.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/353-1
01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:23.260
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like a Penguin.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/354-0
01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:48.500
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not quite right.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/355-0
01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:15.100

<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Then the other.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/365-0
01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:37.380

01:19:31.728 --> 01:19:35.439
<v Josh Sparkes>need? Yeah,
I think we're filling in the gaps that we</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/368-2

<v Josh Sparkes>need. Yeah. And we should finish.
Should finish it all today. Nearly done.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/368-3
01:19:40.592 --> 01:19:44.715
<v Josh Sparkes>No, that's right.
Just make sure you're getting it going to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/368-4
01:19:44.715 --> 01:19:45.540
<v Josh Sparkes>pay as well.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/369-0
01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:48.877
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
listen to kind of challenge it and draw</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/369-1
01:19:48.877 --> 01:19:51.939
<v Josh Sparkes>it out. Yeah,
as well as bring it up to a service</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/369-2
01:19:51.939 --> 01:19:55.736
<v Josh Sparkes>rather than, yeah. Line by line. Yeah.
Remembering all books.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/369-3
01:19:55.736 --> 01:19:59.962
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes they like to. Yeah,
but you're getting everything you need</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/369-4
01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:03.820
<v Josh Sparkes>out of it as well. Like,
I'm not getting any negative cutback.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/369-5
01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:05.780
<v Josh Sparkes>That's all I need at the moment.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/370-0
01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:10.909
<v Josh Sparkes>And so that's OK. Tell me is oh,
adjustment for this whole. Yeah. No,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/370-1
01:20:10.909 --> 01:20:16.418
<v Josh Sparkes>I think everyone of them, you know,
same as you get everything you need like</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/370-2
01:20:16.418 --> 01:20:22.000
<v Josh Sparkes>and I think the feedbacks are but like
it's a lot I think everybody's feeling</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/370-3
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.220
<v Josh Sparkes>that right.
But I think that's also kind of.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/371-0
01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:25.620
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/372-0
01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:31.067
<v Josh Sparkes>That's fine. That's all. Well,
it we're trying to make it simple,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/372-1
01:20:31.067 --> 01:20:36.070
<v Josh Sparkes>but not on the undermined process. Yeah,
we ought to give it the. Obviously,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/372-2
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:40.357
<v Josh Sparkes>you don't want to make it.
Maybe even if it's more than to do it.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/372-3
01:20:40.357 --> 01:20:43.476
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
but you're also drawing up with insights.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/372-4
01:20:43.476 --> 01:20:45.100
<v Josh Sparkes>And otherwise we are 100.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/373-0
01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:49.771
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's an element.
You just have to carry on.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/373-1
01:20:49.771 --> 01:20:53.635
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just like right, like it's not that.
It's fine.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/373-2
01:20:53.635 --> 01:20:59.321
<v Josh Sparkes>It's I think it's users always good
examples. Exactly what's that engagement.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/373-3
01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:04.643
<v Josh Sparkes>Otherwise it would be, yeah. Very.
And I think natural level it's a good</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/373-4
01:21:04.643 --> 01:21:05.300
<v Josh Sparkes>approach.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/374-0
01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:15.306
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's kind of been impressive because
one thing, yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/374-1
01:21:15.306 --> 01:21:23.460
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's why it's sort of changed
with all the.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/375-0
01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:26.104
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
they were high volumes and it's sort of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/375-1
01:21:26.104 --> 01:21:28.984
<v Josh Sparkes>scared like, Oh my God, if I if I stop,
think about that,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/375-2
01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:33.006
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm going to drop job saying, you know,
it's that process I've just got to carry</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/375-3
01:21:33.006 --> 01:21:35.836
<v Josh Sparkes>on because if I stop,
there'll be too much go back long.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/375-4
01:21:35.836 --> 01:21:39.610
<v Josh Sparkes>There's no time to to address it.
But I think that's the that will come out</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/375-5
01:21:39.610 --> 01:21:42.540
<v Josh Sparkes>when they start to be the ease of it.
Exactly and I think.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/376-0
01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:46.337
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not necessarily character trait.
It's also can be overwhelmed.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/376-1
01:21:46.337 --> 01:21:49.547
<v Josh Sparkes>It can be we've never seen a different
doing. That's right.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/376-2
01:21:49.547 --> 01:21:54.094
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just something we need. Like we said,
like there is a big way of thought we can</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/376-3
01:21:54.094 --> 01:21:56.769
<v Josh Sparkes>do that.
I think there's when I did it in Africa,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/376-4
01:21:56.769 --> 01:22:00.140
<v Josh Sparkes>things but sensitive to is it working
safe? Yeah, I mean very.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/378-0
01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:05.207
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
And then I will know that labour</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/378-1
01:22:05.207 --> 01:22:10.022
<v Josh Sparkes>intensity, I want it because I'm busy.
Yeah, it's a lot of uncertainty, really,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/378-2
01:22:10.022 --> 01:22:14.415
<v Josh Sparkes>every team. So if that comes out,
I think the best thing is that exactly</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/378-3
01:22:14.415 --> 01:22:18.989
<v Josh Sparkes>part of what you did just kind of like
the dresses. Like we're just making,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/378-4
01:22:18.989 --> 01:22:22.300
<v Josh Sparkes>I think I think my answer to it on all
that certainly.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/379-0
01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:26.757
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's not our remit either,
but you actually gives you the headspace</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/379-1
01:22:26.757 --> 01:22:30.618
<v Josh Sparkes>to add value to correct,
because actually I need such in my book</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/379-2
01:22:30.618 --> 01:22:35.548
<v Josh Sparkes>that three CS that you've completed it.
Yeah, but then you've got the other value.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/379-3
01:22:35.548 --> 01:22:40.003
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're complete, is it correct?
And your compliance with the alphabet?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/379-4
01:22:40.003 --> 01:22:40.300
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/380-0
01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:43.637
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So this just frees up that you then have</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/380-1
01:22:43.637 --> 01:22:47.009
<v Josh Sparkes>time a bit like an individual and you've
got time to become healthy.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/380-2
01:22:47.009 --> 01:22:51.017
<v Josh Sparkes>And so your process is to become healthy
and that's probably what I probably need</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/380-3
01:22:51.017 --> 01:22:54.146
<v Josh Sparkes>to talk to a bit more about.
I think that would really be good.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/380-4
01:22:54.146 --> 01:22:56.883
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that will bring up the time like
an individual,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/380-5
01:22:56.883 --> 01:23:00.304
<v Josh Sparkes>but you spend your time on getting
healthier in your systems and your</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/380-6
01:23:00.304 --> 01:23:00.940
<v Josh Sparkes>applications.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/381-0
01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:13.199
<v Josh Sparkes>3 theme replacing. Yeah,
which is the service now. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/381-1
01:23:13.199 --> 01:23:19.340
<v Josh Sparkes>What do you want? Expense management.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/382-0
01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:22.900
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, to the to the invoice one.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/383-0
01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:32.980
<v Josh Sparkes>This is invoicing then ready? Yeah,
I've just seen this text and textbooks.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/384-0
01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:38.140
<v Josh Sparkes>There's there's disbursements as well.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/385-0
01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:45.580
<v Josh Sparkes>Upload did that. Yeah, one. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/386-0
01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:47.180
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/387-0
01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:55.820
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm sorry that I realised that I thought
we've done invoice manage invoice but I</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/387-1
01:23:55.820 --> 01:24:01.345
<v Josh Sparkes>realised there was two processes in our
maybe 3 tax and split tag.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/387-2
01:24:01.345 --> 01:24:03.820
<v Josh Sparkes>So maybe would you mind if we?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/388-0
01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:07.787
<v Josh Sparkes>Address.
I'm thinking I'm not on marking those.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/388-1
01:24:07.787 --> 01:24:12.085
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's. Yeah.
So there's three of those first months,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/388-2
01:24:12.085 --> 01:24:17.007
<v Josh Sparkes>which will come tomorrow. OK.
I thought that we must both professional</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/388-3
01:24:17.007 --> 01:24:19.780
<v Josh Sparkes>cost of the same thing. OK, but that is.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/389-0
01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:22.917
<v Josh Sparkes>A.
So the AP task in Australia cashier's</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/389-1
01:24:22.917 --> 01:24:26.696
<v Josh Sparkes>task in the UK,
but I think it's going to be easier or</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/389-2
01:24:26.696 --> 01:24:31.506
<v Josh Sparkes>better to align the processes cashier's,
but I think it for you guys,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/389-3
01:24:31.506 --> 01:24:37.002
<v Josh Sparkes>just be mindful that that task is still
going to sit with the AP is still going</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/389-4
01:24:37.002 --> 01:24:39.820
<v Josh Sparkes>to be need to need to be linked with the.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/390-0
01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:42.580
<v Josh Sparkes>Accounts available in Australia, OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/391-0
01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:51.021
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah, OK.
So just quickly captured the other two.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/391-1
01:24:51.021 --> 01:24:59.740
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think it was tax PO, non PO,
POPO actually fix vouchers, OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/392-0
01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:04.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Payment travel matter. Oh, no. Here.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/393-0
01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:15.498
<v Josh Sparkes>In this company bank that can transfers,
that's good. Did that one? Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/393-1
01:25:15.498 --> 01:25:18.620
<v Josh Sparkes>that's it. That's it. OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/394-0
01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:31.096
<v Josh Sparkes>Portal request with queries. Oh yeah,
via the portal via the request coming in</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/394-1
01:25:31.096 --> 01:25:34.580
<v Josh Sparkes>or the third party. Yeah, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/395-0
01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:42.901
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, so split tags and tags.
There were some processes on there like.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/395-1
01:25:42.901 --> 01:25:46.878
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably thought maybe we can discuss
them all.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/395-2
01:25:46.878 --> 01:25:51.020
<v Josh Sparkes>Whether that is part of the managing the
invoice.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/397-0
01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:58.914
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just an absolutely of processing the
invoice so we get invoices and that and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/397-1
01:25:58.914 --> 01:26:02.611
<v Josh Sparkes>that only invoices.
So we still get the invoice and the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/397-2
01:26:02.611 --> 01:26:05.781
<v Josh Sparkes>players won't,
but it's just a different way of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/397-3
01:26:05.781 --> 01:26:08.950
<v Josh Sparkes>processing it and the same way they split
that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/397-4
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:12.780
<v Josh Sparkes>So just now if we split that an invoice
that's on appeal.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/398-0
01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:15.946
<v Josh Sparkes>I know we have to process that and a
definite way,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/398-1
01:26:15.946 --> 01:26:19.032
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's still under invoice process and
so right,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/398-2
01:26:19.032 --> 01:26:22.240
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just that internal how we process
that process.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/398-3
01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:27.202
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not however getting the invoice and
dealing with it process and did you want</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/398-4
01:26:27.202 --> 01:26:31.620
<v Josh Sparkes>to capture that on the request that it's
tax suspend tax no that that's.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/399-0
01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:39.418
<v Josh Sparkes>The APM process like how we actually
physically process that one to the system</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/399-1
01:26:39.418 --> 01:26:43.846
<v Josh Sparkes>that's in the doing, yeah,
that's in the doing. Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/399-2
01:26:43.846 --> 01:26:47.864
<v Josh Sparkes>that's on the items on here coming from
our MPL,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/399-3
01:26:47.864 --> 01:26:52.620
<v Josh Sparkes>different variations of appear or non
period voice, it's.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/400-0
01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:56.234
<v Josh Sparkes>Just the way that it gets put into 3K for
us.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/400-1
01:26:56.234 --> 01:27:01.942
<v Josh Sparkes>So broadly my staff that's been under
that PO and on PO Bracket. OK, sorry.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/400-2
01:27:01.942 --> 01:27:07.425
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's how we had learned,
I mean again not you know sometimes we're</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/400-3
01:27:07.425 --> 01:27:11.180
<v Josh Sparkes>not trivialising and then gone through
all these.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/401-0
01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:14.907
<v Josh Sparkes>Processes based on the work that Tim has
done in all of you.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/401-1
01:27:14.907 --> 01:27:19.301
<v Josh Sparkes>It went very well that we've been doing
them up to the level of managing an</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/401-2
01:27:19.301 --> 01:27:22.307
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice,
so it looked like it was a different type,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/401-3
01:27:22.307 --> 01:27:26.991
<v Josh Sparkes>but I've realised that I just needed to
clarify that there's still other type of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/401-4
01:27:26.991 --> 01:27:29.940
<v Josh Sparkes>under managing modes. Yeah,
I think the only item.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/402-0
01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:33.420
<v Josh Sparkes>For on this list for Australia,
that kind of.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/403-0
01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:40.124
<v Josh Sparkes>As a it's similar workflow toward a non
PO invoice would go through,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/403-1
01:27:40.124 --> 01:27:45.007
<v Josh Sparkes>but the payment side of things is
different. Is the pexa invoice.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/403-2
01:27:45.007 --> 01:27:50.260
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh yeah no pexa I think that is at the
top. That's oz. That's oz only.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/405-0
01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:53.950
<v Josh Sparkes>So Pixar is property exchange Australia.
Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/405-1
01:27:53.950 --> 01:27:57.520
<v Josh Sparkes>It's where all of our property
settlements go through.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/405-2
01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:02.194
<v Josh Sparkes>We will be mentioning that tomorrow on
cashiers because all of a lot of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/405-3
01:28:02.194 --> 01:28:06.413
<v Josh Sparkes>settlements go through there.
But through the Pixar is an online</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/405-4
01:28:06.413 --> 01:28:08.620
<v Josh Sparkes>platform. And through that portal.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/406-0
01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:15.117
<v Josh Sparkes>We can also lodge what's called a pexa
fee or lodgement fees for different</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/406-1
01:28:15.117 --> 01:28:20.755
<v Josh Sparkes>searches and different settlements.
So separate to the settlements,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/406-2
01:28:20.755 --> 01:28:24.900
<v Josh Sparkes>some of these fees are lodged online and
debited.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/407-0
01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:29.865
<v Josh Sparkes>Directly out of our bank account so that
on the day that the debit comes out of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/407-1
01:28:29.865 --> 01:28:34.750
<v Josh Sparkes>our account, the invoices get sent to AP.
So we still have to process the invoice</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/407-2
01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:37.907
<v Josh Sparkes>as a charge.
So you do that much respectively on the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/407-3
01:28:37.907 --> 01:28:41.660
<v Josh Sparkes>back of this activity, yes. So we do,
the invoice comes to us.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/408-0
01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:47.413
<v Josh Sparkes>From Pexa directly from an external,
we still have to process that invoice as</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/408-1
01:28:47.413 --> 01:28:51.505
<v Josh Sparkes>soon as it comes in,
but the invoice approval side of things</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/408-2
01:28:51.505 --> 01:28:54.927
<v Josh Sparkes>actually happens in the pexa portal
itself, right?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/408-3
01:28:54.927 --> 01:28:56.940
<v Josh Sparkes>So we don't need any approval.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/410-0
01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:00.910
<v Josh Sparkes>On that invoice,
it's already all of those fees have been</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/410-1
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:05.712
<v Josh Sparkes>approved through online portal and then
we don't have to physically pay it or</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/410-2
01:29:05.712 --> 01:29:10.329
<v Josh Sparkes>pull it into a payment batch like already
debited out of our bank account.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/410-3
01:29:10.329 --> 01:29:14.700
<v Josh Sparkes>So we just have to manually mark that as
pay. So managing the request.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/411-0
01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:17.470
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So,
Mark and seeing you're on the call,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/411-1
01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:21.541
<v Josh Sparkes>so that that is an e-mail address,
that's something we could pick up as a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/411-2
01:29:21.541 --> 01:29:25.392
<v Josh Sparkes>because it's always paper,
always kind of in the same e-mail address.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/411-3
01:29:25.392 --> 01:29:28.583
<v Josh Sparkes>It's an automated e-mail.
So you can get that task. Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/411-4
01:29:28.583 --> 01:29:33.149
<v Josh Sparkes>I just think the workflow is going to be
slightly different because it's not going</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/411-5
01:29:33.149 --> 01:29:34.580
<v Josh Sparkes>to have to go through any.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/412-0
01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:38.065
<v Josh Sparkes>Approval or payment approval that apply
for it.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/412-1
01:29:38.065 --> 01:29:42.233
<v Josh Sparkes>It can bypass based on the fact that
these rules are for Texas.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/412-2
01:29:42.233 --> 01:29:46.661
<v Josh Sparkes>So basically is new. Yeah. Closed.
Approved. Close. Complete. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/412-3
01:29:46.661 --> 01:29:51.480
<v Josh Sparkes>You're just going through. Yeah.
There's no notifications that we have to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/412-4
01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:54.020
<v Josh Sparkes>give anyone that it's there because in.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/413-0
01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:57.585
<v Josh Sparkes>Internally,
we have a policy that has to be processed</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/413-1
01:29:57.585 --> 01:30:00.675
<v Josh Sparkes>within one to two business days of
receiving it.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/413-2
01:30:00.675 --> 01:30:05.467
<v Josh Sparkes>Because of our direct debit policy.
So the fees get added to a legal matter</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/413-3
01:30:05.467 --> 01:30:08.746
<v Josh Sparkes>within a day or two of that invoice
coming through.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/413-4
01:30:08.746 --> 01:30:13.223
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's no follow-ups for.
I need this on the bill or anything like</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/413-5
01:30:13.223 --> 01:30:13.980
<v Josh Sparkes>that either.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/414-0
01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:17.869
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a pretty straight it's pretty
straightforward,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/414-1
01:30:17.869 --> 01:30:21.812
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's just not going to have all the
additional means we can. We can,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/414-2
01:30:21.812 --> 01:30:24.622
<v Josh Sparkes>it's it's going to have the same work
those states,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/414-3
01:30:24.622 --> 01:30:28.079
<v Josh Sparkes>but we you're going to take out all the
little bit essentially.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/414-4
01:30:28.079 --> 01:30:32.401
<v Josh Sparkes>So when you get that so which effectively
you're effectively getting a task and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/414-5
01:30:32.401 --> 01:30:33.860
<v Josh Sparkes>then what do you do on the?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/415-0
01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:39.305
<v Josh Sparkes>In so it's now you just have to mark it.
It's assigned to somebody action it in</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/415-1
01:30:39.305 --> 01:30:41.340
<v Josh Sparkes>three E close it. That's it. OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/416-0
01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:49.735
<v Josh Sparkes>So the other workflow didn't have action
free and some requests for payment.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/416-1
01:30:49.735 --> 01:30:54.267
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that the same sort of state that you
would have? So you'd have new?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/416-2
01:30:54.267 --> 01:30:57.139
<v Josh Sparkes>It's already been, yeah.
There's no payment.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/416-3
01:30:57.139 --> 01:31:00.140
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe it could be new whip,
which is your app.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/417-0
01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:04.871
<v Josh Sparkes>Actionable thing and then close approved.
Close. Complete. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/417-1
01:31:04.871 --> 01:31:09.019
<v Josh Sparkes>Why are you doing that thing? Yeah,
we've got similar in the UK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/417-2
01:31:09.019 --> 01:31:13.614
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got a hospitality con.
Catered costs that come on, right. So him.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/417-3
01:31:13.614 --> 01:31:17.954
<v Josh Sparkes>But they're internal costs.
They just need to be booked through the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/417-4
01:31:17.954 --> 01:31:20.060
<v Josh Sparkes>the GL code or the matter number.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/418-0
01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:23.937
<v Josh Sparkes>So when that comes in,
that's just getting processed on to the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/418-1
01:31:23.937 --> 01:31:27.891
<v Josh Sparkes>system doesn't need to go for approval.
And once the process that just gets</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/418-2
01:31:27.891 --> 01:31:30.388
<v Josh Sparkes>closed,
it's not getting paid because it's just</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/418-3
01:31:30.388 --> 01:31:33.509
<v Josh Sparkes>internal cost that we need to watch on
the system recently.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/418-4
01:31:33.509 --> 01:31:37.723
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that done much effectively as well.
So do you get the requests coming in from</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/418-5
01:31:37.723 --> 01:31:38.140
<v Josh Sparkes>anybody?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/419-0
01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:44.134
<v Josh Sparkes>Weekly from the Ask Connect team.
I think as I believe they send it over on</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/419-1
01:31:44.134 --> 01:31:47.518
<v Josh Sparkes>a weekly basis,
but we do have a schedule progress coming</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/419-2
01:31:47.518 --> 01:31:52.185
<v Josh Sparkes>in to share wheel just now and make sure
that we upload it because we should be</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/419-3
01:31:52.185 --> 01:31:56.094
<v Josh Sparkes>getting a weekly file just to make sure
that all the costs are on.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/419-4
01:31:56.094 --> 01:31:59.420
<v Josh Sparkes>For one thing for billing purposes and
things like that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/420-0
01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:01.611
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's scheduled that I need to contact
you.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/420-1
01:32:01.611 --> 01:32:04.744
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm thinking is that something we can
look at in the future? Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/420-2
01:32:04.744 --> 01:32:07.363
<v Josh Sparkes>they seem to fail.
We rely on them to think of the file</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/420-3
01:32:07.363 --> 01:32:09.794
<v Josh Sparkes>every week. So,
but we've just set up the scheduled</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/420-4
01:32:09.794 --> 01:32:13.535
<v Josh Sparkes>request to make sure that we get that
file just in case that for whatever needs</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/420-5
01:32:13.535 --> 01:32:16.014
<v Josh Sparkes>and falls down.
But they could send that through the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/420-6
01:32:16.014 --> 01:32:18.820
<v Josh Sparkes>portal, couldn't they?
All that details through the portal.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/422-0
01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:22.222
<v Josh Sparkes>As well as you're getting all some pets
automatic.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/422-1
01:32:22.222 --> 01:32:25.183
<v Josh Sparkes>You're getting the e-mail that can be
picked up,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/422-2
01:32:25.183 --> 01:32:28.748
<v Josh Sparkes>but you're getting that internally from
ask Connect. Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/422-3
01:32:28.748 --> 01:32:32.978
<v Josh Sparkes>And we can combine that on.
You've got connects on London what's used</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/422-4
01:32:32.978 --> 01:32:36.121
<v Josh Sparkes>for Monday,
I think going back to the portal thing,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/422-5
01:32:36.121 --> 01:32:38.780
<v Josh Sparkes>we do have specific suppliers that we
will.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/423-0
01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:43.310
<v Josh Sparkes>And then to the portal to download the
invoices. We don't get them sent direct,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/423-1
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:47.831
<v Josh Sparkes>so we again have got scheduled for quite
a fun to make sure we go into the portal</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/423-2
01:32:47.831 --> 01:32:51.304
<v Josh Sparkes>and download them and then you can
generate the requests. Yes,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/423-3
01:32:51.304 --> 01:32:55.660
<v Josh Sparkes>we would generate it and then it was
always the normal invoice processing and.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/424-0
01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:57.260
<v Josh Sparkes>Right, good.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/425-0
01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:01.260
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a few variations of that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/426-0
01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:08.074
<v Josh Sparkes>Bulk invoice long PO mechanism and then
there's ones that you extract from the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/426-1
01:33:08.074 --> 01:33:12.904
<v Josh Sparkes>from various portals that you then
thought that process and you have a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/426-2
01:33:12.904 --> 01:33:18.482
<v Josh Sparkes>scheduled request that you pulled for the
future calendar events that we can come</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/426-3
01:33:18.482 --> 01:33:21.340
<v Josh Sparkes>upon that become part of your task matrix.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/427-0
01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:26.260
<v Josh Sparkes>An activity in ServiceNow? Yeah,
because it also happens for our our</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/427-1
01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:30.193
<v Josh Sparkes>provider as well.
Their invoices don't get sent to us into</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/427-2
01:33:30.193 --> 01:33:35.593
<v Josh Sparkes>share rail. They go through a portal.
So then voices get automatically uploaded.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/427-3
01:33:35.593 --> 01:33:40.793
<v Josh Sparkes>But we do have scheduled replace and
share rail just now to make sure that we</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/427-4
01:33:40.793 --> 01:33:41.460
<v Josh Sparkes>make sure.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/428-0
01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:45.087
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got the files and we can go ahead
and check just to map.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/428-1
01:33:45.087 --> 01:33:49.196
<v Josh Sparkes>Make sure that if they copy us and on an
e-mail that they've sent to the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/428-2
01:33:49.196 --> 01:33:51.843
<v Josh Sparkes>integrations team for the file to be
uploaded.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/428-3
01:33:51.843 --> 01:33:56.347
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have got we get that and we hold
that and we've got scheduled release and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/428-4
01:33:56.347 --> 01:33:58.880
<v Josh Sparkes>share,
we'll just stay just so that when the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/428-5
01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:01.020
<v Josh Sparkes>file comes in, we can then go into it.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/429-0
01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:05.402
<v Josh Sparkes>To check just to make sure it's game over
and that all the invoices are there.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/429-1
01:34:05.402 --> 01:34:08.016
<v Josh Sparkes>Because as I was saying earlier,
these come in,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/429-2
01:34:08.016 --> 01:34:10.521
<v Josh Sparkes>they should automatically fall to the
vendor,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/429-3
01:34:10.521 --> 01:34:14.877
<v Josh Sparkes>but for any reason because they had an
upload, if there's any issues with them,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/429-4
01:34:14.877 --> 01:34:19.016
<v Josh Sparkes>they'll go into the action list and
anybody in the business could pick them</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/429-5
01:34:19.016 --> 01:34:19.180
<v Josh Sparkes>up.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/430-0
01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:24.563
<v Josh Sparkes>So when it comes for us to do the monthly
reconciliation to make sure we've got the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/430-1
01:34:24.563 --> 01:34:28.695
<v Josh Sparkes>right invoices on to pay,
it could be that we are missing files and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/430-2
01:34:28.695 --> 01:34:32.766
<v Josh Sparkes>it's because someone's already picked
them up and sitting on them.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/430-3
01:34:32.766 --> 01:34:37.809
<v Josh Sparkes>So to try and stop that when we get these
weekly files and we're trying to do that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/430-4
01:34:37.809 --> 01:34:38.660
<v Josh Sparkes>at that stage.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/431-0
01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:41.901
<v Josh Sparkes>So that we know well the fails came in
today.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/431-1
01:34:41.901 --> 01:34:45.203
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have that so that we can try and
create that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/431-2
01:34:45.203 --> 01:34:49.966
<v Josh Sparkes>So it comes to that and we can run that
insight that you're missing number</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/431-3
01:34:49.966 --> 01:34:54.856
<v Josh Sparkes>decreases over you know if you utopia
that there is nothing missing based on</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/431-4
01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:58.540
<v Josh Sparkes>these schedules that you're running that
can be adjusted.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/432-0
01:34:58.700 --> 01:34:59.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Any other portals?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/433-0

<v Josh Sparkes>I'm sure everything that's been paid.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/434-0

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/434-1

<v Josh Sparkes>equation?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/435-0
01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:36.819
<v Josh Sparkes>Those invoices should be coming through
sets centrally through knife, right?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/435-1
01:35:36.819 --> 01:35:41.993

01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:03.533
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what Cindy's meaning is,
that we're moving to a process that not</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/436-3

01:36:35.504 --> 01:36:41.620
<v Josh Sparkes>If you follow the process that's similar
to what Australia is doing globally then.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/439-0
01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:47.549
<v Josh Sparkes>We get the all of the property invoices
on the like two or three days before the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/439-1
01:36:47.549 --> 01:36:51.537
<v Josh Sparkes>end of the month.
We process them on the first day of the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/439-2
01:36:51.537 --> 01:36:54.975
<v Josh Sparkes>month.
We pay them on the first day of the month,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/439-3
01:36:54.975 --> 01:37:00.545
<v Josh Sparkes>but they're coming from 1 central place,
so Australia 30 days later on that same</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/439-4
01:37:00.545 --> 01:37:00.820
<v Josh Sparkes>day.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/440-0
01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:06.246
<v Josh Sparkes>First day,
so I might get the invoices through on</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/440-1
01:37:06.246 --> 01:37:10.665
<v Josh Sparkes>the 27th of October.
Legit the payment on the 1st of November,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/440-2
01:37:10.665 --> 01:37:13.820
<v Josh Sparkes>but they're all coming from 1 central
place,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/440-3
01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:18.660
<v Josh Sparkes>so at the moment the company that manages
the Australian properties.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/441-0
01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:23.339
<v Josh Sparkes>Source all of the invoices,
consolidate it and then tell us what we</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/441-1
01:37:23.339 --> 01:37:27.834
<v Josh Sparkes>need to pay and that's that's essentially
what night Frank is going to do for</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/441-2
01:37:27.834 --> 01:37:31.235
<v Josh Sparkes>everyone globally.
So they will source and consolidate all</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/441-3
01:37:31.235 --> 01:37:35.500
<v Josh Sparkes>of the invoices relevant to each property
and give it to us in one batch.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/442-0
01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:38.300
<v Josh Sparkes>So here the legal process it goes to.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/443-0
01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:43.453
<v Josh Sparkes>Accounts payable at that point,
not localised,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/443-1
01:37:43.453 --> 01:37:47.673
<v Josh Sparkes>I can't quite remember whether it's going
to be localised for teaming.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/443-2
01:37:47.673 --> 01:37:50.763
<v Josh Sparkes>What I'm saying is if they're doing a
global state,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/443-3
01:37:50.763 --> 01:37:55.399
<v Josh Sparkes>are they consolidating all the invoices
for that entire property portfolio or</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/443-4
01:37:55.399 --> 01:37:59.500
<v Josh Sparkes>they're separating it by? Yeah,
that's still go to the local office.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/444-0
01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:06.233
<v Josh Sparkes>It is OK, it's a global level. Yeah, yeah.
Australia will night.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/444-1
01:38:06.233 --> 01:38:11.817
<v Josh Sparkes>Frank has teams in relevant for each
location that we're in. So night, Frank.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/444-2
01:38:11.817 --> 01:38:17.186
<v Josh Sparkes>They'll be night, Frank. Australia.
They'll still only send the Australian</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/444-3
01:38:17.186 --> 01:38:19.620
<v Josh Sparkes>stuff to me, and then the UK team.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/445-0
01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:23.826
<v Josh Sparkes>And you will get the properties that
they're supposed to be looking after,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/445-1
01:38:23.826 --> 01:38:28.326
<v Josh Sparkes>but we only should worry about them, OK.
And then probably a bit like these hexa</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/445-2
01:38:28.326 --> 01:38:32.660
<v Josh Sparkes>ones that they're always coming from
night, Frank is inquest, yes similar to.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/446-0
01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:40.673
<v Josh Sparkes>What we discussed again that we could
pick up those e-mail extensions, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/446-1
01:38:40.673 --> 01:38:46.222
<v Josh Sparkes>And then trigger the task. Yeah.
I think it'll follow similar workflow to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/446-2
01:38:46.222 --> 01:38:50.646
<v Josh Sparkes>a non PO invoice,
but it should be if we can flag you know</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/446-3
01:38:50.646 --> 01:38:54.620
<v Josh Sparkes>those VIP suppliers or VIP vendors,
Frank should be.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/447-0
01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:59.739
<v Josh Sparkes>The VIP. Yeah,
I assume this is a very short term thing.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/447-1
01:38:59.739 --> 01:39:05.337
<v Josh Sparkes>It's gonna happen soon. This change.
I think we're in the next six months. OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/447-2
01:39:05.337 --> 01:39:08.455
<v Josh Sparkes>All right. Yeah. Cool in scope. Yeah.
Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/447-3
01:39:08.455 --> 01:39:13.769
<v Josh Sparkes>it'll we should have well and truly
implemented this part about time we're</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/447-4
01:39:13.769 --> 01:39:14.620
<v Josh Sparkes>rolling out.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/448-0
01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:17.260
<v Josh Sparkes>Service now that was the question. Yeah.
Thank you.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/449-0
01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:22.260
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, we've done the power of the effects.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/450-0
01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:29.580
<v Josh Sparkes>Tax RIP tax and all the ones that come
from portals, utilities.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/451-0
01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:41.893
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's done. I think so, yeah.
And then I'll last but not least,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/451-1
01:39:41.893 --> 01:39:43.540
<v Josh Sparkes>expense management.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/452-0
01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:50.389
<v Josh Sparkes>Which there is another you before we
start on the expense management,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/452-1
01:39:50.389 --> 01:39:56.134
<v Josh Sparkes>can we just add one more question to the
list with our travel travel provider?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/452-2
01:39:56.134 --> 01:39:59.333
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So that's more to do with the queries</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/452-3
01:39:59.333 --> 01:40:01.660
<v Josh Sparkes>that we get around the invoices.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/453-0
01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:05.986
<v Josh Sparkes>Luna, like Luna,
mentioned that we get a file imported</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/453-1
01:40:05.986 --> 01:40:11.887
<v Josh Sparkes>directly into 3E by one of our IT teams,
so the invoices don't necessarily touch</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/453-2
01:40:11.887 --> 01:40:16.623
<v Josh Sparkes>AP until they hit 3 E,
But because that's only done on a monthly</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/453-3
01:40:16.623 --> 01:40:17.060
<v Josh Sparkes>basis.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/454-0
01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:23.884
<v Josh Sparkes>We get a number of queries or requests
from the business to allocate or</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/454-1
01:40:23.884 --> 01:40:30.713
<v Josh Sparkes>reallocate invoices to a particular
course that allocated and will travel to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/454-2
01:40:30.713 --> 01:40:34.260
<v Josh Sparkes>a specific area or specific team in the.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/455-0
01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:39.244
<v Josh Sparkes>Travel portal and then when time comes
down to invoicing,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/455-1
01:40:39.244 --> 01:40:44.763
<v Josh Sparkes>they need it to be moved somewhere else.
So if there's a way that it's not in the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/455-2
01:40:44.763 --> 01:40:49.744
<v Josh Sparkes>MPL right now because it was only
implemented a couple of years ago after</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/455-3
01:40:49.744 --> 01:40:54.523
<v Josh Sparkes>we kind of finalised our MPL,
but if we could look at what any kind of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/455-4
01:40:54.523 --> 01:40:54.860
<v Josh Sparkes>form.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/456-0
01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:58.240
<v Josh Sparkes>On ServiceNow would look like for for the
'cause,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/456-1
01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:01.729
<v Josh Sparkes>it's only gonna be internal queries like
Asha's. Mm-hmm.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/456-2
01:41:01.729 --> 01:41:05.462
<v Josh Sparkes>So for people to kind of put in what
their queries are sent,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/456-3
01:41:05.462 --> 01:41:10.420
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we have a note for the. Yeah,
the sound query that we're coding queries.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/457-0
01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:16.476
<v Josh Sparkes>Up a lot across all,
so Mark here probably talked with myself,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/457-1
01:41:16.476 --> 01:41:22.845
<v Josh Sparkes>but that whole query will be a
standardised offering of which that would</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/458-0
01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:26.405
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, you'd the target. You know,
the target would be the cross ask you</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/457-2
01:41:22.845 --> 01:41:23.980
<v Josh Sparkes>be a success.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/458-1
01:41:26.405 --> 01:41:31.026
<v Mark Sedge>have kind of one form where they buy
different tick parameters with rooted to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/458-2
01:41:31.026 --> 01:41:34.463
<v Mark Sedge>the right teens based upon you.
A little quick, you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/458-3
01:41:34.463 --> 01:41:37.129
<v Mark Sedge>what's your query to do with is it
payments,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/458-4
01:41:37.129 --> 01:41:40.980
<v Mark Sedge>is it this is it that depending on what
they tick and then what?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/460-0
01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:46.671
<v Mark Sedge>And get you know.
And then bless you to the said Sneezer.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/460-1
01:41:46.671 --> 01:41:51.311
<v Mark Sedge>Sorry, Joe. Couldn't help it. Yeah,
so we would.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/460-2
01:41:51.311 --> 01:41:58.318
<v Mark Sedge>We would expect to create a single form
and then by selection of from the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/459-0
01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:53.020
<v Josh Sparkes>They weren't something.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/460-3
01:41:58.318 --> 01:42:00.780
<v Mark Sedge>audience selection rooted.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/461-0
01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:02.100
<v Mark Sedge>To the appropriate team.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/462-0
01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:09.429
<v Josh Sparkes>Really comes up across any of the
functional,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/462-1
01:42:09.429 --> 01:42:15.558
<v Josh Sparkes>so that's the ask that we'll have that
ask as a general as a standardised</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/462-2
01:42:15.558 --> 01:42:17.380
<v Josh Sparkes>offering. That's good.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/463-0
01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:23.740
<v Josh Sparkes>But you want to make sure we capture that
as a type of query, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/467-0
01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:30.306
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. Josh,
what we'll probably need to do as a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/467-1
01:42:30.306 --> 01:42:33.513
<v Mark Sedge>collective,
I think it pretty much sit down and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/467-2
01:42:33.513 --> 01:42:38.123
<v Mark Sedge>review all of the things that are likely
to come through that route.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/466-0
01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:35.940
<v Josh Sparkes>Hello.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/467-3
01:42:38.123 --> 01:42:43.200
<v Mark Sedge>What would be the appropriate tick list
or pick list and what would be your</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/467-4
01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:46.140
<v Mark Sedge>resultant sort of text asks that we'd
want.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/470-0
01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:50.985
<v Mark Sedge>Audience to populate to enabled us to get
the best information into support.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/470-1
01:42:50.985 --> 01:42:55.975
<v Mark Sedge>So we probably need to just join up with
Hannah, etcetera to make sure that yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/470-2
01:42:55.975 --> 01:42:59.140
<v Mark Sedge>we've got something sensible that works
across all.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/469-0
01:42:56.980 --> 01:42:57.380
<v Josh Sparkes>All right.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/472-0
01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:04.758
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that. That's what much of this is.
As you'll you'll see on on this next</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/472-1
01:43:04.758 --> 01:43:07.460
<v Josh Sparkes>section. But yeah, I want to get into it.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/471-0
01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:08.500
<v Mark Sedge>Cool.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/473-0
01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:12.320
<v Josh Sparkes>This is the these are all query query
query.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/473-1
01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:17.626
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah you know probably falls into that.
So maybe I mean maybe this is a good</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/473-2
01:43:17.626 --> 01:43:21.210
<v Josh Sparkes>discussion point that I understand that
you're not.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/473-3
01:43:21.210 --> 01:43:25.620
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm taking this that you're not my
expenses comes up next week.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/474-0
01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:32.917
<v Josh Sparkes>As a discussion, but we've taken these,
these are the queries associated even the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/474-1
01:43:32.917 --> 01:43:39.088
<v Josh Sparkes>expenses process that you're going to be
going through next week is like the front</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/474-2
01:43:39.088 --> 01:43:45.036
<v Josh Sparkes>end of this like where you're actually
coding and submitting the expense in our</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/474-3
01:43:45.036 --> 01:43:45.780
<v Josh Sparkes>system AP.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/475-0
01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:50.592
<v Josh Sparkes>Role is the back end where we're
reviewing those expenses and we've got a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/475-1
01:43:50.592 --> 01:43:53.693
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow for that.
But the majority of stuff, yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/475-2
01:43:53.693 --> 01:43:58.582
<v Josh Sparkes>the majority of stuff that comes into our
inbox is definitely queries or requests</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/475-3
01:43:58.582 --> 01:44:01.563
<v Josh Sparkes>or chases. OK,
so do we want to maybe give you an</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/475-4
01:44:01.563 --> 01:44:05.380
<v Josh Sparkes>overview of your back end posting them to
enter my own parking?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/476-0
01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:09.201
<v Josh Sparkes>So you know for next week it also joins
out,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/476-1
01:44:09.201 --> 01:44:15.732
<v Josh Sparkes>OK how that triggers start so so I've got
power expense management system inverse,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/476-2
01:44:15.732 --> 01:44:22.263
<v Josh Sparkes>there's nothing to trigger AP looking up.
We just know that we have to be in there</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/476-3
01:44:22.263 --> 01:44:24.860
<v Josh Sparkes>every single day we will open up.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/477-0
01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:29.325
<v Josh Sparkes>All of the reports that are expenses that
have been submitted for review,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/477-1
01:44:29.325 --> 01:44:32.118
<v Josh Sparkes>we will review it from a financial
perspective.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/477-2
01:44:32.118 --> 01:44:37.005
<v Josh Sparkes>So make sure that all of the information
is correct. The tax is reported correctly,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/477-3
01:44:37.005 --> 01:44:40.380
<v Josh Sparkes>receipts and whatnot and once we're happy
with it and we.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/478-0
01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:47.362
<v Josh Sparkes>Push it through the workflows once it
goes through the workflows there's like</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/478-1
01:44:47.362 --> 01:44:54.196
<v Josh Sparkes>three data feeds on a 24 hour period that
goes from inverse into 3A so our reports</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/478-2
01:44:54.196 --> 01:44:56.420
<v Josh Sparkes>get automatically imported.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/479-0
01:44:56.700 --> 01:45:02.817
<v Josh Sparkes>In 2-3 for us and they pop up on that
action list that one has spoken about.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/479-1
01:45:02.817 --> 01:45:08.856
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have to pick those up, correct.
Any errors might pop up and then post</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/479-2
01:45:08.856 --> 01:45:14.100
<v Josh Sparkes>them then post them into 3E.
And that's the extent of what we do.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/480-0
01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:19.774
<v Josh Sparkes>The additional step on that is managing
staff reimbursements.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/480-1
01:45:19.774 --> 01:45:25.768
<v Josh Sparkes>So AP Australia pay staff any
reimbursements due on a weekly basis and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/480-2
01:45:25.768 --> 01:45:30.580
<v Josh Sparkes>you can do it all nightly.
Would you guys do weekly too?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/481-0
01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:34.999
<v Josh Sparkes>Weekly. Yeah. OK.
So that payment process is pretty much</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/481-1
01:45:34.999 --> 01:45:40.217
<v Josh Sparkes>exactly the same across our teams too.
The main that's probably what that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/481-2
01:45:40.217 --> 01:45:41.980
<v Josh Sparkes>process is in a nutshell.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/482-0
01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:49.513
<v Josh Sparkes>Actually, yeah.
So while that you captured as well that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/482-1
01:45:49.513 --> 01:45:55.019
<v Josh Sparkes>you get these queries and which then they
probably come along with this sort of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/482-2
01:45:55.019 --> 01:45:58.528
<v Josh Sparkes>free reform that we get.
But we'll do such a bond,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/482-3
01:45:58.528 --> 01:46:03.139
<v Josh Sparkes>you know like coding query reallocation,
scheduled requests issue.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/482-4
01:46:03.139 --> 01:46:04.860
<v Josh Sparkes>You know there's lots of.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/483-0
01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:09.067
<v Josh Sparkes>Different things in there.
So I think that becomes a content again</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/483-1
01:46:09.067 --> 01:46:13.853
<v Josh Sparkes>query type form that goes into you and
based on that mutual remarks what's like</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/483-2
01:46:13.853 --> 01:46:18.459
<v Josh Sparkes>the logic that comes part of the fact
that it falls into AP because it's the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/483-3
01:46:18.459 --> 01:46:22.646
<v Josh Sparkes>expense, all expense queries,
I think that's the first pass land with</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/483-4
01:46:22.646 --> 01:46:24.740
<v Josh Sparkes>yourself accounts payable. OK yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/484-0
01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:29.196
<v Josh Sparkes>We it has to start with us.
There might be occasion that we have to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/484-1
01:46:29.196 --> 01:46:33.787
<v Josh Sparkes>direct it to a different team,
but we would then determine whether it's</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/484-2
01:46:33.787 --> 01:46:38.952
<v Josh Sparkes>appropriate or not to move it to like our
financial systems team is would be the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/484-3
01:46:38.952 --> 01:46:42.460
<v Josh Sparkes>next port of call.
If we can't troubleshoot something.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/485-0
01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:43.940
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/486-0
01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:48.032
<v Mark Sedge>And now in that situation,
would you would you expect those guys to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/486-1
01:46:48.032 --> 01:46:52.410
<v Mark Sedge>be working with service now,
so you can just pass the ticket straight</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/486-2
01:46:52.410 --> 01:46:57.351
<v Mark Sedge>to their group or their queue or would
you raise it with them but you hold the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/486-3
01:46:57.351 --> 01:46:59.540
<v Mark Sedge>ticket to manage and keep sight of?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/487-0
01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:04.365
<v Josh Sparkes>I I'm assuming that they're part of,
they're going to be part of the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/487-1
01:47:04.365 --> 01:47:06.789
<v Josh Sparkes>ServiceNow group.
They're technically part of IT.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/487-2
01:47:06.789 --> 01:47:09.020
<v Josh Sparkes>So financial assistance,
application support.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/488-0
01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:12.705
<v Mark Sedge>Oh, OK. The so it's the IT group. Yeah,
100. But that's cool. Perfect. Yeah. OK,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/489-0
01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:14.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, I'm.
I'm quite sure they should be falling</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/488-1
01:47:12.705 --> 01:47:13.220
<v Mark Sedge>very good.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/489-1
01:47:14.937 --> 01:47:19.300
<v Josh Sparkes>under the IT because they can't really
show. Well. Yeah, so I can't.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/491-0
01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:21.101
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, very. No.
That's I didn't forgive me.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/491-1
01:47:21.101 --> 01:47:24.209
<v Mark Sedge>I didn't clock that.
They were the IT techies. So yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/490-0
01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:23.500
<v Josh Sparkes>This is.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/491-2
01:47:24.209 --> 01:47:24.820
<v Mark Sedge>no worries.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/492-0
01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:29.026
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So it would be good to just be able to do</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/492-1
01:47:29.026 --> 01:47:34.060
<v Josh Sparkes>like a really straightforward transfer.
Yeah, I think, yeah, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/493-0
01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:34.598
<v Mark Sedge>Yes. So, Josh, what we would need to do,
Josh,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/493-1
01:47:34.598 --> 01:47:39.123
<v Mark Sedge>what we would need to do there is make
sure that it's it's triggered across you</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/493-2
01:47:39.123 --> 01:47:41.895
<v Mark Sedge>know, when it goes across to them that it,
yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/493-3
01:47:41.895 --> 01:47:46.420
<v Mark Sedge>we need to just make sure how it lands in
the ITSM because it's if it's a case.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/495-0
01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:50.798
<v Mark Sedge>They may not work on a case,
so we might need to think when it needs</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/494-0
01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:49.460
<v Josh Sparkes>Hmm.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/495-1
01:47:50.798 --> 01:47:54.101
<v Mark Sedge>to go across the you know,
these that maybe it's a task that's</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/495-2
01:47:54.101 --> 01:47:57.038
<v Mark Sedge>triggered and then they respond to a task
or something.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/495-3
01:47:57.038 --> 01:47:59.660
<v Mark Sedge>So we just need to think about how they
get that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/497-0
01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:04.258
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, we need to map the whole thing.
Yeah. Mark,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/496-0
01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:02.980
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/497-1
01:48:04.258 --> 01:48:10.283
<v Josh Sparkes>is that specific for transfer of requests
into IT or is that just thinking about</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/497-2
01:48:10.283 --> 01:48:14.820
<v Josh Sparkes>how we would need to move requests or
transfer any requests?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/499-0
01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:18.530
<v Josh Sparkes>Between any different teams,
because that's something else,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/498-0
01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:17.380
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/499-1
01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:22.817
<v Josh Sparkes>Laura and I've spoken about where it is
very common amongst finance to get</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/499-2
01:48:22.817 --> 01:48:27.162
<v Josh Sparkes>requests. That's not for us and we have,
it's for us to just transfer it in</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/501-0
01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:28.243
<v Mark Sedge>I'm looking.
I'm looking across all all all. Yes.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/499-3
01:48:27.162 --> 01:48:27.620
<v Josh Sparkes>between.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/501-1
01:48:28.243 --> 01:48:32.593
<v Mark Sedge>Sorry. Sorry to talk over you.
The the I'm looking at all permutations</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/500-0
01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:28.780
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/501-2
01:48:32.593 --> 01:48:35.840
<v Mark Sedge>of that. Right.
So it could be a mirrored request or</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/501-3
01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:40.067
<v Mark Sedge>something that comes in or it or it could
be, you know, a, you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/501-4
01:48:40.067 --> 01:48:44.540
<v Mark Sedge>a task that you just need action in.
I'll see parrots go his hand again.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/502-0
01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:45.260
<v Mark Sedge>Ahead parikh.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/504-0
01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:49.871
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, Mark, on that point,
I think for in the HR sessions,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/504-1
01:48:49.871 --> 01:48:53.386
<v Parik Narain>we discussed the concept of universal
request, which is there.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/503-0
01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:53.180
<v Mark Sedge>Yes.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/504-2
01:48:53.386 --> 01:48:57.794
<v Parik Narain>So Universal request is supposed to be
applied to any part of the organisation</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/504-3
01:48:57.794 --> 01:49:01.700
<v Parik Narain>and then others can can join in,
whether it's HR or legal or finance.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/505-0
01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:05.441
<v Parik Narain>So perhaps we can take it back and
explore this in line with the universal</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/506-0
01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:09.540
<v Mark Sedge>Well, what, yeah, 100%. Sorry, go on.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/505-1
01:49:05.441 --> 01:49:06.180
<v Parik Narain>request concept.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/507-0
01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:10.482
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry,
I was just is this a case of where it's</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/507-1
01:49:10.482 --> 01:49:16.167
<v Josh Sparkes>been incorrectly assigned to you and
you're giving it back to the right person</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/507-2
01:49:16.167 --> 01:49:22.140
<v Josh Sparkes>or is it part of the workflow that it's
going to another member of because of the?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/509-0
01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:23.009
<v Mark Sedge>It it could be both.
I think The thing is it could be both,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/507-3
01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:22.500
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/509-1
01:49:23.009 --> 01:49:25.699
<v Mark Sedge>right?
So it could be that a request comes in</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/509-2
01:49:25.699 --> 01:49:29.735
<v Mark Sedge>and needs IT to do something.
It needs another team to do something,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/509-3
01:49:29.735 --> 01:49:32.777
<v Mark Sedge>etcetera.
And therefore you have the parallel task.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/508-0
01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:31.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/509-4
01:49:32.777 --> 01:49:37.046
<v Mark Sedge>But the point is that Parrot's
highlighting is it's a single routine and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/509-5
01:49:37.046 --> 01:49:38.860
<v Mark Sedge>therefore multitude of results.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/511-0
01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:43.605
<v Mark Sedge>Can pick up the activity,
but we also need to look at those that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/510-0
01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:42.620
<v Parik Narain>Correct, correct.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/511-1
01:49:43.605 --> 01:49:47.895
<v Mark Sedge>have been generated through, you know,
the ITSM kind of route.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/511-2
01:49:47.895 --> 01:49:53.069
<v Mark Sedge>But what we're you know as a specific
item be they taking it from a call or</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/511-3
01:49:53.069 --> 01:49:56.882
<v Mark Sedge>something like that.
And then what happens if they need</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/511-4
01:49:56.882 --> 01:49:58.380
<v Mark Sedge>support in, in or out?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/512-0
01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:02.146
<v Mark Sedge>Of you know, across the teams.
So that's what we've got our minds.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/512-1
01:50:02.146 --> 01:50:04.837
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
it's certainly on our radar and we just</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/512-2
01:50:04.837 --> 01:50:08.820
<v Mark Sedge>need to look at the typical occurrences
and then see how they're treated.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/513-0
01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:13.248
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I'm thinking more along the lines of when</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/513-1
01:50:13.248 --> 01:50:19.311
<v Josh Sparkes>a workflow move has to move from accounts
payable to another team or I think from</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/513-2
01:50:19.311 --> 01:50:25.300
<v Josh Sparkes>in my area it's most commonly going in
between cashier's and accounts payable or</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/513-3
01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:27.740
<v Josh Sparkes>accounts payable and insist team.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/515-0
01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:33.535
<v Josh Sparkes>At the I mean at the moment we have a
decent amount of emails that come to us.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/515-1
01:50:33.535 --> 01:50:36.995
<v Josh Sparkes>That's not for us,
but that's because someone isn't sure</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/514-0
01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:36.540
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/515-2
01:50:36.995 --> 01:50:39.848
<v Josh Sparkes>where to go,
so they send a billing request to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/515-3
01:50:39.848 --> 01:50:43.248
<v Josh Sparkes>accounts payable.
We just have to move it across to the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/515-4
01:50:43.248 --> 01:50:46.101
<v Josh Sparkes>right team.
I think with the implementation of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/515-5
01:50:46.101 --> 01:50:47.740
<v Josh Sparkes>ServiceNow that's going to.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/517-0
01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:53.501
<v Josh Sparkes>To heavily reduce that because you will
be able to know if someone puts in the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/516-0
01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:50.300
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/517-1
01:50:53.501 --> 01:50:57.387
<v Josh Sparkes>word billing,
you're directing that to the correct team</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/517-2
01:50:57.387 --> 01:51:01.134
<v Josh Sparkes>and for them.
So that's I'm not as concerned with the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/517-3
01:51:01.134 --> 01:51:05.506
<v Josh Sparkes>incorrect classifications.
I'm more thinking about the ongoing</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/517-4
01:51:05.506 --> 01:51:07.380
<v Josh Sparkes>workflows. Yep, the normal.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/518-0
01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:10.795
<v Josh Sparkes>Process.
I think we have one of them where they're</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/518-1
01:51:10.795 --> 01:51:15.774
<v Josh Sparkes>going to go to finance management or if
it is that is able to reassign. Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/518-2
01:51:15.774 --> 01:51:19.221
<v Josh Sparkes>based on that,
it looks actually in that the workflow</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/518-3
01:51:19.221 --> 01:51:24.008
<v Josh Sparkes>you can you can do that maybe maybe
possibly though when you're in a state</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/518-4
01:51:24.008 --> 01:51:25.860
<v Josh Sparkes>for example, if it lies with.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/519-0
01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:30.947
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe it's balances and cheques.
If it is with accounts payable for this</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/519-1
01:51:30.947 --> 01:51:35.234
<v Josh Sparkes>particular state from A to B,
you can't reassign it because you've set</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/519-2
01:51:35.234 --> 01:51:38.313
<v Josh Sparkes>the rules.
That actually is part of your task that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/519-3
01:51:38.313 --> 01:51:41.573
<v Josh Sparkes>you're doing,
but it's when it changed states it will</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/519-4
01:51:41.573 --> 01:51:45.860
<v Josh Sparkes>say. I realise that you're changing it,
it automatically says. I know.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/520-0
01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:50.799
<v Josh Sparkes>Going to finance management for this and
therefore it will do that for you. So you,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/520-1
01:51:50.799 --> 01:51:53.846
<v Josh Sparkes>you're not necessarily changing the
assignment group,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/520-2
01:51:53.846 --> 01:51:56.780
<v Josh Sparkes>it will do that part of you for the
workflow, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/521-0
01:51:57.860 --> 01:51:58.500
<v Mark Sedge>Go on parrot.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/522-0
01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:13.780
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/525-0
01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:18.180
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good point.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/524-0
01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:16.540
<v Parik Narain>Let us know if there's anything like that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/523-0
01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:15.380
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/528-0
01:52:17.260 --> 01:52:21.771
<v Mark Sedge>We're so we're so on the same page pack
because my next comment was going to be</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/528-1
01:52:21.771 --> 01:52:25.549
<v Mark Sedge>in some instance it might be that you in,
if you need some action,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/528-2
01:52:25.549 --> 01:52:29.045
<v Mark Sedge>you keep the record,
but you initiate a specific task to that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/528-3
01:52:29.045 --> 01:52:32.767
<v Mark Sedge>team to go take that action.
Then you also see when they close it</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/527-0
01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:30.340
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/528-4
01:52:32.767 --> 01:52:36.940
<v Mark Sedge>because you get notified that that task
is done and it's associated with.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/529-0
01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:40.018
<v Mark Sedge>The record,
but they can't necessarily view the full</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/529-1
01:52:40.018 --> 01:52:41.180
<v Mark Sedge>content of the record.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/530-0
01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:43.220
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, that's right. That's right, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/531-0
01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:47.703
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, definitely.
I think we still follow those rules just</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/531-1
01:52:47.703 --> 01:52:51.246
<v Josh Sparkes>in regular e-mail now anyway.
So if that could be built in,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/532-0
01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:53.814
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.
And if it's something like Sid's team or</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/531-2
01:52:51.246 --> 01:52:52.900
<v Josh Sparkes>that's extra safety measure.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/532-1
01:52:53.814 --> 01:52:57.476
<v Mark Sedge>security team, again,
they might have greater rights to see</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/532-2
01:52:57.476 --> 01:53:00.650
<v Mark Sedge>stuff then, you know, you know,
A and other normal,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/532-3
01:53:00.650 --> 01:53:05.227
<v Mark Sedge>normal IT team for example. So again,
each of these what we can do is work</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/532-4
01:53:05.227 --> 01:53:09.500
<v Mark Sedge>through the context, work through the,
you know, the permissions and.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/533-0
01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:13.948
<v Mark Sedge>Through the controls within service,
now we can limit what they can see,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/533-1
01:53:13.948 --> 01:53:18.372
<v Mark Sedge>but ultimately what you want to be able
to do is launch a task to them and get</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/533-2
01:53:18.372 --> 01:53:22.572
<v Mark Sedge>something back from them to say they've
done it so that you can continue a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/533-3
01:53:22.572 --> 01:53:23.020
<v Mark Sedge>process.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/534-0
01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:26.196
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
and equally powerful as you sort of say</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/534-1
01:53:26.196 --> 01:53:30.158
<v Josh Sparkes>from the time groups of what they can see
and what they can change, you know.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/534-2
01:53:30.158 --> 01:53:33.612
<v Josh Sparkes>So the fact that you they can see
something like me that you might,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/534-3
01:53:33.612 --> 01:53:37.675
<v Josh Sparkes>it's got information and you don't want
to edit it but you they could also have</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/534-4
01:53:37.675 --> 01:53:40.012
<v Josh Sparkes>that.
So you've got seeing editing maintained</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/534-5
01:53:40.012 --> 01:53:43.060
<v Josh Sparkes>you know those types of rules associated
with those groups.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/536-0
01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:48.273
<v Josh Sparkes>And with the original request,
I'll be able to see that process like the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/536-1
01:53:48.273 --> 01:53:51.389
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow.
So if someone has sent accounts payable a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/536-2
01:53:51.389 --> 01:53:56.362
<v Josh Sparkes>query and we're having to pass that on to
insist from an additional action because</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/536-3
01:53:56.362 --> 01:53:57.860
<v Josh Sparkes>we can't do it ourselves.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/538-0
01:53:58.340 --> 01:54:02.020
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that original requested going to be
able to see that transfer of?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/538-1
01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:05.326
<v Josh Sparkes>If you want again,
if that's part of the notification figure,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/538-2
01:54:05.326 --> 01:54:07.993
<v Josh Sparkes>it's more in sleep,
then they can see that. Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/538-3
01:54:07.993 --> 01:54:12.046
<v Josh Sparkes>it would definitely be more from a
perspective of just visibility for us to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/537-0
01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:08.300
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/538-4
01:54:12.046 --> 01:54:15.140
<v Josh Sparkes>be able to say, yeah,
we need to go into finsis for this.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/539-0
01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:19.544
<v Josh Sparkes>And they can physically see that it has
on fences. It's dealing with fences,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/539-1
01:54:19.544 --> 01:54:23.651
<v Josh Sparkes>and there's not much we can do to push it.
But they know that it's been actioned by</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/541-0
01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:26.257
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
one one of the things you might look at</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/539-2
01:54:23.651 --> 01:54:25.460
<v Josh Sparkes>someone else right now as well, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/541-1
01:54:26.257 --> 01:54:31.014
<v Mark Sedge>doing is when you do a transfer,
when you initiate a task for another team</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/540-0
01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:27.420
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/541-2
01:54:31.014 --> 01:54:36.214
<v Mark Sedge>that it is possible. And again the guys,
the guys will sort of work this through,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/541-3
01:54:36.214 --> 01:54:41.161
<v Mark Sedge>but it's possible to put a customer
viewable comment in your notes as well as</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/541-4
01:54:41.161 --> 01:54:42.620
<v Mark Sedge>a normal sort of notes.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/542-0
01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:46.945
<v Mark Sedge>But when you're transferring it,
you could be automatically triggered to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/542-1
01:54:46.945 --> 01:54:51.567
<v Mark Sedge>put in a note for the customer to tell
you what you're doing with that record to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/542-2
01:54:51.567 --> 01:54:54.991
<v Mark Sedge>keep them informed.
So you've got a number of ways of doing</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/542-3
01:54:54.991 --> 01:54:57.615
<v Mark Sedge>it.
It's just a question of how much you want</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/542-4
01:54:57.615 --> 01:55:01.553
<v Mark Sedge>that. Yeah. And obviously,
I'm assuming that you're thinking that so</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/542-5
01:55:01.553 --> 01:55:02.580
<v Mark Sedge>you don't get any.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/543-0
01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:05.185
<v Mark Sedge>Further calls with someone's going what
happens with this?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/543-1
01:55:05.185 --> 01:55:08.260
<v Mark Sedge>You want to be able to tell them up front
so they know where it's going.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/544-0
01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:12.140
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, definitely, I think the.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/545-0
01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:20.274
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm getting too excited. Yeah,
the main the main piece is just</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/545-1
01:55:20.274 --> 01:55:25.064
<v Josh Sparkes>communication.
Like we because all of those requests are</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/545-2
01:55:25.064 --> 01:55:31.620
<v Josh Sparkes>coming through to us as an e-mail.
It's easy for us to just communicate back.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/547-0
01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:35.853
<v Josh Sparkes>But yeah, I can't do this.
I need to think it's someone else,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/546-0
01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:33.540
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/547-1
01:55:35.853 --> 01:55:40.775
<v Josh Sparkes>but if it's triggered automatically or if
everything's kind of done through a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/547-2
01:55:40.775 --> 01:55:45.445
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow having some kind of comment or
communication that is sent to the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/547-3
01:55:45.445 --> 01:55:49.169
<v Josh Sparkes>original request to say this had to go on
to someone else,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/547-4
01:55:49.169 --> 01:55:51.820
<v Josh Sparkes>or even if it's a free text field that we.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/550-0
01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:55.728
<v Josh Sparkes>Can put our own personalised message back
to them just to keep them up to date,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/548-0
01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:54.300
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/550-1
01:55:55.728 --> 01:55:59.269
<v Josh Sparkes>so they haven't aren't having to rely
themselves on always going into the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/550-2
01:55:59.269 --> 01:56:01.422
<v Josh Sparkes>portal to see the status because I can
tell.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/550-3
01:56:01.422 --> 01:56:05.298
<v Josh Sparkes>I know that that would get frustrating if
they're feeling like they're having to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/550-4
01:56:05.298 --> 01:56:07.500
<v Josh Sparkes>constantly chase up without hearing
anything.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/549-0
01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:06.580
<v Mark Sedge>Yes.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/551-0
01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:10.420
<v Mark Sedge>Makes sense?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/552-0
01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:14.273
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just going to ask that we will need
to discuss that from an ask perspective</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/552-1
01:56:14.273 --> 01:56:18.687
<v Josh Sparkes>as well and there will be anomalies where
we might need to do something different</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/552-2
01:56:18.687 --> 01:56:22.831
<v Josh Sparkes>depending on the stakeholder group and
the personas that we're dealing with.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/552-3
01:56:22.831 --> 01:56:25.361
<v Josh Sparkes>But we we will try for a level of
consistency.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/552-4
01:56:25.361 --> 01:56:28.860
<v Josh Sparkes>So depending on whether you're a partner
or AP or somebody else.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/553-0
01:56:29.140 --> 01:56:32.069
<v Josh Sparkes>Finance or whatever.
If you're in a particular persona,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/553-1
01:56:32.069 --> 01:56:32.540
<v Josh Sparkes>we might.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/554-0
01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:35.860
<v Josh Sparkes>So what I'm trying to see.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/557-0
01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:41.402
<v Josh Sparkes>What was machine thought like that tape?
What kind of notifications of weight and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/555-0
01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:42.100
<v Mark Sedge>You you like where you can deviate from
the yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/557-1
01:56:41.402 --> 01:56:43.561
<v Josh Sparkes>stuff like that.
You know where you can have some</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/557-2
01:56:43.561 --> 01:56:45.807
<v Josh Sparkes>deviations in there.
It's Mark's just going to see.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/556-0
01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:44.980
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/557-3
01:56:45.807 --> 01:56:48.615
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's something that we will discuss on
a wider piece as well.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/557-4
01:56:48.615 --> 01:56:51.380
<v Josh Sparkes>And then just tie in with everyone around
what that looks like.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/558-0
01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:57.039
<v Mark Sedge>But it's a point well made. You do you.
You do want to be able to communicate</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/558-1
01:56:57.039 --> 01:56:57.940
<v Mark Sedge>with your audience.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/559-0
01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:06.352
<v Josh Sparkes>Is the biggest pain point of our state
all this? Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/559-1
01:57:06.352 --> 01:57:09.243
<v Josh Sparkes>They just want over communication,
you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/559-2
01:57:09.243 --> 01:57:13.611
<v Josh Sparkes>and service now is excellent about that.
Workflow states, you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/559-3
01:57:13.611 --> 01:57:18.300
<v Josh Sparkes>notifications updating you where e-mail
doesn't currently, so it's good.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/560-0
01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:20.820
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, so we did four expenses.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/562-0
01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:19.860
<v Mark Sedge>Play song.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/563-0
01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:23.267
<v Mark Sedge>The tricky part, sorry team,
just one thought right.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/561-0
01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:23.300
<v Josh Sparkes>This one.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/563-1
01:57:23.267 --> 01:57:28.478
<v Mark Sedge>The tricky part of this is your audience
want to be communicated with when they're</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/563-2
01:57:28.478 --> 01:57:33.062
<v Mark Sedge>wanting and they've got the need,
but they don't want to be communicated</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/563-3
01:57:33.062 --> 01:57:36.703
<v Mark Sedge>with when it's when,
it's just normal flow and that's the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/563-4
01:57:36.703 --> 01:57:39.780
<v Mark Sedge>hardest part to philtre out to ensure
that they.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/564-0
01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:43.300
<v Mark Sedge>See the right things that they need to go
on Joey again.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/565-0
01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:47.934
<v Josh Sparkes>I guess as well Mark,
there is an option that I'm forgetting.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/565-1
01:57:47.934 --> 01:57:51.686
<v Josh Sparkes>You can see us.
I'm guessing there is an option though,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/565-2
01:57:51.686 --> 01:57:56.912
<v Josh Sparkes>like we can obviously configure the
workflow to have particular notifications</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/565-3
01:57:56.912 --> 01:58:00.530
<v Josh Sparkes>at particular times.
But if you want to send a manual</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/565-4
01:58:00.530 --> 01:58:02.540
<v Josh Sparkes>notification, you can do that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/569-0
01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:05.253
<v Josh Sparkes>That right part of the case,
you can add a note.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/566-0
01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:04.940
<v Mark Sedge>Yes, yeah, we.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/569-1
01:58:05.253 --> 01:58:09.487
<v Josh Sparkes>You're dealing with a particular partner
that you know wants to be communicated</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/567-0
01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:10.580
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, client visible notes.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/569-2
01:58:09.487 --> 01:58:12.399
<v Josh Sparkes>all the time.
So you give that update and it's more of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/569-3
01:58:12.399 --> 01:58:15.839
<v Josh Sparkes>that bespoke service.
So I think it's just getting that balance,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/569-4
01:58:15.839 --> 01:58:18.380
<v Josh Sparkes>right. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
we'll show you how to.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/568-0
01:58:16.660 --> 01:58:16.980
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/571-0
01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:22.396
<v Josh Sparkes>Add a note that stays internal.
Add a note that goes to the customer.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/571-1
01:58:22.396 --> 01:58:25.496
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll show you a notification as a on on
that as well. Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/570-0
01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:22.660
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/571-2
01:58:25.496 --> 01:58:28.700
<v Josh Sparkes>so you can set that linking service that
you want to provide.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/573-0
01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:31.425
<v Mark Sedge>And what you and again depending on the
process there is the you know as I talked</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/573-1
01:58:31.425 --> 01:58:34.877
<v Mark Sedge>about earlier,
there is a view that says you could do an</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/573-2
01:58:34.877 --> 01:58:38.026
<v Mark Sedge>override.
So if you said don't send a notification,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/573-3
01:58:38.026 --> 01:58:42.810
<v Mark Sedge>you could you could you could default it
to send and then you can untick a box</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/573-4
01:58:42.810 --> 01:58:46.020
<v Mark Sedge>maybe and then you won't over transmit if
you don't.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/572-0
01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:44.540
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/574-0
01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:49.816
<v Mark Sedge>And it needs to.
We can look at various routes to enable</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/574-1
01:58:49.816 --> 01:58:53.980
<v Mark Sedge>you to, you know manage when you launch,
when you don't etcetera.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/575-0
01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:55.780
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/576-0
01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:03.904
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes. So on this one is, as we said,
I think we've discovered that modelling</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/576-1
01:59:03.904 --> 01:59:08.836
<v Josh Sparkes>of that enterprise wide query principle
that they go to for anything of which</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/576-2
01:59:08.836 --> 01:59:14.020
<v Josh Sparkes>expense queries lies within that remit.
So I think that is a wide discussion that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/576-3
01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:17.940
<v Josh Sparkes>rest assured that based on you know
within 3 clicks or three.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/577-0
01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:23.183
<v Josh Sparkes>Two bits of information that their query
will be recreated and sent,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/577-1
01:59:23.183 --> 01:59:29.292
<v Josh Sparkes>confined to the right, right audience,
and that will cover these sort of queries</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/577-2
01:59:29.292 --> 01:59:35.023
<v Josh Sparkes>issues to do with their expenses.
One that we did have on the maybe just to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/577-3
01:59:35.023 --> 01:59:37.060
<v Josh Sparkes>discuss with the schedules.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/578-0
01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:42.761
<v Josh Sparkes>Request,
but again a bit like that calendar.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/578-1
01:59:42.761 --> 01:59:46.429
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that something that you do as a
calendar item?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/578-2
01:59:46.429 --> 01:59:51.124
<v Josh Sparkes>I thought need clarification.
I think that was I feel like that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/578-3
01:59:51.124 --> 01:59:54.939
<v Josh Sparkes>potential.
The only thing that that might be linked</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/578-4
01:59:54.939 --> 01:59:56.700
<v Josh Sparkes>to is the reimbursement.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/579-0
01:59:56.780 --> 02:00:03.059
<v Josh Sparkes>The payments that we will process,
there's nothing else run river wise that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/579-1
02:00:03.059 --> 02:00:09.834
<v Josh Sparkes>would be a scheduled request outside of
possibly just a kind of task to say go in</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/579-2
02:00:09.834 --> 02:00:11.900
<v Josh Sparkes>and check your queue and.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/580-0
02:00:12.180 --> 02:00:16.089
<v Josh Sparkes>Chrome river. But we have.
We just know that we have to do that and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/580-1
02:00:16.089 --> 02:00:18.676
<v Josh Sparkes>that would be a hot overall expense
process.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/580-2
02:00:18.676 --> 02:00:23.103
<v Josh Sparkes>This request is part of the checking
process of that, isn't it? It could be.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/580-3
02:00:23.103 --> 02:00:27.357
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't think I've ever used a scheduled
request for Chrome River though.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/580-4
02:00:27.357 --> 02:00:29.140
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what I think that's why.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/581-0
02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:34.633
<v Josh Sparkes>Like Laura and I have kind of said that
we're not really sure what that's meaning</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/581-1
02:00:34.633 --> 02:00:39.061
<v Josh Sparkes>because we don't really use it.
That's why I'm. I'm just thinking, yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/581-2
02:00:39.061 --> 02:00:43.853
<v Josh Sparkes>it would only be in a maybe relative to
either the payment run to remind us to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/581-3
02:00:43.853 --> 02:00:44.460
<v Josh Sparkes>run it or.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/582-0
02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:49.683
<v Josh Sparkes>To as a daily reminder to check to be
going into a ribbon and review the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/582-1
02:00:49.683 --> 02:00:52.840
<v Josh Sparkes>expense,
and this might be one that you I know</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/582-2
02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:58.347
<v Josh Sparkes>that soon you picked up some things that
when the processes that actually needed,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/582-3
02:00:58.347 --> 02:01:03.654
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean some of the media clarification
but actually from that clarification of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/582-4
02:01:03.654 --> 02:01:04.460
<v Josh Sparkes>NA you know.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/583-0
02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:07.238
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I think it it,
it doesn't make sense.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/583-1
02:01:07.238 --> 02:01:11.808
<v Josh Sparkes>It's making extra work for us to have a
daily scheduled request to tell us to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/583-2
02:01:11.808 --> 02:01:14.621
<v Josh Sparkes>check.
Currently we need to have mails to check</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/583-3
02:01:14.621 --> 02:01:18.254
<v Josh Sparkes>and just need to see if it's currently
run it and share well,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/583-4
02:01:18.254 --> 02:01:22.180
<v Josh Sparkes>it may be something that was created and
it's not getting running.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/584-0
02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:32.009
<v Josh Sparkes>It could have been was as when we go to
their payment runs we used to do a</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/584-1
02:01:32.009 --> 02:01:35.483
<v Josh Sparkes>complete expense check before the payment
runs.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/584-2
02:01:35.483 --> 02:01:40.768
<v Josh Sparkes>That was a scheduled request or cool,
never to make sure that we weren't</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/584-3
02:01:40.768 --> 02:01:44.460
<v Josh Sparkes>captured.
Anything that maybe we put through size.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/585-0
02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:48.566
<v Josh Sparkes>That report isn't working, just say so.
It's we're not doing it, just say,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/585-1
02:01:48.566 --> 02:01:52.290
<v Josh Sparkes>but it might have been picked up from
that. Yeah, but the scheduled request,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/585-2
02:01:52.290 --> 02:01:55.046
<v Josh Sparkes>though, comes in just now.
So that's what that could be.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/585-3
02:01:55.046 --> 02:01:58.673
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be not part of our payment run
cheques that which we talked about</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/585-4
02:01:58.673 --> 02:01:59.060
<v Josh Sparkes>earlier.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/586-0
02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:01.700
<v Josh Sparkes>Could be, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/587-0
02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:12.340
<v Josh Sparkes>We've definitely got one for check auto
loads and CR duplicate report before</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/587-1
02:02:12.340 --> 02:02:16.692
<v Josh Sparkes>payment on that one,
and then we've got another one for Chrome</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/587-2
02:02:16.692 --> 02:02:22.012
<v Josh Sparkes>River staff expenses which is staff
personal spending options that's I think</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/587-3
02:02:22.012 --> 02:02:25.260
<v Josh Sparkes>that's the only ones underneath Chrome
rivers.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/588-0
02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:34.300
<v Josh Sparkes>That experience is perfect. OK, slightly.
That's that one again, that's good.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/590-0
02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:39.456
<v Josh Sparkes>All right.
I think that's it for processes. Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/590-1
02:02:39.456 --> 02:02:43.753
<v Josh Sparkes>processes. I mean unbelievably,
I think there was 72 one. Yeah,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/590-2
02:02:43.753 --> 02:02:49.124
<v Josh Sparkes>one processes that we got through today
that we've consolidated into these five</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/590-3
02:02:49.124 --> 02:02:51.340
<v Josh Sparkes>services. That was a lot of work.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/591-0
02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:52.260
<v Josh Sparkes>None.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/592-0
02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:54.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Hello.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/593-0
02:02:56.060 --> 02:03:00.242
<v Josh Sparkes>Again, I want to reiterate,
it certainly doesn't trivialise the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/593-1
02:03:00.242 --> 02:03:04.883
<v Josh Sparkes>amount of work that gets done,
and I suppose on you know in ServiceNow</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/593-2
02:03:04.883 --> 02:03:09.327
<v Josh Sparkes>speak you know you're looking at the
efficiency of these processes,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/593-3
02:03:09.327 --> 02:03:13.706
<v Josh Sparkes>improving your processes.
You probably like to sort of just end on</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/593-4
02:03:13.706 --> 02:03:15.340
<v Josh Sparkes>sort of some terminology.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/594-0
02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:18.752
<v Josh Sparkes>And so it's now just like the three seats.
But you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/594-1
02:03:18.752 --> 02:03:22.974
<v Josh Sparkes>just because in the past it also comments
on the fact that it's complete,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/594-2
02:03:22.974 --> 02:03:27.482
<v Josh Sparkes>but it also moves forward improving the
health because you've got more time to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/594-3
02:03:27.482 --> 02:03:32.047
<v Josh Sparkes>spend because you're not, you're not,
you're not tied up in this administrative</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/594-4
02:03:32.047 --> 02:03:34.900
<v Josh Sparkes>world of emails,
it's sort of a bit like anybody.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/595-0
02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:38.433
<v Josh Sparkes>Got more time?
We get more healthy and a bit like this.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/595-1
02:03:38.433 --> 02:03:43.072
<v Josh Sparkes>This actually will then move it from
being just complete to being correct to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/595-2
02:03:43.072 --> 02:03:47.590
<v Josh Sparkes>be in compliance and you know that's the
heavy lifting of the advantage of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/595-3
02:03:47.590 --> 02:03:49.940
<v Josh Sparkes>ServiceNow. So you get to add you know.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/596-0
02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:55.010
<v Josh Sparkes>All the added value that comes from
freeing up your time of not doing the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/596-1
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:58.151
<v Josh Sparkes>admin work that's doing since now seeing
that view.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/596-2
02:03:58.151 --> 02:04:02.380
<v Josh Sparkes>But to improve the help of all your
processes and applications, yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/597-0
02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:07.280
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so I'm definitely gonna wrap up before 5.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/597-1
02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:12.065
<v Josh Sparkes>Use a couple of housekeeping things.
It's gonna be super, super quick,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/597-2
02:04:12.065 --> 02:04:14.020
<v Josh Sparkes>and then we'll let you go so.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/598-0
02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:18.488
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
but the heavy lifting is definitely done.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/598-1
02:04:18.488 --> 02:04:23.012
<v Josh Sparkes>I still might need to be in this view,
so it's all about prioritising we can't</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/598-2
02:04:23.012 --> 02:04:26.734
<v Josh Sparkes>automate and mature high, you know,
high automation, everything.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/598-3
02:04:26.734 --> 02:04:29.598
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll get everything across in terms of
services,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/598-4
02:04:29.598 --> 02:04:34.351
<v Josh Sparkes>but we just need to prioritise what's the
most impactful thing across the whole of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/598-5
02:04:34.351 --> 02:04:34.580
<v Josh Sparkes>ask.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/599-0
02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:39.863
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have a little formula that we're
asking everybody across ask.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/599-1
02:04:39.863 --> 02:04:44.524
<v Josh Sparkes>We've already got volume metrics.
So but we take the volume of a service,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/599-2
02:04:44.524 --> 02:04:49.626
<v Josh Sparkes>then we need to gather the value of a
service. We've already had a stab at that,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/599-3
02:04:49.626 --> 02:04:54.540
<v Josh Sparkes>but I'm just going to ask if you guys can
just have a look at what we ranked.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/600-0
02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:58.953
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the value of the services and it's
based on these things here.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/600-1
02:04:58.953 --> 02:05:02.075
<v Josh Sparkes>So let me zoom in.
So by the value of a service,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/600-2
02:05:02.075 --> 02:05:07.109
<v Josh Sparkes>we mean if we can automate it highly,
then it would do these things very well,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/600-3
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:11.060
<v Josh Sparkes>reduce errors, decrease processing times,
improve compliance.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/601-0
02:05:11.540 --> 02:05:17.360
<v Josh Sparkes>Avoid duplicate entry, etcetera. Well,
that stuff makes sense if we can automate</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/601-1
02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:22.605
<v Josh Sparkes>it, then we achieve those things.
So some of the kind of rough estimates</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/601-2
02:05:22.605 --> 02:05:27.420
<v Josh Sparkes>that we've done and ignore the volume
please because consolidated.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/602-0
02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:33.355
<v Josh Sparkes>But we thought if we could focus on
manage invoice for example, it's highly,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/602-1
02:05:33.355 --> 02:05:37.455
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know if you guys know Fibonacci,
it's just a rating.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/602-2
02:05:37.455 --> 02:05:42.900
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's just like a rating between one
and 21. It's just a way that you can say.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/603-0
02:05:43.260 --> 02:05:46.368
<v Josh Sparkes>It's highly impactful or it's not
impactful at all,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/603-1
02:05:46.368 --> 02:05:50.971
<v Josh Sparkes>but I wouldn't worry too much about it.
Would you say that manage invoice is</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/603-2
02:05:50.971 --> 02:05:55.335
<v Josh Sparkes>probably the most impactful thing there
if we could spend most well time</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/603-3
02:05:55.335 --> 02:05:58.682
<v Josh Sparkes>automating that,
whereas that managing expenses we just</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/603-4
02:05:58.682 --> 02:05:59.460
<v Josh Sparkes>talked about?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/604-0
02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:04.620
<v Josh Sparkes>You know it's it's difficult to automate
because it's an ad hoc queries,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/604-1
02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:07.540
<v Josh Sparkes>but if we're going to focus on manage
invoices.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/605-0
02:06:10.540 --> 02:06:14.332
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it's hard to.
That is important just now.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/605-1
02:06:14.332 --> 02:06:20.652
<v Josh Sparkes>But with the new P2P roll out as well,
that could be changing the way we handle</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/605-2
02:06:20.652 --> 02:06:27.288
<v Josh Sparkes>the invoices that might not come directly
might go through a portal to do that now.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/605-3
02:06:27.288 --> 02:06:29.500
<v Josh Sparkes>So it is important just now.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/606-0
02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:34.132
<v Josh Sparkes>But being in mind other things that are
going to be, I mean,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/606-1
02:06:34.132 --> 02:06:38.795
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know how that's going to if
that's going to change the way that it</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/606-2
02:06:38.795 --> 02:06:43.831
<v Josh Sparkes>works to so because it's really the way
it's going through share well and stuff.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/606-3
02:06:43.831 --> 02:06:46.380
<v Josh Sparkes>Just so it's a lot of our tasks but that.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/607-0
02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:52.307
<v Josh Sparkes>We had to go down a different route for
that with all the new projects we've got</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/607-1
02:06:52.307 --> 02:06:57.528
<v Josh Sparkes>coming on and that got taken away then
that part isn't going to be as big about</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/607-2
02:06:57.528 --> 02:07:02.228
<v Josh Sparkes>to look at. That makes sense.
So it's hard to see what's the best thing</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/607-3
02:07:02.228 --> 02:07:06.340
<v Josh Sparkes>until if that makes sense,
then we've got the managed payment.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/608-0
02:07:06.380 --> 02:07:09.704
<v Josh Sparkes>Which is clearly yeah, key. You know,
at the end of the day,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/608-1
02:07:09.704 --> 02:07:13.356
<v Josh Sparkes>you have to make that payment and,
you know, request the payments.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/608-2
02:07:13.356 --> 02:07:17.607
<v Josh Sparkes>So how you're managing your invoices in
the first half of the life, you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/608-3
02:07:17.607 --> 02:07:20.060
<v Josh Sparkes>the workflow is still a subset that that
is.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/609-0
02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:25.993
<v Josh Sparkes>Managing the payments within that so and
that for reputation you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/609-1
02:07:25.993 --> 02:07:29.193
<v Josh Sparkes>make sure our payments,
make sure we're paying,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/609-2
02:07:29.193 --> 02:07:34.326
<v Josh Sparkes>make sure our bills are paid that I
assume there's a high high value item to</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/609-3
02:07:34.326 --> 02:07:37.460
<v Josh Sparkes>make sure you're paying all our bills on
time.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/610-0
02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:44.619
<v Josh Sparkes>Me the biggest value is going to come
from how much we can control the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/610-1
02:07:44.619 --> 02:07:50.627
<v Josh Sparkes>information that's coming to us now.
Right now everything all everything comes</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/610-2
02:07:50.627 --> 02:07:54.886
<v Josh Sparkes>to us by e-mail.
So it's very much a user input type of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/610-3
02:07:54.886 --> 02:07:57.700
<v Josh Sparkes>situation. So if someone is emailing.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/611-0
02:07:58.460 --> 02:08:04.132
<v Josh Sparkes>To say I want to move this here.
Or can you get this done now or you know</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/611-1
02:08:04.132 --> 02:08:08.501
<v Josh Sparkes>prioritise this,
but they're not actually flagging it as</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/611-2
02:08:08.501 --> 02:08:13.100
<v Josh Sparkes>an urgent query.
There's no way for us to know, so I think.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/612-0
02:08:13.900 --> 02:08:19.628
<v Josh Sparkes>If there's a way that we can and having
the use of forms to really narrow down</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/612-1
02:08:19.628 --> 02:08:25.139
<v Josh Sparkes>what someone is really asking for or
prioritisation set for you if it takes</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/612-2
02:08:25.139 --> 02:08:29.780
<v Josh Sparkes>away that noise for you.
If it does like heavy listings we set.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/613-0
02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:35.090
<v Josh Sparkes>Prevent that volume of emails on the back
of it. Yeah, I think that's all of them.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/613-1
02:08:35.090 --> 02:08:38.726
<v Josh Sparkes>Presumably. Yeah. I mean, I mean,
the volumes in the invoices,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/613-2
02:08:38.726 --> 02:08:43.458
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's the majority of the invoice that
we're going through is correct and it's</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/613-3
02:08:43.458 --> 02:08:48.017
<v Josh Sparkes>going to go through potentially going to
go through our P2P workflows as well.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/613-4
02:08:48.017 --> 02:08:49.980
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a little bit easier for us.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/614-0
02:08:50.060 --> 02:08:53.996
<v Josh Sparkes>To manage our time with. But it's. Yeah,
it's fair.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/614-1
02:08:53.996 --> 02:09:00.053
<v Josh Sparkes>Other people not knowing finance that I
feel that's where a lot of my time gets</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/614-2
02:09:00.053 --> 02:09:01.340
<v Josh Sparkes>spent. All right.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/615-0
02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:02.867
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.
And that's where I was going to ask that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/615-1
02:09:02.867 --> 02:09:06.458
<v Mark Sedge>question, Josh, on the scale,
whether there's the, you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/615-2
02:09:06.458 --> 02:09:09.696
<v Mark Sedge>the the user,
you know how to where's the user sort of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/615-3
02:09:09.696 --> 02:09:12.698
<v Mark Sedge>angle that was just described then.
So if you can,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/615-4
02:09:12.698 --> 02:09:17.114
<v Mark Sedge>if you can take away the bit, you know,
we can focus on where we take away</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/615-5
02:09:17.114 --> 02:09:19.940
<v Mark Sedge>failure demand.
I work like that these guys do.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/617-0
02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:23.431
<v Mark Sedge>Because someone doesn't know,
or someone's chasing or something's not</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/617-1
02:09:23.431 --> 02:09:26.988
<v Mark Sedge>right. That would be really powerful,
because it just buys them a bit of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/617-2
02:09:26.988 --> 02:09:30.984
<v Mark Sedge>headroom to then be able to sort of think
about some of the other stuff and maybe</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/617-3
02:09:30.984 --> 02:09:33.907
<v Mark Sedge>the other things that are coming along,
I don't know. Jill,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/617-4
02:09:33.907 --> 02:09:37.660
<v Mark Sedge>do you see where I'm coming from on that
one? It's the failure demand piece.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/618-0
02:09:38.580 --> 02:09:40.500
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, definitely. I think it is about.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/619-0
02:09:42.660 --> 02:09:46.963
<v Josh Sparkes>Making that a first piece not have to go
backwards in favours all the time.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/619-1
02:09:46.963 --> 02:09:49.964
<v Josh Sparkes>That's really where the value is going to
be driven.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/619-2
02:09:49.964 --> 02:09:54.551
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll have that information and that cuts
across probably all the processes that</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/619-3
02:09:54.551 --> 02:09:57.665
<v Josh Sparkes>injection that trigger points, yeah,
point eventually,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/619-4
02:09:57.665 --> 02:10:00.780
<v Josh Sparkes>what do you get beforehand.
What can I get beforehand?</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/620-0
02:10:01.020 --> 02:10:05.522
<v Josh Sparkes>What could you inform the requester to do?
Through knowledge you know you know you</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/620-1
02:10:05.522 --> 02:10:09.157
<v Josh Sparkes>know upfront is that whole,
I mean that goes across everything you</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/620-2
02:10:09.157 --> 02:10:13.713
<v Josh Sparkes>know more than good behaviour horizontal.
I think it's a bit straight and the right</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/620-3
02:10:13.713 --> 02:10:17.239
<v Josh Sparkes>balance on that right because the forms
can't be massive either.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/620-4
02:10:17.239 --> 02:10:20.820
<v Josh Sparkes>They want to be easy to fill out and
stuff like that. So I think.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/621-0
02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:25.541
<v Josh Sparkes>That's probably where the focus should be
is getting that balance right.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/621-1
02:10:25.541 --> 02:10:30.310
<v Josh Sparkes>That's priority on the input from the
request for initially probably entry</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/621-2
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:33.425
<v Josh Sparkes>points,
more of a horizontal yes than a vertical</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/621-3
02:10:33.425 --> 02:10:37.050
<v Josh Sparkes>got it all right. Insightful. Yeah.
Thank you very much.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/621-4
02:10:37.050 --> 02:10:40.420
<v Josh Sparkes>And last thing we think we spoke a little
bit about.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/622-0
02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:44.615
<v Josh Sparkes>Thoughts early, didn't we?
But we wanted to come in with some things</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/622-1
02:10:44.615 --> 02:10:49.041
<v Josh Sparkes>that we normally think is what good in
this area to present them to you guys.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/622-2
02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:53.693
<v Josh Sparkes>But of course you guys will be in this
day today. So do also shout out any other.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/622-3
02:10:53.693 --> 02:10:56.020
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got some good ones today, you know.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/624-0
02:10:55.420 --> 02:10:59.135
<v Mark Sedge>One of the things just to add,
sorry if I may just quick one of the</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/623-0
02:10:57.100 --> 02:10:57.220
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/624-1
02:10:59.135 --> 02:11:03.670
<v Mark Sedge>things to add on here is also think about
some of the information that although it</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/624-2
02:11:03.670 --> 02:11:07.714
<v Mark Sedge>doesn't necessarily help your operations,
but it gives you data to manage</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/624-3
02:11:07.714 --> 02:11:10.227
<v Mark Sedge>behaviours and provide MI upstream,
you know.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/624-4
02:11:10.227 --> 02:11:14.380
<v Mark Sedge>And I said it's off on yesterday's
session. It's the same thing you've got.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/625-0
02:11:14.940 --> 02:11:19.234
<v Mark Sedge>Your operational dashboards to help you
deal with the throughput of work,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/625-1
02:11:19.234 --> 02:11:23.644
<v Mark Sedge>but then you might also want some
dashboard information that tells you some</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/625-2
02:11:23.644 --> 02:11:27.996
<v Mark Sedge>of the you know some of the trigger
points that cause you effort or rework</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/625-3
02:11:27.996 --> 02:11:30.260
<v Mark Sedge>and things like that that you can then.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/626-0
02:11:30.580 --> 02:11:34.658
<v Mark Sedge>Communicate up to say hey, look,
you know certain partners are behaving</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/626-1
02:11:34.658 --> 02:11:37.208
<v Mark Sedge>like this,
which causes us this or whatever.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/626-2
02:11:37.208 --> 02:11:41.966
<v Mark Sedge>So think about some of that other MI that
would be useful too as we go through this</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/626-3
02:11:41.966 --> 02:11:42.420
<v Mark Sedge>process.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/627-0
02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:46.509
<v Josh Sparkes>We got some of that from root cause you
know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/627-1
02:11:46.509 --> 02:11:49.943
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe they didn't supply you with various
details upfront, you know,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/627-2
02:11:49.943 --> 02:11:53.874
<v Josh Sparkes>but we've captured that and we've got the
daily activity that things are being</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/627-3
02:11:53.874 --> 02:11:58.055
<v Josh Sparkes>reached or about to be breached or needs
to be actioned or as you said the urgency.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/627-4
02:11:58.055 --> 02:12:01.340
<v Josh Sparkes>But I think we captured a lot of that
study that we can showcase.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/628-0
02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:07.113
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah. I think probably in follow up,
we'll lock down full reports and</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/628-1
02:12:07.113 --> 02:12:10.777
<v Josh Sparkes>dashboards.
But something to think about and some of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/628-2
02:12:10.777 --> 02:12:16.100
<v Josh Sparkes>the points that I have touched on, yeah,
we'll follow up on that one in the.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/629-0
02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:21.240
<v Josh Sparkes>Interest of moving forward,
what we're going to be doing next few</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/629-1
02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:24.105
<v Josh Sparkes>things.
One of them writing up user stories over</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/629-2
02:12:24.105 --> 02:12:27.322
<v Josh Sparkes>the coming weeks and we'll refine those
with you guys.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/629-3
02:12:27.322 --> 02:12:32.001
<v Josh Sparkes>This is just an example for me billing
look at the the content there as part of</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/629-4
02:12:32.001 --> 02:12:33.580
<v Josh Sparkes>the process we'll be doing.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/630-0
02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:37.057
<v Josh Sparkes>But this a bit more broadly is is what's
coming up.</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/630-1
02:12:37.057 --> 02:12:41.915
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll be publishing the the summary of
this session in the next coming weeks</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/630-2
02:12:41.915 --> 02:12:45.922
<v Josh Sparkes>when we kind of think that, yeah,
what I say, we commence in 3rd,</v>

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/630-3

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/632-2
02:12:59.999 --> 02:13:04.041

065b13aa-ae31-4504-8138-c56f3abbbe04/632-3
