00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:16.137
<v Josh Sparkes>Actually,
and that's only where my excuse it not</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1046-1
00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:20.677
<v Josh Sparkes>necessarily during the session we go away.
We think as a team we join the dots and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1046-2
00:00:20.677 --> 00:00:24.452
<v Josh Sparkes>then it becomes, as you said, challenging,
challenging, what you do.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1046-3
00:00:24.452 --> 00:00:28.773
<v Josh Sparkes>Hopefully we're going to add that layer
for service now to get to you to the B</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1046-4
00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:31.015
<v Josh Sparkes>role.
But actually there will be another</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1046-5
00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:31.617
<v Josh Sparkes>overlay of.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1047-0
00:00:33.857 --> 00:00:38.211
<v Josh Sparkes>Actually, why don't you do it like this?
You know what we said today is not might</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1047-1
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:41.556
<v Josh Sparkes>not be simply laid out,
but it might be a challenge back into.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1047-2
00:00:41.556 --> 00:00:44.105
<v Josh Sparkes>Have you thought about doing this?
You do this.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1047-3
00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:47.981
<v Josh Sparkes>So even though it has been technical,
it will go away. It will be mould,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1047-4
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:48.937
<v Josh Sparkes>rinsed and washed.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1048-0
00:00:49.377 --> 00:00:56.359
<v Josh Sparkes>Who then land with one service of you.
But you know that's how we will approach</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1048-1
00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.017
<v Josh Sparkes>it as a, as a team.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1049-0
00:01:01.617 --> 00:01:06.819
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you get a request then and the
request is for make master cutting and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1049-1
00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:12.295
<v Josh Sparkes>you make the master cutting that was in
that request and so they also want they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1049-2
00:01:12.295 --> 00:01:17.703
<v Josh Sparkes>come back and they want which is quite
often rates change. How how would that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1049-3
00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:21.057
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's what we're thinking that
discussed it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1050-0
00:01:21.377 --> 00:01:25.109
<v Josh Sparkes>Individually,
but on the request it will be and Mark</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1050-1
00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:30.742
<v Josh Sparkes>will interject is that actually you don't
have to have that one one request one</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1050-2
00:01:30.742 --> 00:01:35.952
<v Josh Sparkes>because you can you don't want one.
You could have this and then actually</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1050-3
00:01:35.952 --> 00:01:40.177
<v Josh Sparkes>this you add add another add another so
you can treat them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1052-0
00:01:40.817 --> 00:01:43.652
<v Josh Sparkes>You know that you're it's being requested
as one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1052-1
00:01:43.652 --> 00:01:48.130
<v Josh Sparkes>You might have different assignment
groups on them, but certainly it could be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1052-2
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.325
<v Josh Sparkes>Actually I want to change this.
I don't want to change this and I want to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1051-0
00:01:48.617 --> 00:01:50.497
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. Yeah, so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1052-3
00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:55.330
<v Josh Sparkes>change, you know?
So you you could have that ability</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1056-0
00:01:55.017 --> 00:01:58.309
<v Mark Sedge>So when you're on those sort on those
sort of requests,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1052-4
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.577
<v Josh Sparkes>upfront that comes in.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1053-0
00:01:57.057 --> 00:01:57.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1056-1
00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:03.070
<v Mark Sedge>you can you can say you know do do you
have a do you do you have another request</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1056-2
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.714
<v Mark Sedge>and when they click yes it presents the
same box, same field,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1056-3
00:02:06.714 --> 00:02:11.182
<v Mark Sedge>it's all same sort of structure where
they select again and then ultimately</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1055-0
00:02:07.777 --> 00:02:08.217
<v Josh Sparkes>Hopefully.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1056-4
00:02:11.182 --> 00:02:14.297
<v Mark Sedge>what happens when they submit you'll get
three down.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1057-0
00:02:14.497 --> 00:02:20.318
<v Mark Sedge>Otentially 3 downstream task activities
so you can solve each one associated with</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1057-1
00:02:20.318 --> 00:02:22.377
<v Mark Sedge>the initial point of contact.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1060-0
00:02:23.137 --> 00:02:25.701
<v Josh Sparkes>Or creatively,
if they're of a similar model,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1058-0
00:02:23.617 --> 00:02:23.857
<v Mark Sedge>Right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1060-1
00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:28.767
<v Josh Sparkes>you might get one request,
but you know it might mark.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1060-2
00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:32.391
<v Josh Sparkes>It might be that you don't get three
because they are a comment,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1059-0
00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:29.217
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1060-3
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:33.617
<v Josh Sparkes>but we can go through.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1062-0
00:02:32.897 --> 00:02:35.509
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, you might just get 1-2 action,
but you'll break.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1062-1
00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:39.309
<v Mark Sedge>You'll you'll have a mechanism to break
them down because one might take you 10</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1062-2
00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.541
<v Mark Sedge>minutes.
One might take you half a day and you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1061-0
00:02:41.177 --> 00:02:41.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1062-3
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Mark Sedge>want to make sure that you're tracking
the start and finish of each sort of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1062-4
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Mark Sedge>activity.
So for your own demand management and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1062-5
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.857
<v Mark Sedge>planning.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1063-0
00:02:48.857 --> 00:02:49.577
<v Mark Sedge>Something to think about.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1064-0
00:02:48.857 --> 00:02:52.271
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that I think that's important. Yeah.
What were you thinking?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1064-1
00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:54.767
<v Josh Sparkes>So is that how so you would want to get
as well?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1064-2
00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:58.843
<v Josh Sparkes>A lot of the requests will come through
and it'll be a subject line will be the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1064-3
00:02:58.843 --> 00:03:01.339
<v Josh Sparkes>matter number,
which is really important for us.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1064-4
00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:05.160
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we'll send that request.
They'll say please make the mark cut in.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1064-5
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.217
<v Josh Sparkes>And please change your currency. Yeah.
Please add the rate.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1066-0
00:03:08.297 --> 00:03:13.904
<v Josh Sparkes>It's you could 3 requests at the moment.
All we can do is select one. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1066-1
00:03:13.904 --> 00:03:17.150
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, really.
You can get that as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1066-2
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.199
<v Josh Sparkes>So they could be add another as another
so you get rates currency and they can be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1065-0
00:03:22.377 --> 00:03:22.777
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1066-3
00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.297
<v Josh Sparkes>individual task of a parent. So that will.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1068-0
00:03:27.897 --> 00:03:31.853
<v Josh Sparkes>Triggered or added. I say this example.
The PES? Yeah. If they're,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1068-1
00:03:31.853 --> 00:03:36.046
<v Josh Sparkes>if they're informing you that they,
they can add another, add another.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1068-2
00:03:36.046 --> 00:03:38.998
<v Josh Sparkes>If you think that's going to be a kind of
change.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1068-3
00:03:38.998 --> 00:03:43.427
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what I was going to be points.
A change I mean are they going to be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1068-4
00:03:43.427 --> 00:03:46.497
<v Josh Sparkes>doing it and how are we enforcing?
I mean it's not.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1070-0
00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:49.995
<v Josh Sparkes>PQM or a ServiceNow question,
but it's more of a management question</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1070-1
00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:53.813
<v Josh Sparkes>that how are you going to enforce that
change and particularly OCM comes over</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1070-2
00:03:53.813 --> 00:03:57.289
<v Josh Sparkes>here as well, yeah, no 100%,
it's something that we definitely need to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1070-3
00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:00.276
<v Josh Sparkes>think of because it's not just a change,
this change for us,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1070-4
00:04:00.276 --> 00:04:03.507
<v Josh Sparkes>it's the whole firm as well,
get them to even go into the portal,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1070-5
00:04:03.507 --> 00:04:06.297
<v Josh Sparkes>it's it's going to be tricky.
It's a change for them so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1069-0
00:04:06.377 --> 00:04:07.297
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, exactly.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1073-0
00:04:07.777 --> 00:04:11.035
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it's definitely something,
but the biggest problem I have is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1073-1
00:04:11.035 --> 00:04:15.023
<v Josh Sparkes>personally like my problem is that we're
not able to track the work done like the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1073-2
00:04:15.023 --> 00:04:18.087
<v Josh Sparkes>capacity model or whatever.
We're not able to do that properly</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1071-0
00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:15.937
<v Mark Sedge>Yep.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1073-3
00:04:18.087 --> 00:04:21.540
<v Josh Sparkes>because if you have one service, I mean,
if you look at the dashboard,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1073-4
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.333
<v Josh Sparkes>what you're saying is on a monthly basis
as well, we are sitting at like 60%.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1072-0
00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:26.377
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1073-5
00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:26.257
<v Josh Sparkes>And do you believe?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1076-0
00:04:26.337 --> 00:04:30.226
<v Josh Sparkes>You're sitting at 60%, yeah, 100%.
And it's a pinpoint for obviously Gerald</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1074-0
00:04:28.497 --> 00:04:29.377
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, exactly.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1076-1
00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:33.348
<v Josh Sparkes>injuries that they are.
But I know for a couple of the other</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1076-2
00:04:33.348 --> 00:04:36.060
<v Josh Sparkes>teams as well.
It's a massive pinpoint when they get</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1076-3
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.154
<v Josh Sparkes>something in and it's maybe got multiple
requests and it's only getting counted</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1076-4
00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:43.839
<v Josh Sparkes>once you're only able to categorise it
once there's no functionality to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1076-5
00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:45.937
<v Josh Sparkes>duplicate split. We did look into it but.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1077-0
00:04:46.377 --> 00:04:50.419
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's just more hassle than it's
worth getting it and now to be honest and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1075-0
00:04:47.217 --> 00:04:47.457
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1077-1
00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.116
<v Josh Sparkes>like you see with the productivity
reports and you know the average handle</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1077-2
00:04:54.116 --> 00:04:57.813
<v Josh Sparkes>time, volumes reports and stuff,
it's not showing accurate and partly it's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1077-3
00:04:57.813 --> 00:05:01.559
<v Josh Sparkes>because of what's coming out of share
will because it will be an additional</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1077-4
00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:05.700
<v Josh Sparkes>responsibility for the PE to select three
different things on three different tasks</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1077-5
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.897
<v Josh Sparkes>and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1079-0
00:05:06.297 --> 00:05:09.354
<v Josh Sparkes>I need.
I need their willingness to do that as</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1079-1
00:05:09.354 --> 00:05:13.906
<v Josh Sparkes>well. I think even if there's,
I think two ways, you know for the PE.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1078-0
00:05:10.097 --> 00:05:10.457
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1079-2
00:05:13.906 --> 00:05:18.914
<v Josh Sparkes>Ideally if they're requesting 234 things
they can do it in the one form that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1079-3
00:05:18.914 --> 00:05:23.401
<v Josh Sparkes>they're sending that comes in,
I think also maybe from like a team's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1079-4
00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:25.937
<v Josh Sparkes>perspective, if there is the option to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1080-0
00:05:26.177 --> 00:05:30.329
<v Josh Sparkes>Duplicate or split and be able to re
categorise to something else so it's</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1080-1
00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:33.920
<v Josh Sparkes>still getting counted,
not just one request, but how many ever.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1080-2
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.296
<v Josh Sparkes>Let's say copy have a a query and the
rate query that comes in and so on that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1080-3
00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:42.448
<v Josh Sparkes>rate query it's got actually multiple
different actions like four or five</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1080-4
00:05:42.448 --> 00:05:42.897
<v Josh Sparkes>actions.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1082-0
00:05:43.377 --> 00:05:47.408
<v Josh Sparkes>That doesn't stop anyone be able to
actually, I hope I've received this,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1082-1
00:05:47.408 --> 00:05:51.826
<v Josh Sparkes>but I'm going to raise and create four or
five different requests so I can then</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1082-2
00:05:51.826 --> 00:05:56.299
<v Josh Sparkes>spit out to my teams. Yeah, you can like,
that's attract how much effort that is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1081-0
00:05:52.177 --> 00:05:52.457
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1082-3
00:05:56.299 --> 00:06:00.164
<v Josh Sparkes>for that. Just one similar advice.
So you've got that that as well if</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1082-4
00:06:00.164 --> 00:06:00.937
<v Josh Sparkes>question good.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1083-0
00:06:01.897 --> 00:06:04.293
<v Josh Sparkes>Easy to do. Yeah, you can have ability.
Just. No.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1083-1
00:06:04.293 --> 00:06:07.216
<v Josh Sparkes>But they don't do it because it's too
much. Hard work. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1083-2
00:06:07.216 --> 00:06:10.187
<v Josh Sparkes>And you might find from day one you still
get that behaviour,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1083-3
00:06:10.187 --> 00:06:13.494
<v Josh Sparkes>but you start to force them.
So we'll actually just to let you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1083-4
00:06:13.494 --> 00:06:15.986
<v Josh Sparkes>I've had to raise that as separate
request for you.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1083-5
00:06:15.986 --> 00:06:20.011
<v Josh Sparkes>So you need to track that separate person.
You'll see that in your inbox and you'll</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1083-6
00:06:20.011 --> 00:06:21.257
<v Josh Sparkes>also you'll see something.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1084-0
00:06:21.417 --> 00:06:25.505
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's to updating century or changing
like matter or to update rate etcetera.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1084-1
00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:27.804
<v Josh Sparkes>So they'll see that separate items in
there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1084-2
00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Josh Sparkes>So they want they probably find that
difficult and an experience that they're</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1084-3
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.878
<v Josh Sparkes>not used to hopefully 90 days down the
line they start to get used to that type</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1084-4
00:06:35.878 --> 00:06:38.535
<v Josh Sparkes>of behaviour.
But again he's kind of thinking about</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1084-5
00:06:38.535 --> 00:06:40.017
<v Josh Sparkes>from changing things as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1085-0
00:06:41.177 --> 00:06:45.705
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, and and and it might, as you said,
it could be that they that's why you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1085-1
00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:50.292
<v Josh Sparkes>probably is Mark is saying that leading
question into it to stop them writing.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1085-2
00:06:50.292 --> 00:06:55.052
<v Josh Sparkes>I want to do the following which actually
looks it, it looks trivial as one line,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1085-3
00:06:55.052 --> 00:06:57.897
<v Josh Sparkes>but actually you receive it and that's 10
tasks.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1086-0
00:06:57.137 --> 00:07:00.058
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. The other thing,
the other thing you can do,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1086-1
00:07:00.058 --> 00:07:02.865
<v Mark Sedge>remember when you open it,
when they open it up,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1086-2
00:07:02.865 --> 00:07:07.275
<v Mark Sedge>you can say look to help us help you.
Please segregate your requests and you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1086-3
00:07:07.275 --> 00:07:10.311
<v Mark Sedge>know you so you can steer them with the
guide notes.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1086-4
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:14.893
<v Mark Sedge>So when they ask what's your first you
know and if they can see add another you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1086-5
00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:16.497
<v Mark Sedge>you you use your intro text.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1087-0
00:07:16.817 --> 00:07:19.368
<v Mark Sedge>To tell them that they'll be splitting it
out.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1087-1
00:07:19.368 --> 00:07:22.842
<v Mark Sedge>So there's there's a lot you can do
within the guide. You know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1087-2
00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Mark Sedge>the guidance as they open the record.
One of the other things, Sandeep,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1087-3
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.301
<v Mark Sedge>to your point about the improvement,
remember,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1087-4
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:33.752
<v Mark Sedge>I think that in you know to innovate and
enhance your processes primary and I was</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1087-5
00:07:33.752 --> 00:07:35.977
<v Mark Sedge>interested to hear when you sort of said.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1088-0
00:07:36.337 --> 00:07:41.306
<v Mark Sedge>The challenge was you can't always see
the scope of your work and what have you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1088-1
00:07:41.306 --> 00:07:44.908
<v Mark Sedge>coming through.
This is almost like a first phase to give</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1088-2
00:07:44.908 --> 00:07:49.939
<v Mark Sedge>you full visibility or as much visibility
of your workload and have MI about the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1088-3
00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:54.597
<v Mark Sedge>pain points to be able to affect
innovation and change because it might be</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1088-4
00:07:54.597 --> 00:07:55.777
<v Mark Sedge>we challenge other.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1089-0
00:07:55.857 --> 00:08:00.468
<v Mark Sedge>Teams to come on board with you,
using ServiceNow to speed up the process</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1089-1
00:08:00.468 --> 00:08:05.016
<v Mark Sedge>or it might be the go through time.
We say actually we can consolidate a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1089-2
00:08:05.016 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Mark Sedge>couple of requests or we can,
you know use ServiceNow to maybe do some</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1089-3
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.802
<v Mark Sedge>auto trigger of other stuff.
You know it's that's the thing that will</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1089-4
00:08:13.802 --> 00:08:15.297
<v Mark Sedge>come I think after your.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1090-0
00:08:15.457 --> 00:08:18.577
<v Mark Sedge>First, immersion in using the tool,
I think.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1091-0
00:08:19.777 --> 00:08:24.041
<v Josh Sparkes>And I'm all for, you know,
like you have mid then you have your</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1091-1
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:27.172
<v Josh Sparkes>professional development reviews twice a
year.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1091-2
00:08:27.172 --> 00:08:32.301
<v Josh Sparkes>You know as a part of the community and
you percentifies them based on their</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1091-3
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:37.231
<v Josh Sparkes>bonus it could be exceeds completing
their request 100 and a few years of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1091-4
00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:37.697
<v Josh Sparkes>portal.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1093-0
00:08:39.537 --> 00:08:44.759
<v Josh Sparkes>As I say I I think it's it's it's not the
service now or like like a development or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1093-1
00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:48.552
<v Josh Sparkes>a or a question. What you guys have,
it's an internal thing,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1093-2
00:08:48.552 --> 00:08:53.650
<v Josh Sparkes>that's a pure mindset thing and I won't
show our way to say that we are always at</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1092-0
00:08:49.897 --> 00:08:50.337
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1093-3
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.577
<v Josh Sparkes>the receiving end and you know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1094-0
00:08:56.377 --> 00:08:59.029
<v Josh Sparkes>I won't be.
I won't be surprised if they don't follow</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1094-1
00:08:59.029 --> 00:09:01.631
<v Josh Sparkes>the process and we still have to pick up
everything,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1094-2
00:09:01.631 --> 00:09:05.609
<v Josh Sparkes>but I think you've got the evidence now
to show that that's the probably the bit</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1094-3
00:09:05.609 --> 00:09:09.341
<v Josh Sparkes>is that you're saying is that if we
separate them as partially but at least</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1094-4
00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:12.975
<v Josh Sparkes>got evidence to show that, yeah.
So and I think I mean it's it's internal</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1094-5
00:09:12.975 --> 00:09:15.577
<v Josh Sparkes>discussion I think and that that's
something strong.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1095-0
00:09:15.657 --> 00:09:20.392
<v Josh Sparkes>Application the standing of the process
training all those things needs to be in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1095-1
00:09:20.392 --> 00:09:20.977
<v Josh Sparkes>our OCMPS.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1096-0
00:09:25.617 --> 00:09:28.585
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
these will be interventions as part of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1096-1
00:09:28.585 --> 00:09:32.212
<v Josh Sparkes>our change plan.
So obviously we we can understand the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1096-2
00:09:32.212 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Josh Sparkes>mindset of the PES and the current team
points and and how ServiceNow impact</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1096-3
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.114
<v Josh Sparkes>their ways of working.
And from that we'll be able to put</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1096-4
00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:45.137
<v Josh Sparkes>certain things in place,
certain interventions to help them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1097-0
00:09:45.177 --> 00:09:50.650
<v Josh Sparkes>And it it will be a phased approach,
so it wouldn't be like suddenly they have</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1097-1
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:56.053
<v Josh Sparkes>to do everything in service now will be
kind of like they start to do certain</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1097-2
00:09:56.053 --> 00:10:01.595
<v Josh Sparkes>requests by service now and and we'll use
certain language to help them see the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1097-3
00:10:01.595 --> 00:10:03.257
<v Josh Sparkes>benefit of self-service.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1098-0
00:10:04.697 --> 00:10:08.049
<v Josh Sparkes>But yeah,
we we will have a whole plan to to manage</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1098-1
00:10:08.049 --> 00:10:12.109
<v Josh Sparkes>all of that. Sorry,
just a question not related to this topic,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1098-2
00:10:12.109 --> 00:10:17.330
<v Josh Sparkes>but what's the plan with OPS like on this?
So when are you guys catching up with</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1098-3
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.295
<v Josh Sparkes>them?
When are you guys kind of like advising</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1098-4
00:10:20.295 --> 00:10:22.937
<v Josh Sparkes>them, training them, but what's the plan?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1099-0
00:10:24.977 --> 00:10:28.558
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm not actually,
should you have anything for OPS like</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1099-1
00:10:28.558 --> 00:10:33.050
<v Josh Sparkes>when I be speaking to them because I
interact with them almost every day.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1099-2
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:37.116
<v Josh Sparkes>So I haven't said anything,
but I just want to make sure that they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1099-3
00:10:37.116 --> 00:10:38.937
<v Josh Sparkes>they know that this is coming.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1101-0
00:10:39.417 --> 00:10:44.180
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we have to build it up, you know,
because it's it's it's an area they they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1101-1
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.772
<v Josh Sparkes>will reject it if you go at the very end.
So there's a there is a communications</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1101-2
00:10:48.772 --> 00:10:51.097
<v Josh Sparkes>planning based which is what happened so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1102-0
00:10:52.057 --> 00:10:56.612
<v Josh Sparkes>Identifying who those stakeholders are,
Simon was only seven days with including</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1102-1
00:10:56.612 --> 00:10:59.198
<v Josh Sparkes>OPS.
We don't always gonna keep stakeholders.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1102-2
00:10:59.198 --> 00:11:02.403
<v Josh Sparkes>We, to be honest,
we start start doing this at that time</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1102-3
00:11:02.403 --> 00:11:06.395
<v Josh Sparkes>now. So consider it, you know,
as different interventions as we start,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1102-4
00:11:06.395 --> 00:11:10.669
<v Josh Sparkes>we start with the right applications.
What's the approach for self-service?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1102-5
00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:11.737
<v Josh Sparkes>What's going to be?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1103-0
00:11:12.217 --> 00:11:15.415
<v Josh Sparkes>Racing lease price.
Let's do some of these,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1103-1
00:11:15.415 --> 00:11:20.719
<v Josh Sparkes>but also the common space as well.
So I'm not sure if that is that these</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1103-2
00:11:20.719 --> 00:11:24.862
<v Josh Sparkes>problems I think so.
Kelly supposed to be picking up the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1103-3
00:11:24.862 --> 00:11:30.457
<v Josh Sparkes>different patients planning and probably
engaged with those signals as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1104-0
00:11:32.577 --> 00:11:36.322
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's a piece that we can start.
I should pull some of the the outputs of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1104-1
00:11:36.322 --> 00:11:39.477
<v Josh Sparkes>our sessions in terms of what we designed
for the organisation,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1104-2
00:11:39.477 --> 00:11:42.926
<v Josh Sparkes>how to overchang everyone's,
communicate really or really to not over</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1104-3
00:11:42.926 --> 00:11:46.721
<v Josh Sparkes>communicate too quickly as well because
we don't want to stand stare some of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1104-4
00:11:46.721 --> 00:11:50.417
<v Josh Sparkes>those stakeholders at the same time.
So it's the right time for the right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1105-0
00:11:51.057 --> 00:11:57.087
<v Josh Sparkes>And I think it will. I mean, yes,
there's a lot of operations</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1105-1
00:11:57.087 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Josh Sparkes>administrative piece like,
you know and information which is coming</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1105-2
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.617
<v Josh Sparkes>which has been requested from.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1106-0
00:12:07.137 --> 00:12:10.003
<v Josh Sparkes>OPS to us like and then all these
sessions so far.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1106-1
00:12:10.003 --> 00:12:12.476
<v Josh Sparkes>Like you know generally no change the
rate.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1106-2
00:12:12.476 --> 00:12:16.972
<v Josh Sparkes>So generally we'll pick up the rate and
change it address and all our cacheting</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1106-3
00:12:16.972 --> 00:12:20.905
<v Josh Sparkes>or can you make this payment.
So this as of now like this week so far</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1106-4
00:12:20.905 --> 00:12:23.097
<v Josh Sparkes>what you have heard is from them to us.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1107-0
00:12:23.457 --> 00:12:27.105
<v Josh Sparkes>But when you have the credit control and
the web chat on Monday,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1107-1
00:12:27.105 --> 00:12:30.921
<v Josh Sparkes>it's the other way around.
Because we are telling them that what is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1107-2
00:12:30.921 --> 00:12:34.961
<v Josh Sparkes>the web and this is what you have to
build. So it is equally important.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1107-3
00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:39.507
<v Josh Sparkes>So they have to understand the site we as
well over here that it's it's not just</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1107-4
00:12:39.507 --> 00:12:42.537
<v Josh Sparkes>one way that they don't use it.
And then though they.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1108-0
00:12:43.217 --> 00:12:45.720
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean that they can get away with the
benefit.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1108-1
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.213
<v Josh Sparkes>It's also that we will be using the same
services in the same way,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1108-2
00:12:49.213 --> 00:12:52.758
<v Josh Sparkes>so they should be equipped,
they should be understanding how we are</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1108-3
00:12:52.758 --> 00:12:56.877
<v Josh Sparkes>communicating as well. That's fine. OK,
yeah. Yep. I'll capture that and I'll,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1108-4
00:12:56.877 --> 00:13:00.684
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll put that up command one for yeah.
On Mondays. Yeah. Otherwise, yes,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1108-5
00:13:00.684 --> 00:13:01.257
<v Josh Sparkes>we will be.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1109-0
00:13:01.457 --> 00:13:05.343
<v Josh Sparkes>Frustrated at the beginning, as you said,
it's not gonna be smooth from day one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1109-1
00:13:05.343 --> 00:13:07.741
<v Josh Sparkes>I get it.
We will be frustrated for the first few</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1109-2
00:13:07.741 --> 00:13:10.044
<v Josh Sparkes>months,
but they will be way behind in the long</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1109-3
00:13:10.044 --> 00:13:13.018
<v Josh Sparkes>term because if they don't capture,
if they don't understand,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1109-4
00:13:13.018 --> 00:13:14.457
<v Josh Sparkes>especially if they have. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1110-0
00:13:15.497 --> 00:13:15.697
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1111-0
00:13:19.017 --> 00:13:23.137
<v Josh Sparkes>Just an advice. They're very,
very of change, so good luck.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1112-0
00:13:26.537 --> 00:13:26.657
<v Josh Sparkes>In uh.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1113-0
00:13:29.217 --> 00:13:32.088
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
change is something that not any like the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1113-1
00:13:32.088 --> 00:13:35.258
<v Josh Sparkes>world likes.
Everyone likes to continue working that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1113-2
00:13:35.258 --> 00:13:40.282
<v Josh Sparkes>the way that they've always been working.
So this is something that we'll consider,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1113-3
00:13:40.282 --> 00:13:43.153
<v Josh Sparkes>obviously lawyers,
partners V like VPS or VIPs.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1113-4
00:13:43.153 --> 00:13:46.263
<v Josh Sparkes>And from what I've been hearing in these
workshops,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1113-5
00:13:46.263 --> 00:13:48.177
<v Josh Sparkes>they have a certain mindset and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1114-0
00:13:48.777 --> 00:13:53.375
<v Josh Sparkes>This is something that we'll we'll need
to consider as part of our change plan.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1114-1
00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:56.248
<v Josh Sparkes>I say that it's it's,
it's not 100% to be blamed,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1114-2
00:13:56.248 --> 00:14:00.731
<v Josh Sparkes>but majority to be blamed to be honest.
But I think they they sit next to the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1114-3
00:14:00.731 --> 00:14:04.007
<v Josh Sparkes>partners, right.
So partners will just throw the pile at</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1114-4
00:14:04.007 --> 00:14:07.857
<v Josh Sparkes>them and say get it done now.
So they are under the same pressure.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1115-0
00:14:08.377 --> 00:14:12.521
<v Josh Sparkes>Exactly. Yeah. So culture, the culture.
Yeah. So yeah, it's that high it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1115-1
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:16.721
<v Josh Sparkes>It seems like there's that hierarchy.
Right. They can get away with, like,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1115-2
00:14:16.721 --> 00:14:21.313
<v Josh Sparkes>asking someone else to do things for them.
And that's why it's going to be a huge</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1115-3
00:14:21.313 --> 00:14:25.793
<v Josh Sparkes>shift for them to empower themselves to
do things via self-service and not just</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1115-4
00:14:25.793 --> 00:14:27.977
<v Josh Sparkes>pick up the phone and ask someone else.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1116-0
00:14:28.017 --> 00:14:31.257
<v Josh Sparkes>To do it for them. So.
So there there are certain divisions,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1116-1
00:14:31.257 --> 00:14:34.232
<v Josh Sparkes>partner heads.
You know where whatever ServiceNow is on</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1116-2
00:14:34.232 --> 00:14:38.163
<v Josh Sparkes>offer in terms of the status updates and
say 1E bill and what are the six</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1116-3
00:14:38.163 --> 00:14:42.093
<v Josh Sparkes>different statuses we're doing it
manually right now on an Excel tracker.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1116-4
00:14:42.093 --> 00:14:46.290
<v Josh Sparkes>Every day we pull the reports and we do
that change the statuses and also some</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1116-5
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.777
<v Josh Sparkes>people do like that kind of.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1117-0
00:14:47.977 --> 00:14:52.428
<v Josh Sparkes>Supporting so you will have some buyers,
but I think it's an overall general</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1117-1
00:14:52.428 --> 00:14:57.052
<v Josh Sparkes>practise which they have to enforce and
so all that knows you have you know not</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1117-2
00:14:57.052 --> 00:14:59.769
<v Josh Sparkes>we're not tiring everyone with the same
brush.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1117-3
00:14:59.769 --> 00:15:04.220
<v Josh Sparkes>But would you have partners that can
champion the behaviour of self we do we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1117-4
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.937
<v Josh Sparkes>do pick on those.
So we do pilot whatever new.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1118-0
00:15:07.777 --> 00:15:11.041
<v Josh Sparkes>What are the new things we try to
experiment and roll out?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1118-1
00:15:11.041 --> 00:15:15.410
<v Josh Sparkes>We pick up those divisions of those group
of partners and and what really like</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1118-2
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:19.946
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a proper two way discussion and
they they do appreciate you know whatever</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1118-3
00:15:19.946 --> 00:15:22.435
<v Josh Sparkes>we do.
So you mean that Sandeep sorry do you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1118-4
00:15:22.435 --> 00:15:24.537
<v Josh Sparkes>mean that there's a few like partners?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1119-0
00:15:25.177 --> 00:15:29.354
<v Josh Sparkes>In the business who are like,
open to change and they normally will get</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1119-1
00:15:29.354 --> 00:15:32.545
<v Josh Sparkes>on board and open.
To change digitalization, you know,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1119-2
00:15:32.545 --> 00:15:36.259
<v Josh Sparkes>automation and all those. So yeah,
that there are few. OK yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1119-3
00:15:36.259 --> 00:15:40.958
<v Josh Sparkes>Because then that can help form one of
the interventions that you can do like so</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1119-4
00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.497
<v Josh Sparkes>see, I'll be honest with you.
So so you have those partners.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1120-0
00:15:44.577 --> 00:15:47.607
<v Josh Sparkes>Who want that change to happen now?
They are partners.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1120-1
00:15:47.607 --> 00:15:51.958
<v Josh Sparkes>They don't care how the change happens.
It's our responsibilities as well as a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1120-2
00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.208
<v Josh Sparkes>business service champion.
So they would give a thumbs up.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1120-3
00:15:55.208 --> 00:15:58.237
<v Josh Sparkes>My job is to roll it out in between.
You have the OPS,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1120-4
00:15:58.237 --> 00:16:01.377
<v Josh Sparkes>so OPS have to be on the same page as me
as well, right?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1121-0
00:16:02.177 --> 00:16:05.550
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's not the case.
And and in most of the scenarios,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1121-1
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:09.515
<v Josh Sparkes>meaning they're fighting against the
change and not so it's. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1121-2
00:16:09.515 --> 00:16:10.817
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a mix of problem.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1122-0
00:16:13.657 --> 00:16:16.552
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, causing the issue. Both policy.
Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1122-1
00:16:16.552 --> 00:16:20.566
<v Josh Sparkes>Push it down with them and then the
officer trying to, yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1122-2
00:16:20.566 --> 00:16:24.909
<v Josh Sparkes>build their duties as well.
And then we just take that as a whole</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1122-3
00:16:24.909 --> 00:16:29.910
<v Josh Sparkes>whole and and and and you I think
yesterday we were saying and tomorrow you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1122-4
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.937
<v Josh Sparkes>will know more so billing is only done in
UK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1123-0
00:16:33.337 --> 00:16:39.804
<v Josh Sparkes>By ask it's kind of like decentralised in
Australia, so the BES, the operations,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1123-1
00:16:39.804 --> 00:16:44.833
<v Josh Sparkes>they do their own billing.
So because the BES, the operations,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1123-2
00:16:44.833 --> 00:16:49.544
<v Josh Sparkes>they have a better understanding of
billing as they do it,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1123-3
00:16:49.544 --> 00:16:52.817
<v Josh Sparkes>they can join the dots easily about Rama.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1124-0
00:16:53.097 --> 00:16:57.908
<v Josh Sparkes>E billing. You know everything else.
So they might be more receptive and they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1124-1
00:16:57.908 --> 00:17:01.546
<v Josh Sparkes>might kind of like see the benefits
straight away of this,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1124-2
00:17:01.546 --> 00:17:04.383
<v Josh Sparkes>whereas there's a slightly different
process.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1124-3
00:17:04.383 --> 00:17:08.577
<v Josh Sparkes>What we do in the UK and and the
pushbacks are more on the UK side.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1125-0
00:17:12.177 --> 00:17:14.842
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm conscious of time.
I know that we have to finish in the next</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1125-1
00:17:14.842 --> 00:17:16.892
<v Josh Sparkes>5 minutes.
Can I just say something very quickly?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1125-2
00:17:16.892 --> 00:17:20.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Just off the back of the portal and stuff?
I know this obviously is like the change</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1125-3
00:17:20.337 --> 00:17:22.182
<v Josh Sparkes>piece is huge,
but I also do think there's a</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1125-4
00:17:22.182 --> 00:17:25.462
<v Josh Sparkes>responsibility for the teams on day one,
making sure that someone's emailing in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1125-5
00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:28.537
<v Josh Sparkes>because of the emails still going to be a
thing. We're not turning it off.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1126-0
00:17:28.617 --> 00:17:30.916
<v Josh Sparkes>Off, if we could leave,
I don't think we can.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1126-1
00:17:30.916 --> 00:17:34.963
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's a responsibility for the teams
to be making sure someone's emailed in</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1126-2
00:17:34.963 --> 00:17:38.911
<v Josh Sparkes>instead of using the portal that we're
pushing back straight away because this</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1126-3
00:17:38.911 --> 00:17:42.559
<v Josh Sparkes>is a problem we had with Atlas,
we didn't do it and it hardly gets used.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1126-4
00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:45.857
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's far too late to do it now,
like 4-4 years down the line.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1127-0
00:17:47.017 --> 00:17:48.457
<v Josh Sparkes>But again, we'll pick that up and.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1128-0
00:17:51.017 --> 00:17:53.217
<v Josh Sparkes>100% yeah, even nearly.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1134-0
00:18:14.897 --> 00:18:17.911
<v Mark Sedge>We've got sound team.
Don't know if someone speaking them,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1133-0
00:18:16.857 --> 00:18:17.097
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1134-1
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:19.137
<v Mark Sedge>but we couldn't hear it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1135-0
00:18:20.017 --> 00:18:23.370
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
If they see that their query is responded</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1135-1
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:28.748
<v Josh Sparkes>to faster on the ServiceNow platform and
they'll start to see the benefit of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1135-2
00:18:28.748 --> 00:18:33.916
<v Josh Sparkes>moving towards ServiceNow. Yeah, exactly.
But you're always good. I mean,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1135-3
00:18:33.916 --> 00:18:38.177
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm very much for modelling behaviour of
and I'm not saying.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1136-0
00:18:38.297 --> 00:18:42.285
<v Josh Sparkes>We're gonna get 90% accuracy,
but I think it's the attitude it's,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1136-1
00:18:42.285 --> 00:18:45.972
<v Josh Sparkes>it's the willingness.
And then we we we get thrown under the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1136-2
00:18:45.972 --> 00:18:48.933
<v Josh Sparkes>bus often.
Maybe you need to capture your junior</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1136-3
00:18:48.933 --> 00:18:51.894
<v Josh Sparkes>associate.
Then junior lawyers now to model good</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1136-4
00:18:51.894 --> 00:18:55.217
<v Josh Sparkes>behaviour so that they you don't mean it
comes I mean.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1137-0
00:18:56.457 --> 00:19:00.655
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it needs to be from the top, yes,
like partners,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1137-1
00:19:00.655 --> 00:19:05.662
<v Josh Sparkes>partners are the ones who are are
creating a lot of that additional</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1137-2
00:19:05.662 --> 00:19:09.123
<v Josh Sparkes>workload.
So it's about getting a few of those</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1137-3
00:19:09.123 --> 00:19:10.817
<v Josh Sparkes>champions on board 1st.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1138-0
00:19:11.737 --> 00:19:16.694
<v Josh Sparkes>And then them speaking to their peers to
show the benefit of doing things through</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1138-1
00:19:16.694 --> 00:19:19.596
<v Josh Sparkes>service dial versus.
I agree that billing time,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1138-2
00:19:19.596 --> 00:19:23.828
<v Josh Sparkes>you know they're under pressure for
targets, you know, 80 percent 85.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1138-3
00:19:23.828 --> 00:19:26.971
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
I understand that time is very important,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1138-4
00:19:26.971 --> 00:19:30.417
<v Josh Sparkes>but I'll leave it now is that it does the
heavy lifting.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1139-0
00:19:30.657 --> 00:19:34.955
<v Josh Sparkes>You can't see the trust that it takes
away that from them. So yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1139-1
00:19:34.955 --> 00:19:40.138
<v Josh Sparkes>long term it will cut down a lot of their
time of chasing and all. Yeah, exactly.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1139-2
00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:42.919
<v Josh Sparkes>Because you can see the status of
yourself.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1139-3
00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:45.257
<v Josh Sparkes>You can speak to the people yourself.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1140-0
00:19:46.057 --> 00:19:49.563
<v Josh Sparkes>Do hand hold a lot of such processes?
As I said before and partners see the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1140-1
00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:53.162
<v Josh Sparkes>benefit that there's one person doing
that, but then when it's on the system,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1140-2
00:19:53.162 --> 00:19:55.376
<v Josh Sparkes>everybody can have that visibility,
it's gonna,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1140-3
00:19:55.376 --> 00:19:57.590
<v Josh Sparkes>it's gonna be benefit for them. But like,
yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1140-4
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.897
<v Josh Sparkes>it's it's just a change mindset if
they're. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1141-0
00:20:00.377 --> 00:20:04.411
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, sure. Well,
as we'll get closer to when we're sending</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1141-1
00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:07.638
<v Josh Sparkes>notifications,
like tickets closed or whatever,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1141-2
00:20:07.638 --> 00:20:11.470
<v Josh Sparkes>could we change?
Is there options to change the word and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1141-3
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.899

00:20:14.899 --> 00:20:17.857
<v Josh Sparkes>You have to use the portal,
blah blah blah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1143-0
00:20:22.297 --> 00:20:25.766
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah. So, you know,
one closer time sets up once up. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1143-1
00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:28.809
<v Josh Sparkes>It's almost like we're going all this
time. Right there.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1143-2
00:20:28.809 --> 00:20:32.865
<v Josh Sparkes>Almost might start to communicate.
We'll be closing tickets moving forward.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1143-3
00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:36.655
<v Josh Sparkes>You now need to start using service now
or whichever the name of them.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1143-4
00:20:36.655 --> 00:20:39.377
<v Josh Sparkes>And this would be that, you know,
this would be a.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1144-0
00:20:40.217 --> 00:20:45.643
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can't get the better plug around.
I'll get the key. Actually use it. No, no,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1144-1
00:20:45.643 --> 00:20:49.519
<v Josh Sparkes>that's good. As part of, you know,
general realise. Anyway,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1144-2
00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:53.976
<v Josh Sparkes>you would be system ready. Yeah,
and and you go through integration.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1144-3
00:20:53.976 --> 00:20:57.658
<v Josh Sparkes>Where did you go through, you know,
application content.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1144-4
00:20:57.658 --> 00:20:59.337
<v Josh Sparkes>But the key 1A data ready.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1145-0
00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:02.303
<v Josh Sparkes>You know things are but a key.
One is people ready?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1145-1
00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:05.744
<v Josh Sparkes>Are your people ready to go and that that
will be signed off?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1145-2
00:21:05.744 --> 00:21:09.684
<v Josh Sparkes>That's not suddenly it's here.
OK is there is that people readiness as</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1145-3
00:21:09.684 --> 00:21:14.124
<v Josh Sparkes>well as you would do the testing that
gets signed off and that people readiness</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1145-4
00:21:14.124 --> 00:21:18.231
<v Josh Sparkes>will come into the change plan as well
because we'll need to do readiness</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1145-5
00:21:18.231 --> 00:21:18.897
<v Josh Sparkes>assessments.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1146-0
00:21:19.297 --> 00:21:19.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Umm.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1147-0
00:21:19.777 --> 00:21:24.408
<v Josh Sparkes>With the business to understand if they
feel they've had enough training,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1147-1
00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:28.039
<v Josh Sparkes>are they ready?
Do they see the benefit of doing this and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1147-2
00:21:28.039 --> 00:21:31.731
<v Josh Sparkes>and if there are,
if there's any resistance or people feel</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1147-3
00:21:31.731 --> 00:21:35.799
<v Josh Sparkes>that they're not ready yet,
then we would address that before we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1147-4
00:21:35.799 --> 00:21:38.741
<v Josh Sparkes>reach,
go live and hand holding and and I know</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1147-5
00:21:38.741 --> 00:21:39.617
<v Josh Sparkes>I'd introduce.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1148-0
00:21:39.777 --> 00:21:40.817
<v Josh Sparkes>And I went back, it was to.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1149-0
00:21:43.257 --> 00:21:45.894
<v Josh Sparkes>And I've got a training session with the
PS.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1149-1
00:21:45.894 --> 00:21:50.230
<v Josh Sparkes>But what I've done as well was we'd
organise for a pilot group that would</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1149-2
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:54.566
<v Josh Sparkes>actually use in portal for this,
so I don't know whether that's something</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1149-3
00:21:54.566 --> 00:21:59.312
<v Josh Sparkes>you consider to get them one more site to
have tests to pilot. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1149-4
00:21:59.312 --> 00:22:02.417
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not a system. Well,
they won't be doing actual.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1150-0
00:22:03.817 --> 00:22:08.672
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, something scenario. Yeah, yes.
So so the same as but standing.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1150-1
00:22:08.672 --> 00:22:14.231
<v Josh Sparkes>So there is some people that's. Yeah.
Advocates. Yeah. That's good. Champions.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1150-2

<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. You're good.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1151-0

<v Josh Sparkes>All right.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1152-0
00:22:19.977 --> 00:22:22.709
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, no worries.
We've got a pretty hard start,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1152-1
00:22:22.709 --> 00:22:26.612
<v Josh Sparkes>but we're OK. So mainly Joe,
just going to ask Leanne to push it back</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1152-2
00:22:26.612 --> 00:22:31.184
<v Josh Sparkes>a wee bit, maybe 10 minutes or something,
one meeting. So don't worry. All right,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1152-3
00:22:31.184 --> 00:22:33.916
<v Josh Sparkes>thank you.
Mainly informative couple of calls to</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1152-4
00:22:33.916 --> 00:22:36.704
<v Josh Sparkes>action.
Just to consider over the next few weeks,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1152-5
00:22:36.704 --> 00:22:38.377
<v Josh Sparkes>really dashboards and reports.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1153-0
00:22:38.697 --> 00:22:41.901
<v Josh Sparkes>These are some that we we like to suggest
for your area,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1153-1
00:22:41.901 --> 00:22:46.342
<v Josh Sparkes>but you know things we've come up with
today can inform requirements for these</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1153-2
00:22:46.342 --> 00:22:50.783
<v Josh Sparkes>kind of show up anything top of mind or
you can have a think over the next few</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1153-3
00:22:50.783 --> 00:22:53.537
<v Josh Sparkes>weeks what you would like dashboard
report wise?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1154-0
00:22:54.417 --> 00:22:57.394
<v Josh Sparkes>At least they sort of tend to be your
daily activities.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1154-1
00:22:57.394 --> 00:23:01.805
<v Josh Sparkes>You can get a track of as things you know
are breaching their Slas or can include.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1154-2
00:23:01.805 --> 00:23:05.420
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a whole variety of you don't want
to cloud your dashboards,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1154-3
00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.928
<v Josh Sparkes>but you know three months time you don't
want to be on the radar,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1154-4
00:23:08.928 --> 00:23:10.097
<v Josh Sparkes>but everything's that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1155-0
00:23:10.577 --> 00:23:15.050
<v Josh Sparkes>You know outside, you know, as you said,
with those things that might be urgent or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1155-1
00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.960
<v Josh Sparkes>complex that you could track.
But in answer in stone,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1155-2
00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:22.217
<v Josh Sparkes>but there might be a set that you find
useful today or there might be a series</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1155-3
00:23:22.217 --> 00:23:26.690
<v Josh Sparkes>of questions that you think that you get
asked within your team that actually even</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1155-4
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.977
<v Josh Sparkes>internal questions that could be
addressed on the dashboard.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1156-0
00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:35.782
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, no worries.
So we could share it and then you can</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1156-1
00:23:35.782 --> 00:23:39.917
<v Josh Sparkes>have a look and have a think about what
you want. Yeah, I'll send it all. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1156-2
00:23:39.917 --> 00:23:42.398
<v Josh Sparkes>absolutely.
And that will inform what we write,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1156-3
00:23:42.398 --> 00:23:45.034
<v Josh Sparkes>the user stories that you'll have sight
of anyway.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1156-4
00:23:45.034 --> 00:23:48.497
<v Josh Sparkes>So go through with you as well and
knowledge super quick touch on.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1157-0
00:23:49.017 --> 00:23:53.643
<v Josh Sparkes>That I want to play that thing just have
again having a think about what knowledge</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1157-1
00:23:53.643 --> 00:23:58.101
<v Josh Sparkes>thing might be useful for for your your
customers employee side to help them as</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1157-2
00:23:58.101 --> 00:24:02.504
<v Josh Sparkes>we discussed and they'll also be the you
know the existing knowledge moved and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1157-3
00:24:02.504 --> 00:24:05.960
<v Josh Sparkes>updated for the system.
So again something to think about the</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1157-4
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.297
<v Josh Sparkes>next few days and weeks.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1158-0
00:24:07.977 --> 00:24:12.377
<v Josh Sparkes>And where are we? Just so you can see,
this is the some of the user storage</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1158-1
00:24:12.377 --> 00:24:16.720
<v Josh Sparkes>format we'll be doing and part of the
next phase of the project will be us</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1158-2
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.788
<v Josh Sparkes>writing that.
And I think I think there's a plan for</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1158-3
00:24:19.788 --> 00:24:23.783
<v Josh Sparkes>the the aerial leads, Julie,
right to review the user stories. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1158-4
00:24:23.783 --> 00:24:25.057
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm stepping up. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1159-0
00:24:26.457 --> 00:24:30.211
<v Josh Sparkes>Stories that you told today in the
scenarios and what you'd like to do.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1159-1
00:24:30.211 --> 00:24:34.486
<v Josh Sparkes>I have the plan. I'll go through with you.
I have to go through with all the SMEs</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1159-2
00:24:34.486 --> 00:24:37.197
<v Josh Sparkes>for all the team.
So we just discussed before here.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1159-3
00:24:37.197 --> 00:24:40.168
<v Josh Sparkes>So you'll see what we're doing.
Functional requirements,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1159-4
00:24:40.168 --> 00:24:42.097
<v Josh Sparkes>which you'll have, you know, sign on.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1160-0
00:24:42.737 --> 00:24:46.308
<v Josh Sparkes>So you'll see what we're doing and what
we're planning to build. Yeah,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1160-1
00:24:46.308 --> 00:24:49.879
<v Josh Sparkes>what decisions we plan to defend today.
Yeah. Next thing's first then.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1160-2
00:24:49.879 --> 00:24:52.142
<v Josh Sparkes>So we're going to publish all of this
stuff,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1160-3
00:24:52.142 --> 00:24:55.964
<v Josh Sparkes>including the the deck and the notes and
the actions and all the outputs of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1160-4
00:24:55.964 --> 00:24:58.177
<v Josh Sparkes>compensation over the next couple of
weeks.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1161-0
00:24:58.617 --> 00:25:02.963
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got a conversation around Slas in a
couple of weeks in the calendar as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1161-1
00:25:02.963 --> 00:25:06.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Not sure from the invite.
Let me know if you if you want to be on</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1161-2
00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.724
<v Josh Sparkes>there,
get in touch afterwards conversation</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1161-3
00:25:08.724 --> 00:25:12.494
<v Josh Sparkes>around integrations, you know,
especially permanent with three East and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1161-4
00:25:12.494 --> 00:25:15.793
<v Josh Sparkes>what's going on there.
So that that's in the calendar as well.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1161-5
00:25:15.793 --> 00:25:18.097
<v Josh Sparkes>Then we'll be doing the the drafting
which.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1162-0
00:25:18.177 --> 00:25:21.978
<v Josh Sparkes>Which you mentioned there,
and if there's any follow up sessions</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1162-1
00:25:21.978 --> 00:25:26.189
<v Josh Sparkes>then there's kind of space for that.
But I think design wise we covered</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1162-2
00:25:26.189 --> 00:25:28.177
<v Josh Sparkes>everything. So I think we're good.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1163-0
00:25:29.937 --> 00:25:32.739
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
And then high highest level maybe dates</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1163-1
00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:37.489
<v Josh Sparkes>that you might be most interested in.
So those earlier ones are made us doing</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1163-2
00:25:37.489 --> 00:25:42.301
<v Josh Sparkes>the technical bit and the writing bit.
But then there's testing phase training</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1163-3
00:25:42.301 --> 00:25:45.224
<v Josh Sparkes>phase,
go live date for your ongoing service or</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1163-4
00:25:45.224 --> 00:25:47.417
<v Josh Sparkes>they might be of interest date wise.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1164-0
00:25:48.217 --> 00:25:54.734
<v Josh Sparkes>Just highlighted them and that's it. Oh,
no, sorry, joy. We've covered some of it.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1164-1
00:25:54.734 --> 00:25:58.424
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
we've covered a lot of change management</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1164-2
00:25:58.424 --> 00:26:04.469
<v Josh Sparkes>in that this question just earlier.
Is there anything else that you think we</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1164-3
00:26:04.469 --> 00:26:07.217
<v Josh Sparkes>need to consider for the Rama team?</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1165-0
00:26:07.297 --> 00:26:11.817
<v Josh Sparkes>Other than the behaviour of of the PES
and and how they raise requests.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1166-0
00:26:19.377 --> 00:26:22.305
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the ad hoc request, right?
The ad hoc request.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1166-1
00:26:22.305 --> 00:26:26.584
<v Josh Sparkes>They're not using the right channels.
Sometimes they should be using 3E and</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1166-2
00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:30.018
<v Josh Sparkes>then with ServiceNow,
some of their requests will go through</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1166-3
00:26:30.018 --> 00:26:32.777
<v Josh Sparkes>service now.
So it's just that training and that</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1166-4
00:26:32.777 --> 00:26:34.297
<v Josh Sparkes>guidance to make sure that.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1167-0
00:26:35.497 --> 00:26:40.329
<v Josh Sparkes>Before they raise a request,
they've done certain cheques that they</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1167-1
00:26:40.329 --> 00:26:45.232
<v Josh Sparkes>need to do and that sometimes,
if it's something that is within your</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1167-2
00:26:45.232 --> 00:26:50.277
<v Josh Sparkes>team's remit that they know that they can
raise that food service now.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1167-3
00:26:50.277 --> 00:26:53.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Otherwise they need to do it themselves
in 3E.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1168-0
00:26:54.857 --> 00:27:00.344
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's is that the main OK,
that is the main until the project kicks</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1168-1
00:27:00.344 --> 00:27:05.907
<v Josh Sparkes>off because the whole point of the
project is to review end to end. Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1168-2
00:27:05.907 --> 00:27:10.417
<v Josh Sparkes>And I think there might be and that there
will be for sure.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1169-0
00:27:11.017 --> 00:27:14.829
<v Josh Sparkes>Be more bigger changes than what you have
noted down, I guess,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1169-1
00:27:14.829 --> 00:27:19.064
<v Josh Sparkes>like how the discounts et cetera is
maintained communication and all.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1169-2
00:27:19.064 --> 00:27:23.722
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think now I think we are fine.
I can't see the one project timelines is</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1169-3
00:27:23.722 --> 00:27:27.352
<v Josh Sparkes>where it's not even kicked off.
So when and how it happens,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1169-4
00:27:27.352 --> 00:27:30.377
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll let you know if there is anything
any major.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1170-0
00:27:30.537 --> 00:27:33.543
<v Josh Sparkes>Changes which we have to factor.
Yes please.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1170-1
00:27:33.543 --> 00:27:38.886
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the way we're approaching like
our change impacts report which is where</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1170-2
00:27:38.886 --> 00:27:44.096
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm going to be capturing all these
impacts is that it will be accurate as of</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1170-3
00:27:44.096 --> 00:27:44.697
<v Josh Sparkes>the time.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1171-0
00:27:45.537 --> 00:27:49.054
<v Josh Sparkes>That we've captured it.
So we'll send you a draught and then you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1171-1
00:27:49.054 --> 00:27:52.949
<v Josh Sparkes>can review and then it can be signed off.
But obviously as we go along,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1171-2
00:27:52.949 --> 00:27:56.249
<v Josh Sparkes>certain decisions will be made,
things from the parking lot,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1171-3
00:27:56.249 --> 00:28:00.631
<v Josh Sparkes>there'll be more discussions and then we
can continue to create further versions</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1171-4
00:28:00.631 --> 00:28:01.497
<v Josh Sparkes>of the document.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1172-0
00:28:01.857 --> 00:28:01.977
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1173-0
00:28:03.777 --> 00:28:08.093
<v Josh Sparkes>I think United State, my quick,
maybe a quick win between now and anyway</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1173-1
00:28:08.093 --> 00:28:11.759
<v Josh Sparkes>if that's as you said,
you get the queries that and model you</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1173-2
00:28:11.759 --> 00:28:16.607
<v Josh Sparkes>know the behaviour change that can happen
already is that I won't see what are my</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1173-3
00:28:16.607 --> 00:28:21.042
<v Josh Sparkes>rates and already you could say if the
rate card is the goes the Internet.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1173-4
00:28:21.042 --> 00:28:22.697
<v Josh Sparkes>So maybe that's a quick one.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1174-0
00:28:23.097 --> 00:28:27.570
<v Josh Sparkes>Day that we can already start to see some
change that can happen even prior to go</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1174-1
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:29.697
<v Josh Sparkes>live.
So that's A and it's gonna be an</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1174-2
00:28:29.697 --> 00:28:33.406
<v Josh Sparkes>identical discussion tomorrow as well.
Yeah, because it's the same,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1174-3
00:28:33.406 --> 00:28:36.570
<v Josh Sparkes>almost the same stakeholder and the same
kind of queries,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1174-4
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:39.897
<v Josh Sparkes>not drama but like billing queries we
will have tomorrow so.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1175-0
00:28:40.537 --> 00:28:43.833
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah,
we've got half a day or 1:00 since. Well,</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1175-1
00:28:43.833 --> 00:28:47.008
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
adding half a day should be initially OK.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1175-2
00:28:47.008 --> 00:28:51.281
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah. OK. And finally,
thank you very, very much for your time.</v>

<v Josh Sparkes>He's tired, I know.</v>

4521fdea-d3fa-497d-aed2-4d826bbfc32f/1177-0
00:29:00.097 --> 00:29:03.121
