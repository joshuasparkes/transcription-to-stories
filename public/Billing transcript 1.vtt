
START OF BILLING CONVERSATION PART 1:


99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/122-2
00:15:39.715 --> 00:15:41.844
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>better,
we can control a bit more of the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/122-3
00:15:41.844 --> 00:15:45.686
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>information that comes in so that we can
assign it to that kind of label.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/122-4
00:15:45.686 --> 00:15:49.736
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That could be the feed into the scheme
metrics that we can help you know work</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/122-5
00:15:49.736 --> 00:15:52.956
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>through that. Yeah.
So I spoke to Mel yesterday as well about</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/122-6
00:15:52.956 --> 00:15:53.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>this.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/123-0
00:15:54.575 --> 00:15:57.689
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I understand better now in terms of why
and what we need.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/123-1
00:15:57.689 --> 00:16:00.910
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I think we have a catch up tonight.
I mean this evening,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/123-2
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:02.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so kind of try and draught 1 here.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/124-0
00:16:04.895 --> 00:16:07.951
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And if you know if you want to kind of
play back some of that and you need some</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/124-1
00:16:07.951 --> 00:16:10.471
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>support from us in terms,
what does that look like in ServiceNow,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/124-2
00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:13.297
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then then we're happy to do that as well.
One thing I'll say is you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/124-3
00:16:13.297 --> 00:16:16.390
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as we go through some of these services
and you think actually it's difficult to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/124-4
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.873
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>kind of separate out the cases or the
requests that come in now,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/124-5
00:16:18.873 --> 00:16:21.355
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we might start to think about how do we
categorise some of this,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/124-6
00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:24.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>how do we make this information a little
bit more easy for us to understand.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/125-0
00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:27.189
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Understand some of the complexities and
then we can start to think, OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/125-1
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:29.846
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>actually for the first release,
could we start to put some of those</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/125-2
00:16:29.846 --> 00:16:32.152
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>skills matrix in.
So it's something we can we can start to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/125-3
00:16:32.152 --> 00:16:32.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>think for as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/126-0
00:16:36.135 --> 00:16:38.834
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Just kind of playback.
So this was kind of the view from the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/126-1
00:16:38.834 --> 00:16:41.489
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>previous sessions,
just capturing some of those kind of key</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/126-2
00:16:41.489 --> 00:16:44.985
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>pain points in here and you know these
kind of really helps to inform was that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/126-3
00:16:44.985 --> 00:16:48.480
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we're designing how are we consolidating
those services which I'll let Deborah</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/126-4
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.754
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>kind of talk through in a moment.
But it's just kind of make sure that as</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/126-5
00:16:51.754 --> 00:16:54.453
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we go through this,
we're trying to address as much of these</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/126-6
00:16:54.453 --> 00:16:54.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as we can.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/127-0
00:16:55.255 --> 00:16:57.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I won't go forward and I'm sure you you
can't familiar with some of these the way.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/128-0
00:17:02.495 --> 00:17:05.525
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That brush I'll hand over to you in terms
of the approach.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/128-1
00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:08.863
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we'll go through a lot of your
processes that we've received.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/128-2
00:17:08.863 --> 00:17:12.355
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think there were like 40,
maybe 39 to 40 processes across complex</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/128-3
00:17:12.355 --> 00:17:14.665
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing billing.
There's some whip in there.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/128-4
00:17:14.665 --> 00:17:18.465
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Certainly I don't want you to feel that
it's sort of death by row by row.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/128-5
00:17:18.465 --> 00:17:21.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We won't look at it that we'll bring it
up a level.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/129-0
00:17:21.455 --> 00:17:25.498
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But really, as you sort of said,
was that trigger points of how you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/129-1
00:17:25.498 --> 00:17:28.529
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>receive it,
how what information you want upfront.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/129-2
00:17:28.529 --> 00:17:32.987
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we'll get into those discussions that
would lead into better, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/129-3
00:17:32.987 --> 00:17:37.089
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>administration of these queries when they
come in. What's your slas?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/129-4
00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:40.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What's the assumed pre approval,
what needs to be in place?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/130-0
00:17:41.095 --> 00:17:44.000
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know,
maybe there's some things upstream that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/130-1
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.764
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we could capture that would make it a lot
easier for yourself that if only we had</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/130-2
00:17:48.764 --> 00:17:53.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>this go back and query and I'll so all
these things that we could potentially</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/130-3
00:17:53.295 --> 00:17:57.303
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>capture upfront to make the
administration of your task a lot easier</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/130-4
00:17:57.303 --> 00:17:59.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>such that it doesn't take longer to
complete.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/131-0
00:18:01.015 --> 00:18:04.659
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The task admin that it does to actually
do the work itself,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/131-1
00:18:04.659 --> 00:18:07.330
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we'll go through all of that,
you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/131-2
00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:12.067
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and the sort of the the data that you
might want upfront to the data that you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/131-3
00:18:12.067 --> 00:18:17.046
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>have to complete and to ongoing processes.
So that at the end of these workshops,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/131-4
00:18:17.046 --> 00:18:19.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we could have a whole view of end to end.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/132-0
00:18:20.615 --> 00:18:25.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And aid that seamless workflow across all
finance features,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/132-1
00:18:25.415 --> 00:18:31.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and that's where we hope to land today.
So probably taken 40 about 40 processes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/132-2
00:18:31.815 --> 00:18:38.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and sort of talked to it as a service
level rather than the minutiae of each of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/132-3
00:18:38.215 --> 00:18:39.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the tasks.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/133-0
00:18:40.015 --> 00:18:40.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/134-0
00:18:42.735 --> 00:18:45.832
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And the again,
this is sometimes if we go back to this</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/134-1
00:18:45.832 --> 00:18:48.817
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>sort of slide,
I think that's when we skip that one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/134-2
00:18:48.817 --> 00:18:52.308
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's got matter on it,
but it really is sort of breaking down</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/134-3
00:18:52.308 --> 00:18:54.898
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that service from these findings as you
said,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/134-4
00:18:54.898 --> 00:18:57.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there were lots of roads to bring it up
to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/135-0
00:18:59.535 --> 00:19:02.391
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know,
talking at it at that high level service</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/135-1
00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:06.871
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>level and each of those processes can
just be a scenario of a similar thing and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/135-2
00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:11.127
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the logic within ServiceNow would guide
you through that task a lot easier.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/135-3
00:19:11.127 --> 00:19:14.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But it's one of the same,
just a different scenario.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/136-0
00:19:15.295 --> 00:19:15.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/137-0
00:19:18.095 --> 00:19:22.211
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's probably where we can start if
you're if that's OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/137-1
00:19:22.211 --> 00:19:27.862
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think it's been very useful throughout
all the work sessions this week to sort</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/137-2
00:19:27.862 --> 00:19:32.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of maybe start with yourself and give us
a heads up of an overview of.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/138-0
00:19:33.135 --> 00:19:36.880
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Billing of what we do and then that would
just lead into,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/138-1
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.721
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I know that's probably a science in
itself,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/138-2
00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:44.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but they understand it is you know taking
all that information from.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/139-0
00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:48.559
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The partners and the billing and rolling
it up,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/139-1
00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:53.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and I'd probably be there's a bit of whip
and credit control maybe prior prior to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/139-2
00:19:53.655 --> 00:19:58.566
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what you do. I'm making assumptions,
correct me if I'm wrong and then creating</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/139-3
00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:01.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that bill for all the rates on the matter
give me.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/140-0
00:20:02.895 --> 00:20:06.244
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then rolling it up.
But maybe you can just give me a quick</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/140-1
00:20:06.244 --> 00:20:09.857
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>intro as well to the end.
You know the overall end to end processes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/140-2
00:20:09.857 --> 00:20:13.790
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>within billing, which I think is UK,
correct me if I'm wrong from all the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/140-3
00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.447
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>people I was going to say.
So it's auk thing, UK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/140-4
00:20:16.447 --> 00:20:20.167
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but then we cover a couple of other
European countries as well. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/140-5
00:20:20.167 --> 00:20:21.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and we'll talk through like.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/141-0
00:20:21.695 --> 00:20:26.085
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There are some transitions planned as
well in terms of a a region picking up</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/141-1
00:20:26.085 --> 00:20:30.531
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the billing and you know some some of the
bees doing some other billing in in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/141-2
00:20:30.531 --> 00:20:33.723
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>London as well.
So we'll cover that in in the meantime.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/141-3
00:20:33.723 --> 00:20:36.516
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But it's purely UK like the team is based
in UK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/141-4
00:20:36.516 --> 00:20:40.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but even for those locations they rolled
up to the UK. Yeah, yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/143-0
00:20:40.775 --> 00:20:44.840
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And in Australia,
which is basically the chunk of the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/143-1
00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.152
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>volumes, it's the PE,
the operations group,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/143-2
00:20:48.152 --> 00:20:51.992
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they manage the billing as well,
that's that rule.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/143-3
00:20:51.992 --> 00:20:58.089
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The billing rule is a part and part and
parcel of the rules and responsibilities</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/143-4
00:20:58.089 --> 00:20:59.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of of the PE over there.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/144-0
00:21:00.575 --> 00:21:04.805
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Whereas you know the responsibilities of
the be in the UK is different,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/144-1
00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:09.564
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so they they don't historically it's been
with us also you heard it on the three</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/144-2
00:21:09.564 --> 00:21:14.205
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and I mentioned about billing support.
So that is that one part of the process</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/144-3
00:21:14.205 --> 00:21:18.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>which the cashiers or or or the finance
ask finance team does pick up.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/145-0
00:21:19.055 --> 00:21:23.216
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Over there, but that process sits with,
you know, Gil's team over here.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/145-1
00:21:23.216 --> 00:21:27.262
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So just just a couple of nuances we have.
Yeah, certainly. And again,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/145-2
00:21:27.262 --> 00:21:32.001
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>probably as part of these conversations,
it's sort of a challenge back to this is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/145-3
00:21:32.001 --> 00:21:35.237
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what we do today.
But is that right for moving forward?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/145-4
00:21:35.237 --> 00:21:38.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I suppose to come to mind is that
question is that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/146-0
00:21:38.495 --> 00:21:41.325
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The model if you're moving to a
globalised,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/146-1
00:21:41.325 --> 00:21:46.211
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>will it challenge that actually the
utopia would be to push it back to peas</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/146-2
00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:50.133
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>in the UK as well. I mean,
is that on the horizon or is that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/146-3
00:21:50.133 --> 00:21:53.734
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>something that it will remain the billing?
As you said,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/146-4
00:21:53.734 --> 00:21:55.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there's a lot of complex billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/147-0
00:21:56.735 --> 00:21:59.262
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That is, yeah, I mean,
we'll we'll cover it in, in,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/147-1
00:21:59.262 --> 00:22:02.226
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>in the due course.
But I think we tried it and I think right</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/147-2
00:22:02.226 --> 00:22:05.628
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>now at least in the near future,
it sits with us at the minute. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/147-3
00:22:05.628 --> 00:22:07.571
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Again,
a region is there which has been</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/147-4
00:22:07.571 --> 00:22:11.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>discussed, to move to the local,
you know offices which which we'll cover.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/148-0
00:22:11.815 --> 00:22:15.766
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But to answer your question in short, no,
it stays with us at the minute here, OK?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/148-1
00:22:15.766 --> 00:22:17.812
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.
Because you can see from some of the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/148-2
00:22:17.812 --> 00:22:21.001
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>process lots of complex,
there's complexities as well. So we yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/148-3
00:22:21.001 --> 00:22:24.856
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so we tried simple billing with the PS
and they still have that option they they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/148-4
00:22:24.856 --> 00:22:28.235
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>can process a simple billing,
but complex ones they they're still with</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/148-5
00:22:28.235 --> 00:22:28.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>us here.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/149-0
00:22:29.095 --> 00:22:35.771
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I think there's a sort of wider
business decision not driven by the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/149-1
00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:41.694
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing team on this one.
So it's a discussion that we've been</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/149-2
00:22:41.694 --> 00:22:47.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>having and it is actually driven
sometimes by the capacity.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/150-0
00:22:47.815 --> 00:22:53.207
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So if we look at to just give you a bit
of background, the capacity of,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/150-1
00:22:53.207 --> 00:22:58.674
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>if we look at what APE does in Australia,
they're doing lots of billing,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/150-2
00:22:58.674 --> 00:23:02.043
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but not as much BD support. Yeah,
in the UK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/150-3
00:23:02.043 --> 00:23:07.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they're probably doing more BD support,
less billing. So right now.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/151-0
00:23:07.375 --> 00:23:14.198
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The capacity doesn't exist and also
because the capacity that doesn't exist,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/151-1
00:23:14.198 --> 00:23:19.957
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there's no desire necessarily to have a
lot of people upskilled,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/151-2
00:23:19.957 --> 00:23:22.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>hence why when we've tried to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/152-0
00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:26.675
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Push billing because the partners want it,
right?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/152-1
00:23:26.675 --> 00:23:31.558
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But the partners probably don't
understand some of the complexities.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/152-2
00:23:31.558 --> 00:23:35.168
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But the partners say I just want my PE to
do this,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/152-3
00:23:35.168 --> 00:23:40.618
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we haven't got the right skills
always and capacity in our PE community.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/152-4
00:23:40.618 --> 00:23:42.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So for us to actually.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/153-0
00:23:42.695 --> 00:23:47.222
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Decentralised billing,
which is an ongoing discussion across the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/153-1
00:23:47.222 --> 00:23:49.868
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>firm.
We actually have to realign our</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/153-2
00:23:49.868 --> 00:23:53.977
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>resourcing profile,
which is a wholly different challenge.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/153-3
00:23:53.977 --> 00:23:59.270
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's an operating model and roles,
responsibilities change because I was</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/153-4
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just trying to work out because if it's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/154-0
00:24:02.375 --> 00:24:05.061
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know,
P ES that are doing it in Australia.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/154-1
00:24:05.061 --> 00:24:09.004
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Then if they have an issue,
if they need support so they do come to,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/154-2
00:24:09.004 --> 00:24:13.633
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they come to the UK team which is well
they come to Sandeep's team in Australia.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/154-3
00:24:13.633 --> 00:24:16.661
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK they do.
Lisa Allenson's team will give them some</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/154-4
00:24:16.661 --> 00:24:17.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing support.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/155-0
00:24:18.215 --> 00:24:22.298
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Got it. OK. So for instance,
like she does all the billing reversals,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/155-1
00:24:22.298 --> 00:24:26.088
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>doesn't she? Yeah. Yeah.
And that is also one of the tasks which</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/155-2
00:24:26.088 --> 00:24:30.753
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we have put under the service catalogue
watch list to try and see if that could</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/155-3
00:24:30.753 --> 00:24:34.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>be done by the PS as well.
So something to discuss about.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/156-0
00:24:34.535 --> 00:24:42.244
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's just not going to be a quick it's
not a quick thing of turning a tap off</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/156-1
00:24:42.244 --> 00:24:48.371
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and turning a tap on.
We tried it it the the peas didn't have</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/156-2
00:24:48.371 --> 00:24:49.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>capacity nor.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/157-0
00:24:50.415 --> 00:24:55.752
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Desire to increase their capability and
knowledge, which meant it was failing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/157-1
00:24:55.752 --> 00:25:00.413
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So these guys were having to drop in
anyway. If we were to go ahead,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/157-2
00:25:00.413 --> 00:25:05.750
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we'd have to balance the resource and
therefore we'd have a slightly different</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/157-3
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:09.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>model here in Glasgow,
which would be around the business.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/158-0
00:25:09.815 --> 00:25:15.758
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The assurance of billing and support more
than the work that they're doing at the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/158-1
00:25:15.758 --> 00:25:19.382
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>moment,
so it would be a change and what we would</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/158-2
00:25:19.382 --> 00:25:22.860
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>deliver,
but it's just not come up to be honest</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/158-3
00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:27.789
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>with you. It's not a priority.
The effort to get it done versus the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/158-4
00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:29.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>priorities is you know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/159-0
00:25:29.615 --> 00:25:31.878
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And for the film,
this isn't top of the Pops.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/159-1
00:25:31.878 --> 00:25:34.584
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So for phase one,
it remains exactly as it is today in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/159-2
00:25:34.584 --> 00:25:38.322
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>terms of how we we operate and we just
need to make sure that we've got the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/159-3
00:25:38.322 --> 00:25:41.422
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>right services to support that as well.
Yeah. Yeah. So in, in,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/159-4
00:25:41.422 --> 00:25:45.111
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>in terms of support as well to we are
driven like on, on, on the last day.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/159-5
00:25:45.111 --> 00:25:49.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So like the end of the month like last
year of the month, you know that's where.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/160-0
00:25:49.135 --> 00:25:52.154
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Your targets, etcetera are kind of like,
you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/160-1
00:25:52.154 --> 00:25:57.008
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>bashed in on on the last and and there is
a cut off of the system as well like to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/160-2
00:25:57.008 --> 00:26:00.026
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>make sure you know from an accounting
perspective.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/160-3
00:26:00.026 --> 00:26:03.519
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So like 3E has a cut off of half ten in
the UK after that,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/160-4
00:26:03.519 --> 00:26:08.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>anything you process is goes on the
following months of the books, right? So.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/161-0
00:26:08.455 --> 00:26:12.673
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If you consider each of the regional
locations so like say, starting from,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/161-1
00:26:12.673 --> 00:26:15.203
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know Middle East to Europe coming to
us,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/161-2
00:26:15.203 --> 00:26:18.520
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>their cut offs are like an hour two hours
earlier than us.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/161-3
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.962
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we still provide support to them if
they have missed out something in their</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/161-4
00:26:22.962 --> 00:26:27.180
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>cut off then and something urgent
something high value is there they would</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/161-5
00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>come after their.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/162-0
00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:32.928
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Cut off to us for our team to kind of
like purchase the building.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/162-1
00:26:32.928 --> 00:26:37.771
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What it means is that generally,
apart from the regional taxation or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/162-2
00:26:37.771 --> 00:26:41.702
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>regional regulatory,
you know nuances and generally the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/162-3
00:26:41.702 --> 00:26:43.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>process is very much.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/163-0
00:26:43.575 --> 00:26:46.198
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know similar in in in how the Bills
are generated. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/163-1
00:26:46.198 --> 00:26:49.810
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's what's going to ask is even though
you got those local variances in terms of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/163-2
00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.347
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>like, cuts off days,
but the billing method and process is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/163-3
00:26:52.347 --> 00:26:55.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>still the same across each of those
regions as well. Yeah. OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/164-0
00:26:57.055 --> 00:26:59.563
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, that's good. OK.
Should make a sound.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/164-1
00:26:59.563 --> 00:27:03.494
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Or maybe come back to yourself with an
overview. I know that. Sorry.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/164-2
00:27:03.494 --> 00:27:07.938
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Apologies that we diverted a bit and
that'd be very helpful. Thank you. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/164-3
00:27:07.938 --> 00:27:10.559
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Well,
I just think maybe we'll action all the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/164-4
00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:12.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing for the the UK mainly. Oh, sorry.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/165-0
00:27:13.655 --> 00:27:18.536
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And some of the European teams aim,
but it depends.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/165-1
00:27:18.536 --> 00:27:23.980
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There's just so many variance ways they
can request them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/165-2
00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:30.832
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There's a few matters that we will issue
automatically and how on asset,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/165-3
00:27:30.832 --> 00:27:32.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>monthly or whatnot.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/166-0
00:27:33.255 --> 00:27:38.103
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Scheduled. Yeah, yeah. Scheduled ones.
There's not many of them,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/166-1
00:27:38.103 --> 00:27:42.503
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but there are a few.
But the majority of all requests just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/166-2
00:27:42.503 --> 00:27:46.531
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>come in as and when the partner wants
invoice issued.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/166-3
00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:49.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And it's almost as as basic as that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/167-0
00:27:49.615 --> 00:27:54.454
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then there's all the different ones
that can come in as they're starting</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/167-1
00:27:54.454 --> 00:27:58.727
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>looking into the billing,
you might get a lot of requests for write</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/167-2
00:27:58.727 --> 00:28:01.869
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>offs, transfers, transfers,
just time amendments,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/167-3
00:28:01.869 --> 00:28:06.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>etcetera in there are not to one thing.
That's how we get an awful lot of them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/168-0
00:28:07.575 --> 00:28:13.030
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And and it can come back and forth until
they actually get to ready to get the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/168-1
00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.759
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>invoice out. Other ones just come in now.
Very basic.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/168-2
00:28:16.759 --> 00:28:22.559
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Can you build this matter at X amount and
it's issue just like that but again there</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/168-3
00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:24.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>may be quite a few back and forths.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/169-0
00:28:25.655 --> 00:28:30.368
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If it's an E billing client,
we would check what information is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/169-1
00:28:30.368 --> 00:28:34.049
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>required and they might not have provided
at all.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/169-2
00:28:34.049 --> 00:28:38.761
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They may warn part payment applied which
again depended on and.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/169-3
00:28:38.761 --> 00:28:42.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We might then to go back and forth to
cashiers.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/170-0
00:28:45.255 --> 00:28:47.997
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Or they might want an invoice reverse
that's been settled.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/170-1
00:28:47.997 --> 00:28:50.878
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We need to go back to.
So there's a lot of back and forth for</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/170-2
00:28:50.878 --> 00:28:53.945
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the other teams in the matter.
Might not be quite set up with the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/170-3
00:28:53.945 --> 00:28:57.337
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>correct address details. So again,
we need to go back and forth and then</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/170-4
00:28:57.337 --> 00:29:00.544
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>liaise with the rates and matter admin
team for them to set that up,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/170-5
00:29:00.544 --> 00:29:02.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>seeing if there's any changes to the rate.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/171-0
00:29:03.055 --> 00:29:09.217
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's it's all very back and forth,
quite a lot and we've seen that this week</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/171-1
00:29:09.217 --> 00:29:15.379
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and I suppose that automatically triggers
into if you had the right information</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/171-2
00:29:15.379 --> 00:29:17.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>upfront first time, correct.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/172-0
00:29:18.175 --> 00:29:22.257
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Or triggered, you know,
probably make that complex billing mean.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/172-1
00:29:22.257 --> 00:29:26.213
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Not not. I'm suggesting it becomes SIM.
Maybe simpler billing,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/172-2
00:29:26.213 --> 00:29:29.729
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but and that's probably what we'll get
into, but again,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/172-3
00:29:29.729 --> 00:29:34.564
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>not trivialising it at all. You know,
but trying to make that process simple</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/172-4
00:29:34.564 --> 00:29:34.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/173-0
00:29:35.575 --> 00:29:38.158
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You're you're creating, you know,
a new bill.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/173-1
00:29:38.158 --> 00:29:42.593
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's work in progress and closing it,
and you've got these multiple scenarios.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/173-2
00:29:42.593 --> 00:29:45.120
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And as I said,
we'll get into each of those,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/173-3
00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.330
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but I'm not trying to say that, gosh,
that she's just made it sound simple</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/173-4
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because I appreciate that it isn't.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/174-0
00:29:51.735 --> 00:29:55.459
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But ServiceNow is great at workflows,
so you're processing it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/174-1
00:29:55.459 --> 00:29:58.651
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It comes in as a query,
probably into Cherwell today.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/174-2
00:29:58.651 --> 00:30:02.080
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is that correct,
generated from three E that they want to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/174-3
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.153
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>generate?
Is that how it starts its life or can you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/174-4
00:30:05.153 --> 00:30:06.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>get them in, in any?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/175-0
00:30:07.135 --> 00:30:10.340
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It would come in mainly we've got the
mixture they can,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/175-1
00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:14.861
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we've got a simple pro forma pro forma
approval process where at the P sort of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/175-2
00:30:14.861 --> 00:30:18.524
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>generates a pro forma. Oh, they do,
they do that, do they? Yes.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/175-3
00:30:18.524 --> 00:30:23.274
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So they'll generate the pro formas first
and they provide the billing guides to on</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/175-4
00:30:23.274 --> 00:30:26.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the back of whip and credit control and
then going into.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/176-0
00:30:26.655 --> 00:30:29.412
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Pro forma, yeah,
they would do that or just the partner</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/176-1
00:30:29.412 --> 00:30:31.971
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>asking them,
I think a lot of the times the partner</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/176-2
00:30:31.971 --> 00:30:34.432
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>will go right,
give me billing guides on which is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/176-3
00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:38.025
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>effectively a draught invoice of the of
the pre invoice of your invoice,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/176-4
00:30:38.025 --> 00:30:40.634
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>all the information,
it's all broken down in detail.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/176-5
00:30:40.634 --> 00:30:41.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They'll go through that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/178-0
00:30:43.095 --> 00:30:47.254
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then just tell the PE either request
an invoice or you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/178-1
00:30:47.254 --> 00:30:52.372
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>mark up with all the different amendments
the PS get the option if it's just if</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/178-2
00:30:52.372 --> 00:30:56.210
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they're requesting an invoice and it's
pretty standard now,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/178-3
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:59.472
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>nothing with Greek complex,
no splits or anything,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/178-4
00:30:59.472 --> 00:31:01.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they can submit it through the free.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/179-0
00:31:01.815 --> 00:31:07.117
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>PE finance system so that appears on like
we've got a sort of action list on more</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/179-1
00:31:07.117 --> 00:31:11.126
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>dashboards and we just access each one if
they come in. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/179-2
00:31:11.126 --> 00:31:15.587
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And some basic instructions on it.
And Bella and then when we Bella,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/179-3
00:31:15.587 --> 00:31:17.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it goes straight back to the PE.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/180-0
00:31:18.335 --> 00:31:22.660
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Or they can submit,
they're just sending an e-mail in,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/180-1
00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:27.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and when that comes to us,
that street and to brochure, well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/180-2
00:31:27.535 --> 00:31:29.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>a sort of a desk that's just.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/181-0
00:31:27.935 --> 00:31:33.120
<v Mark Sedge>Can I just? Sorry, can I ask? Sorry.
Can I ask just one quick question in that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/181-1
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.335
<v Mark Sedge>pro forma,
are there any any sort of controls to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/181-2
00:31:36.335 --> 00:31:41.519
<v Mark Sedge>ensure you get the right data populated
or is it all just sort of kind of like</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/181-3
00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:42.175
<v Mark Sedge>free form?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/184-0
00:31:42.535 --> 00:31:46.148
<v Mark Sedge>Because if you've got a lot of failure
demand coming through your organisation</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/184-1
00:31:46.148 --> 00:31:49.303
<v Mark Sedge>because data is missing or there's,
you know, the various, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/183-0
00:31:47.415 --> 00:31:47.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/184-2
00:31:49.303 --> 00:31:52.870
<v Mark Sedge>anomalies and other bits and pieces,
it does that pro forma have any controls</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/184-3
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:56.712
<v Mark Sedge>on it because ServiceNow would give you a
bit of control in terms of what they gave</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/184-4
00:31:56.712 --> 00:31:58.724
<v Mark Sedge>you.
I just want to get an understanding of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/184-5
00:31:58.724 --> 00:31:59.775
<v Mark Sedge>that, if I may, please.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/185-0
00:32:00.295 --> 00:32:00.415
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/186-0
00:32:00.975 --> 00:32:05.318
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, there's lots of information on it.
The the sort of billing gate,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/186-1
00:32:05.318 --> 00:32:10.028
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the gate will give all the detail like
the client name, the default address,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/186-2
00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:14.555
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the billing contacts, etcetera.
And there's options beside them to see is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/186-3
00:32:14.555 --> 00:32:16.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>this correct? Should it be changed?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/187-0
00:32:17.295 --> 00:32:20.389
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It gives them all the information about
the dates.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/187-1
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:24.272
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think half the time to be quite honest,
nobody looks at them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/187-2
00:32:24.272 --> 00:32:29.064
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They they just see Bella and then I mean
we've even at times we send a draught</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/187-3
00:32:29.064 --> 00:32:31.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>invoice for reviewing the goal.
That's perfect.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/188-0
00:32:32.455 --> 00:32:35.307
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Can you finalise it?
We finalise it and then they come back</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/188-1
00:32:35.307 --> 00:32:37.825
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and go. Oh,
that's got the wrong address on it or we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/189-0
00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:42.072
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So that's and this is,
I think this is we've seen this a lot and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/188-2
00:32:37.825 --> 00:32:38.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>didn't want this so.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/189-1
00:32:42.072 --> 00:32:46.675
<v Mark Sedge>I think Deborah sort of touched on it
that they, you know, a lot of your,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/189-2
00:32:46.675 --> 00:32:49.475
<v Mark Sedge>a lot of your demand.
You know as I call it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/189-3
00:32:49.475 --> 00:32:54.575
<v Mark Sedge>failure demand because you're having to
respond to something that hasn't come in.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/190-0
00:32:55.015 --> 00:32:58.586
<v Mark Sedge>You're someone hasn't done an activity
upstream effectively,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/190-1
00:32:58.586 --> 00:33:03.035
<v Mark Sedge>so one of the things we need to think
about just broadly is when when we go</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/190-2
00:33:03.035 --> 00:33:07.015
<v Mark Sedge>through this is you know,
ServiceNow will have a certain element of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/190-3
00:33:07.015 --> 00:33:11.523
<v Mark Sedge>the controls that you're looking for.
But there is a piece of organisational</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/190-4
00:33:11.523 --> 00:33:14.215
<v Mark Sedge>challenge or whatever that needs to go up
to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/191-0
00:33:14.255 --> 00:33:14.695
<v Mark Sedge>Say uh.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/192-0
00:33:14.775 --> 00:33:17.328
<v Mark Sedge>Actually,
these people need to take their job</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/192-1
00:33:17.328 --> 00:33:21.933
<v Mark Sedge>seriously and I'm being very blunt there.
Forgive me that if you're being asked to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/192-2
00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:25.207
<v Mark Sedge>approve something,
you should be checking it and approving</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/192-3
00:33:25.207 --> 00:33:29.202
<v Mark Sedge>so. So as we go through this,
we we might need to be thinking about how</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/192-4
00:33:29.202 --> 00:33:33.586
<v Mark Sedge>we can collect data to enable you to be
able to go back or feed up the line to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/192-5
00:33:33.586 --> 00:33:34.695
<v Mark Sedge>say we X this month.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/193-0
00:33:34.775 --> 00:33:38.850
<v Mark Sedge>If we did this amount of hours just
cleaning up because these areas didn't do</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/193-1
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.567
<v Mark Sedge>an approval properly or whatever,
just you with me.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/193-2
00:33:41.567 --> 00:33:45.746
<v Mark Sedge>So have a little think about that as we
go through because I think it will help</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/193-3
00:33:45.746 --> 00:33:49.455
<v Mark Sedge>when Deborah's sort of running through
the processes that makes sense.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/194-0
00:33:49.015 --> 00:33:52.028
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, we picked it up.
We rate some matter yesterday as they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/194-1
00:33:52.028 --> 00:33:54.251
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>said,
they got an address change and then it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/194-2
00:33:54.251 --> 00:33:58.004
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>gets applied to the client and then it
should have only been applied to the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/194-3
00:33:58.004 --> 00:34:00.918
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>matter. You know,
there were lots of things that they also</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/194-4
00:34:00.918 --> 00:34:04.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>said yesterday that they need to reverse
and make sure that happened.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/195-0
00:34:05.455 --> 00:34:09.394
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think it's probably an overarching work
for change as well. Yeah, joy,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/195-1
00:34:09.394 --> 00:34:11.929
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just in terms of how we can do it
effectively,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/195-2
00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:15.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we've tried right in the past. So.
So if you're thinking around that might</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/195-3
00:34:15.975 --> 00:34:19.374
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>be really helpful, yeah,
where do you save your billing guides</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/195-4
00:34:19.374 --> 00:34:23.744
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>right now, I'm sorry, but to be safe,
yeah. I mean, where are they located like,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/195-5
00:34:23.744 --> 00:34:24.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is that?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/196-0
00:34:24.295 --> 00:34:28.583
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And in tap terms or the billing which the
lines guides. Oh yes.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/196-1
00:34:28.583 --> 00:34:33.942
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And I mean we don't save some stored if
it be either on because we don't always</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/196-2
00:34:33.942 --> 00:34:37.425
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>get one.
You don't have to provide a billing guide.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/196-3
00:34:37.425 --> 00:34:41.980
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So who should be get giving it to us.
So basically to Mark's point,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/196-4
00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>if you're trying to build a.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/197-0
00:34:43.935 --> 00:34:47.245
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Control,
but the exact data is captured in the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/197-1
00:34:47.245 --> 00:34:50.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing guidelines.
Then how do we sync that in?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/198-0
00:34:53.815 --> 00:34:56.878
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. I mean,
I think the process has always been the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/198-1
00:34:56.878 --> 00:35:01.585
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the billing guides more for the benefit
of the partner, Fiona, etcetera to review.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/198-2
00:35:01.585 --> 00:35:04.080
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Quite often they'll attach a billing
guide,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/198-3
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.560
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they don't complete it anyway or they
complete bits of it and then they change</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/198-4
00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and there's never been a requirement that
they have to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/199-0
00:35:11.815 --> 00:35:16.113
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Give us a completely billing guide. Yeah,
I'll, I'll rephrase the question.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/199-1
00:35:16.113 --> 00:35:18.884
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So if they,
if you get a proper accurate billing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/199-2
00:35:18.884 --> 00:35:21.315
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>guide,
will that sort out your problems of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/199-3
00:35:21.315 --> 00:35:24.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>inaccuracies of rates and addresses and
everything?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/200-0
00:35:26.055 --> 00:35:26.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/201-0
00:35:26.255 --> 00:35:29.032
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Because that's your evidence.
That's your proof, right?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/201-1
00:35:29.032 --> 00:35:32.502
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That you are following the guideline and
you are invoicing it as per.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/201-2
00:35:32.502 --> 00:35:36.518
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean they've never come back or some
have never come back and says you've done</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/201-3
00:35:36.518 --> 00:35:39.344
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it wrong. They just come back and go.
Oh yeah. Yeah, no,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/201-4
00:35:39.344 --> 00:35:42.764
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they've not looked at it.
And quite often they do tick and say yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/201-5
00:35:42.764 --> 00:35:46.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's correct. That's correct.
And then come back later on and go.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/202-0
00:35:46.255 --> 00:35:50.491
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Or that's not the address I want.
So I think a lot of the times when</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/202-1
00:35:50.491 --> 00:35:53.990
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they're doing the sort of tick box of the
billing guide,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/202-2
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:58.839
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they're not actually paying attention or
they've realised later on it changes.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/202-3
00:35:58.839 --> 00:36:02.952
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's sick. So you know,
is every bill does every bill for every</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/202-4
00:36:02.952 --> 00:36:05.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>matter get a billing guide or is it
specific?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/203-0
00:36:06.135 --> 00:36:09.620
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Matters that would get a billing guide.
Everyone can have one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/203-1
00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:14.100
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's up to them if they print off so they
can some. When you create a pro forma,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/203-2
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:18.580
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you've got the option then to print off a
billing guide for it. Or if they want,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/203-3
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they can just actually print off a
draught invoice.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/204-0
00:36:22.175 --> 00:36:24.621
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's up to the whoever is generally
the Sir,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/204-1
00:36:24.621 --> 00:36:27.525
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>potentially the partner or the PE
potentially who, yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/204-2
00:36:27.525 --> 00:36:31.397
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it will probably be what the partner asks
for. I mean sometimes they don't,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/204-3
00:36:31.397 --> 00:36:34.913
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they don't print any. I mean,
sometimes we'll get a request and they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/204-4
00:36:34.913 --> 00:36:38.683
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>won't have generated a pro forma,
but they just they'll be just know like</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/204-5
00:36:38.683 --> 00:36:40.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that matter we want to build that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/205-0
00:36:40.895 --> 00:36:44.188
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>X amount in.
I mean it's an opportunity there that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/205-1
00:36:44.188 --> 00:36:49.353
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing guide to say this was the address
you know those those pain points that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/205-2
00:36:49.353 --> 00:36:53.033
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you're saying,
but maybe that's the change for the PD to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/205-3
00:36:53.033 --> 00:36:57.811
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>say this is your, this is this,
this is the solution it's landed on is is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/205-4
00:36:57.811 --> 00:37:00.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it correct? Yes. And then it's just.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/206-0
00:37:01.295 --> 00:37:06.693
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Do we make it mandatory for bills?
But I think we're all thinking the exact</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/206-1
00:37:06.693 --> 00:37:10.599
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>same thing. And you know,
if we think there's benefit,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/206-2
00:37:10.599 --> 00:37:16.210
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>if it's not an over elaborate process
that adds no less value and it helps the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/206-3
00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:18.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing process, then we should be.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/207-0
00:37:20.015 --> 00:37:23.042
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And you know,
an edict that that's how we operate.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/207-1
00:37:23.042 --> 00:37:27.611
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think it's we just need to understand
why they don't want to use it. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/207-2
00:37:27.611 --> 00:37:30.400
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's what I just want to say because
for me,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/207-3
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.207
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm thinking for every bill there should
be a billing guide and that's mandatory</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/207-4
00:37:35.207 --> 00:37:36.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and it helps you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/208-0
00:37:37.055 --> 00:37:40.268
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's not going to solve everything,
but it helps you to reduce some of those</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/208-1
00:37:40.268 --> 00:37:42.104
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>errors and issues that keep coming
through.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/208-2
00:37:42.104 --> 00:37:45.483
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But is there a reason why some of those
PES or partners are like I don't need it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/208-3
00:37:45.483 --> 00:37:48.737
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>for this this particular matter or
actually yes, I need it for this one here.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/208-4
00:37:48.737 --> 00:37:51.491
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I'm just trying to work out when and
why would they choose it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/208-5
00:37:51.491 --> 00:37:54.995
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What's the use cases that really helps to?
I think it would probably be more likely</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/208-6
00:37:54.995 --> 00:37:56.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to be the partners rather than the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/209-0
00:37:56.575 --> 00:38:00.825
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Fees that are making that call,
that that should be saved somewhere like</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/209-1
00:38:00.825 --> 00:38:03.619
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know,
like engagement letters and all other</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/209-2
00:38:03.619 --> 00:38:06.588
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>contractuals,
you know which are set up in in that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/209-3
00:38:06.588 --> 00:38:09.323
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>terms,
if they have a guideline then it should</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/209-4
00:38:09.323 --> 00:38:11.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>be stored somewhere centrally as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/210-0
00:38:12.055 --> 00:38:15.722
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I was just going to ask that GAIL.
So you mentioned that they might print</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/210-1
00:38:15.722 --> 00:38:18.817
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>off the billing guide etcetera,
where do they print it off from,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/210-2
00:38:18.817 --> 00:38:21.245
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is it in three East,
where is it that stuff? Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/210-3
00:38:21.245 --> 00:38:25.006
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just in the when once I've generated the
pro forma and that's where like if we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/210-4
00:38:25.006 --> 00:38:27.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>were going to issue the invoice,
we go into the pro forma.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/211-0
00:38:28.575 --> 00:38:32.111
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Same with the PE.
They would go in and print a billing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/211-1
00:38:32.111 --> 00:38:35.647
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>guide from there,
or a draught invoice if they wanted,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/211-2
00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:40.212
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>or nothing at all. If it's OK.
And I guess that information comes from</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/211-3
00:38:40.212 --> 00:38:44.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the MBI when it's all set up and started
like what generate what,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/211-4
00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:48.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>where do we get the information and that
billing guide.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/212-0
00:38:48.215 --> 00:38:48.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And three.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/213-0
00:38:48.695 --> 00:38:51.616
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Where does that come from?
And you might not know the answer.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/213-1
00:38:51.616 --> 00:38:54.631
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's fine if you don't. Yeah,
I think I was just set up through</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/213-2
00:38:54.631 --> 00:38:58.306
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>probably financial systems at the the
time I I think it will be a combination</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/213-3
00:38:58.306 --> 00:39:00.567
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of like data points because NBI will have
it's,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/213-4
00:39:00.567 --> 00:39:03.017
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's the first form first point of data
collection.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/213-5
00:39:03.017 --> 00:39:06.832
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it might not have all the information
but then see the engagement letters and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/213-6
00:39:06.832 --> 00:39:08.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the the negotiations on the discount.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/214-0
00:39:08.735 --> 00:39:12.609
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ETC. So it will be different data points.
You've provided a copy of an example</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/214-1
00:39:12.609 --> 00:39:16.385
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing guide so that we can see what
that looks like and just give us every</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/214-2
00:39:16.385 --> 00:39:20.454
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>synopsis around where it comes from. Yeah,
I was just going to kind of say like to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/214-3
00:39:20.454 --> 00:39:24.034
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that point as well that some of the
billing guide will be pre populated.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/214-4
00:39:24.034 --> 00:39:26.289
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But at that point they can add to it as
well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/214-5
00:39:26.289 --> 00:39:28.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So say if they've been provided with like
a.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/215-0
00:39:28.775 --> 00:39:30.846
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>From the client you can add that on for
us.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/215-1
00:39:30.846 --> 00:39:33.715
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Or if there's maybe some information they
want to add, well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/215-2
00:39:33.715 --> 00:39:37.150
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's to be written off or something
like that. They can at that point,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/215-3
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.220
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>excuse me at that point,
add that manually.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/215-4
00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's not always got everything in the
billing guide.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/215-5
00:39:41.855 --> 00:39:45.289
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So they might print that off,
but give you additional information. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/215-6
00:39:45.289 --> 00:39:48.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But they can add that to the billing
guide. So it will just come to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/216-0
00:39:48.655 --> 00:39:52.767
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>US as one document. OK. Right. Cool. Yeah,
we'll take that as an action.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/216-1
00:39:52.767 --> 00:39:56.258
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We'll follow in those cases,
they don't probably complete it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/216-2
00:39:56.258 --> 00:39:59.581
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Do you agree? I mean,
probably even the majority of cases,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/216-3
00:39:59.581 --> 00:40:03.298
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we don't see one. Yeah, but.
And this has been the issue. I mean,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/216-4
00:40:03.298 --> 00:40:07.296
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Lynn and I am trying to solve an issue
about currencies being changed,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/216-5
00:40:07.296 --> 00:40:08.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we don't have any.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/217-0
00:40:08.615 --> 00:40:12.488
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The agreement on who and how they have
asked us to change the currency,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/217-1
00:40:12.488 --> 00:40:15.446
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so if it is documented somewhere,
at least for future,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/217-2
00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:18.726
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we know that it should be this even if it
is a manual error.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/217-3
00:40:18.726 --> 00:40:22.706
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But we don't have those records,
I'm issuing currency the agreed currency</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/217-4
00:40:22.706 --> 00:40:26.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>with the client would also be in the
billing guide or within the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/218-0
00:40:27.015 --> 00:40:30.262
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Contract that's agreed right? Or the MSA?
Yeah, it would.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/218-1
00:40:30.262 --> 00:40:34.125
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It would show on the billing gate as well.
What, again, quite often,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/218-2
00:40:34.125 --> 00:40:38.659
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they will at time with Berlin decide to
change that. Yeah, we touched upon that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/218-3
00:40:38.659 --> 00:40:41.905
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What, yesterday,
why there might be a reason why suddenly</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/218-4
00:40:41.905 --> 00:40:46.160
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they want to change it in a different
currency or whatever reason. So yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/218-5
00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:46.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we touched.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/219-0
00:40:46.935 --> 00:40:50.032
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That was very helpful. Thank you.
Just just a quick question on that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/219-1
00:40:50.032 --> 00:40:53.261
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Obviously, earlier in the week,
I was talking about things where clients</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/219-2
00:40:53.261 --> 00:40:55.826
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>don't pay for things like research.
For example. Example,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/219-3
00:40:55.826 --> 00:40:59.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>was that done in the billing guides as
well as at client level or is it?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/221-0
00:41:00.415 --> 00:41:04.263
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If there was like sort of time had been
posted in respect of that,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/221-1
00:41:04.263 --> 00:41:08.801
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that wasn't to be like, see chargeable,
then yes, they'll be probably on that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/221-2
00:41:08.801 --> 00:41:13.338
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There will be some time entries that
they'll go through and just go right off.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/221-3
00:41:13.338 --> 00:41:15.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Now this one that one, that one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/222-0
00:41:16.695 --> 00:41:20.955
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We wouldn't really pay too much attention
to what it related to, but yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/222-1
00:41:20.955 --> 00:41:25.157
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>quite often you'll see ones even maybe
like the sort of now spending time</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/222-2
00:41:25.157 --> 00:41:29.303
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>looking over planning, then voice,
and then there'll be a timing because</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/222-3
00:41:29.303 --> 00:41:32.313
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I've posted it,
but obviously they'll write that off</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/222-4
00:41:32.313 --> 00:41:35.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because they've been charged that to the
client.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/223-0
00:41:35.175 --> 00:41:38.568
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So probably other time,
sometimes travel time they would,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/223-1
00:41:38.568 --> 00:41:42.312
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know, how you'll see them now.
We don't want to, if agreed,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/223-2
00:41:42.312 --> 00:41:46.231
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>not to charge that to the client.
So we'll write that off as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/223-3
00:41:46.231 --> 00:41:50.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But if it was on the matter, I am, yeah.
OK, that's good. I mean that was a.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/224-0
00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:54.664
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean,
we've probably captured four or five away</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/224-1
00:41:54.664 --> 00:41:58.072
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to the processes already, I mean,
not necessarily do them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/224-2
00:41:58.072 --> 00:42:02.750
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I was going to start if you have a look
at maybe you could just click on this TQ</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/224-3
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:07.371
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm a recommendation which is in column E
I've put them into sort of discussion</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/224-4
00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:07.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>points.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/225-0
00:42:08.855 --> 00:42:12.887
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Maybe you could just click on the drop
down. For me, Jimmy, and I've,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/225-1
00:42:12.887 --> 00:42:16.112
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there was some complex.
I've sort of invoice, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/225-2
00:42:16.112 --> 00:42:20.546
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's a big subject matter and that would
just be everything we talked about.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/225-3
00:42:20.546 --> 00:42:24.808
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But I had some sort of manage invoice and
it was complex complex invoice.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/225-4
00:42:24.808 --> 00:42:27.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I've sort of pulled out that even though
it would sit.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/226-0
00:42:28.015 --> 00:42:30.723
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Within the same sort of service and
workflow,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/226-1
00:42:30.723 --> 00:42:33.665
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I thought it was worthy of its unique
discussion.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/226-2
00:42:33.665 --> 00:42:38.314
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then you've got these manage time
card section and the others were sort of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/226-3
00:42:38.314 --> 00:42:42.022
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>queries reports and as you said from WIPP
that we could cover.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/226-4
00:42:42.022 --> 00:42:43.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's probably worth.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/227-0
00:42:44.175 --> 00:42:48.339
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Starting should we start with the whip?
Because that's probably an entry point,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/227-1
00:42:48.339 --> 00:42:52.398
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>whip and credit control, if that's OK,
that probably comes from the pro forma</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/227-2
00:42:52.398 --> 00:42:55.833
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and then into the invoice.
Is that a natural progression that you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/227-3
00:42:55.833 --> 00:42:59.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>think would be useful in terms of how we
go through the process?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/228-0
00:43:00.695 --> 00:43:04.679
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
So if you could just highlight the all</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/228-1
00:43:04.679 --> 00:43:08.246
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the whip ones for me.
And I know whip Marwan's on the call.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/228-2
00:43:08.246 --> 00:43:12.884
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Whip and credit control is next week,
but this is probably these are the have</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/228-3
00:43:12.884 --> 00:43:17.522
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>been under your umbrella of billing
process for whip and we could have a look</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/228-4
00:43:17.522 --> 00:43:20.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>at those and maybe discuss them and sort
of as.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/229-0
00:43:20.775 --> 00:43:24.562
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Of what you do.
So there's transferring time as part of a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/229-1
00:43:24.562 --> 00:43:29.197
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing plug in time. You know,
maybe that's a retrospective activity,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/229-2
00:43:29.197 --> 00:43:32.592
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but if we could have a look at that as an
overview,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/229-3
00:43:32.592 --> 00:43:36.117
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>maybe you can give me a sort of summary
of, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/229-4
00:43:36.117 --> 00:43:40.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>credit bills or do you have to issue a
credit note or are they?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/230-0
00:43:40.615 --> 00:43:45.169
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Are they pre activity that the whip and
the control group do that then inherit</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/230-1
00:43:45.169 --> 00:43:45.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>into yourself?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/231-0
00:43:47.255 --> 00:43:50.226
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's sort of pre pro forma or are they
post?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/231-1
00:43:50.226 --> 00:43:54.253
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Are they part of the post activity that
you're you're doing?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/231-2
00:43:54.253 --> 00:43:56.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean the top one with cancellation?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/232-0
00:43:59.015 --> 00:44:01.949
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Could. Well,
it's sort of post because that's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/232-1
00:44:01.949 --> 00:44:06.986
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>obviously after an invoice has been
issued and that sort of first one is just,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/232-2
00:44:06.986 --> 00:44:09.919
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>yeah,
for the said cancel it back to when and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/232-3
00:44:09.919 --> 00:44:11.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that would be you you know the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/233-0
00:44:14.055 --> 00:44:17.589
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But decide to review what they're going
to bill with the client,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/233-1
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:21.939
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>or it's probably one that they've put
through from one thing to get the figures</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/233-2
00:44:21.939 --> 00:44:24.113
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>in,
and then it's which is quite common</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/233-3
00:44:24.113 --> 00:44:27.538
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>beginning of the month.
Can you cancel that back to where they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/233-4
00:44:27.538 --> 00:44:29.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>weren't going to send it out anyway?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/234-0
00:44:29.775 --> 00:44:34.342
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So that's just a sort of and they say
that is that APE request that comes in or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/234-1
00:44:34.342 --> 00:44:38.681
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is that something that you discover as we
go through invoice that you think</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/234-2
00:44:38.681 --> 00:44:43.248
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>actually it shouldn't be of this month's
end or when you're going to cancel it?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/234-3
00:44:43.248 --> 00:44:47.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then as an activity,
you would promote rather than a request?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/235-0
00:44:47.775 --> 00:44:50.514
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We wouldn't.
We wouldn't cancel it generally were</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/235-1
00:44:50.514 --> 00:44:54.020
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>sales for that reason,
but the request would come in. But yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/235-2
00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:57.799
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's it's quite a calming.
We have a lot one thing they just they're</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/235-3
00:44:57.799 --> 00:45:02.016
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>putting the bills through because they
they want to meet target but it's not</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/235-4
00:45:02.016 --> 00:45:05.193
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ready to go out.
And then the following week they're like</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/235-5
00:45:05.193 --> 00:45:07.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>reverse that one reverse that one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/236-0
00:45:07.295 --> 00:45:10.020
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And they'll they'll view it.
So just give you a little bit of back</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/236-1
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.785
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>through the partner, right?
So the partner's saying we need to make</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/236-2
00:45:12.785 --> 00:45:14.900
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>my my sales figure for example for the
third month.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/236-3
00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:18.112
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I need to make sure I can pull some
from the whip and then I'll potentially</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/236-4
00:45:18.112 --> 00:45:20.511
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>put it back in. Yeah, so,
so just give you a little bit of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/236-5
00:45:20.511 --> 00:45:23.846
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>background. So before the month starts,
you know there will be various reportings</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/236-6
00:45:23.846 --> 00:45:26.204
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and frequent reportings to the
partnerships and everyone,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/236-7
00:45:26.204 --> 00:45:26.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>every individual.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/237-0
00:45:27.015 --> 00:45:27.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Level.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/238-0
00:45:27.495 --> 00:45:32.656
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Group level saying this is your target or
this is where we want want you to be and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/238-1
00:45:32.656 --> 00:45:37.506
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then at the back of that the team which
you will be meeting them on Monday so</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/238-2
00:45:37.506 --> 00:45:42.294
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they will discuss in more details but
they will be providing the individuals</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/238-3
00:45:42.294 --> 00:45:46.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the group targets or or or the actual
figures as well a lot of times the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/239-0
00:45:47.575 --> 00:45:51.182
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Teams, etcetera will get involved as well.
So the business managers will get</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/239-1
00:45:51.182 --> 00:45:54.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>involved as well and they will try and
you know see that OK, this is actual web,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/239-2
00:45:54.975 --> 00:45:58.628
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but what what is gonna be expected as
well with the help of the partners bees</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/239-3
00:45:58.628 --> 00:46:02.093
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and they'll try and kind of you know like
manage that balance as well and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/239-4
00:46:02.093 --> 00:46:02.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>accordingly.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/240-0
00:46:03.135 --> 00:46:06.721
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Will trigger a change.
Ideally it should be built on the whip,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/240-1
00:46:06.721 --> 00:46:10.477
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know whatever is there,
but those are the scenarios where the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/240-2
00:46:10.477 --> 00:46:14.347
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>changes will happen. Yep,
and I suppose I'm probably thinking a bit</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/240-3
00:46:14.347 --> 00:46:18.901
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>like capturing it upfront so that you
don't get these queries and reversals and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/240-4
00:46:18.901 --> 00:46:21.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>bring it back to whip.
Is there anything that?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/241-0
00:46:22.415 --> 00:46:25.525
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Again,
sort of that trainee or that knowledge</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/241-1
00:46:25.525 --> 00:46:29.784
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>back that they can do to prevent fees or
is it just a regular?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/241-2
00:46:29.784 --> 00:46:34.854
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I know that sounds very simplified,
but it's capturing the net of why they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/241-3
00:46:34.854 --> 00:46:37.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>keep, why you keep getting them,
it's again.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/242-0
00:46:39.655 --> 00:46:43.639
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Lot of practises right like what we were
talking about rates yesterday. You know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/242-1
00:46:43.639 --> 00:46:46.894
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you already have a standard rate,
then you have a volume discount,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/242-2
00:46:46.894 --> 00:46:50.829
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but on top of that there is an agreed you
know negotiated discount and on top of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/242-3
00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:52.966
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that another discount.
So layers in layers.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/242-4
00:46:52.966 --> 00:46:55.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I think it's it's more how that
particular matter or.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/243-0
00:46:56.295 --> 00:46:59.275
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That particular client is being managed,
you know? Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/243-1
00:46:59.275 --> 00:47:02.777
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And it would be good to have a standard
practise, right? But yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/243-2
00:47:02.777 --> 00:47:06.017
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you have a lot of we've got reality on
realities. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/243-3
00:47:06.017 --> 00:47:09.362
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's gonna be really.
That's gonna be really difficult to try</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/243-4
00:47:09.362 --> 00:47:13.439
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and standardise and get and and look,
this is where I think business services</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/243-5
00:47:13.439 --> 00:47:15.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and this is where our job is right to
support.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/244-0
00:47:15.975 --> 00:47:18.768
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The partnership. So I'm I'm in.
I'm I'm neutral right now over here</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/244-1
00:47:18.768 --> 00:47:20.822
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because yes,
we would want to have a standardised</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/244-2
00:47:20.822 --> 00:47:22.917
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>service,
but then what happens if the partnerships</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/244-3
00:47:22.917 --> 00:47:25.669
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>partners, you know, are trying to,
you know, kind of like a crack,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/244-4
00:47:25.669 --> 00:47:28.461
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>a different deal and you're not trying to
give a different numbers.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/244-5
00:47:28.461 --> 00:47:31.131
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We should be available.
We should be ready to make those changes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/244-6
00:47:31.131 --> 00:47:34.047
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>quickly and swiftly as well.
That's what I was going to say. It's not.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/244-7
00:47:34.047 --> 00:47:35.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's not more about changing that
behaviour.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/245-0
00:47:36.015 --> 00:47:39.503
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But how do we quickly support where they
need to be able to do that rather than a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/245-1
00:47:39.503 --> 00:47:42.438
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>complete change of process,
standardising because it's a partnership</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/245-2
00:47:42.438 --> 00:47:44.352
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that it's inevitable that's going to
happen,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/245-3
00:47:44.352 --> 00:47:46.563
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they've got certain targets that they
have to meet.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/245-4
00:47:46.563 --> 00:47:49.711
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So how do we best support them to do that
as quickly as possible? I mean,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/245-5
00:47:49.711 --> 00:47:52.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think it's about how much information
do we get from them or how much.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/246-0
00:47:53.215 --> 00:47:56.014
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>How quickly can we possibly be get it,
you know? Yeah. Also,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/246-1
00:47:56.014 --> 00:47:58.858
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what feedback do you get from partners in
the practise group?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/246-2
00:47:58.858 --> 00:48:01.840
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Because I'm sure you know,
it's not fun for you guys and I don't</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/246-3
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.501
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>think it's fun for them either.
But have they said, like,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/246-4
00:48:04.501 --> 00:48:06.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>actually what would be super helpful is?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/247-0
00:48:07.775 --> 00:48:12.528
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You guys give us this or like what?
What feedback have they given you?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/247-1
00:48:12.528 --> 00:48:17.013
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Just put the bill out as quickly as
possible as accurate possible.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/247-2
00:48:17.013 --> 00:48:19.958
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They don't care how we deliver the
process.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/247-3
00:48:19.958 --> 00:48:24.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They don't want us to burden them. Yeah,
we're business services.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/248-0
00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:28.819
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We're here to get it done.
I think better watch is a Friday.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/248-1
00:48:28.819 --> 00:48:32.367
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Logan may you never know.
He might be in the office,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/248-2
00:48:32.367 --> 00:48:37.723
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but you know there's a typical partner
who you know, business services for him.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/248-3
00:48:37.723 --> 00:48:42.811
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>He doesn't care if it's the billing team
or the risk and compliance team or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/248-4
00:48:42.811 --> 00:48:43.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>whatever. Just.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/249-0
00:48:44.095 --> 00:48:48.877
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sort it, guys. Well, maybe if I dare.
Are they writing names here? Oh, Craig,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/249-1
00:48:48.877 --> 00:48:53.106
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm just worried. It's a Friday,
and sometimes he's in Scotland on a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/249-2
00:48:53.106 --> 00:48:53.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Friday.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/252-0
00:48:54.535 --> 00:48:57.815
<v Mark Sedge>But but but team that,
that's a that's a really good point,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/250-0
00:48:56.735 --> 00:48:58.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yep, that's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/252-1
00:48:57.815 --> 00:49:00.330
<v Mark Sedge>right?
Because if if you if you consider your</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/252-2
00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:04.867
<v Mark Sedge>process with starting with starting with
the customer and working back and looking</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/252-3
00:49:04.867 --> 00:49:08.474
<v Mark Sedge>at what their needs are,
if the service model is we support them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/252-4
00:49:08.474 --> 00:49:12.738
<v Mark Sedge>You know regardless of that you know that
what they are actively doing in the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/251-0
00:49:09.415 --> 00:49:09.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/252-5
00:49:12.738 --> 00:49:13.175
<v Mark Sedge>process.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/255-0
00:49:14.135 --> 00:49:17.216
<v Mark Sedge>Then what?
We just need to do is think about how do</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/255-1
00:49:17.216 --> 00:49:21.423
<v Mark Sedge>we gather the right thing? How do?
What controls do we put in place to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/255-2
00:49:21.423 --> 00:49:25.451
<v Mark Sedge>enable us to aid them without it
overloading or becoming your hyper</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/254-0
00:49:21.855 --> 00:49:21.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/255-3
00:49:25.451 --> 00:49:29.302
<v Mark Sedge>complex? Because clearly there's,
you know, to your point Sandy,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/255-4
00:49:29.302 --> 00:49:32.975
<v Mark Sedge>that you recognise you're there to
support them, but there's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/257-0
00:49:33.175 --> 00:49:37.111
<v Mark Sedge>Boundaries. They still need to, you know,
they still need to help you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/257-1
00:49:37.111 --> 00:49:41.490
<v Mark Sedge>And I think it's our ability to help them
help themselves and then help you be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/256-0
00:49:40.495 --> 00:49:40.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/257-2
00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:44.095
<v Mark Sedge>efficient is the trigger point here,
isn't it?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/258-0
00:49:44.375 --> 00:49:47.696
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.
And I think we are now slightly diverting</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/258-1
00:49:47.696 --> 00:49:51.362
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to the process.
You will know more on Monday because</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/258-2
00:49:51.362 --> 00:49:55.858
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they're already doing that.
They are trying to standardise their</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/258-3
00:49:55.858 --> 00:50:00.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>reporting as much as possible. Moreover,
on being very prompt.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/259-0
00:50:00.535 --> 00:50:03.616
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>To be more supportive to the partners
that hey, by the way,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/259-1
00:50:03.616 --> 00:50:06.850
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>this is what is on week one,
this is how it should be looking.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/259-2
00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:10.752
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>This is what you should be doing.
So I think it's it sits in that area more</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/259-3
00:50:10.752 --> 00:50:14.757
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>than and what I was going to say was
incorporating that into that managing of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/259-4
00:50:14.757 --> 00:50:17.478
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that invoice.
We can say as part of the action it is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/259-5
00:50:17.478 --> 00:50:20.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>now assigned to whip.
So as part of the workflow you can.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/260-0
00:50:20.535 --> 00:50:24.466
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Say within this end to end workflow that
actually the WIP team are now.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/260-1
00:50:24.466 --> 00:50:29.052
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So in ServiceNow it will auto you know it
can be assigned and therefore you can and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/260-2
00:50:29.052 --> 00:50:33.311
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then they can pick it up seamlessly and
that's probably what ServiceNow we're</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/260-3
00:50:33.311 --> 00:50:37.679
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>getting at is that it can it can aids
that it's going back to WIP and then they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/260-4
00:50:37.679 --> 00:50:40.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>can pick it up.
You know it's been reversed.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/261-0
00:50:40.375 --> 00:50:44.505
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And you can say reasons why you can
capture those metrics on why it's been</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/261-1
00:50:44.505 --> 00:50:47.643
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>returned. I mean,
I don't know if it cancelled completes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/261-2
00:50:47.643 --> 00:50:50.781
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the invoice request because it's being
returned to whip,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/261-3
00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:55.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but that certainly could be a sub task
within there that it's now being assigned.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/262-0
00:50:55.895 --> 00:51:01.034
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And return to whip if that's helpful.
And then at that point it either closes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/262-1
00:51:01.034 --> 00:51:03.998
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it.
Presumably that portion of it or part of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/262-2
00:51:03.998 --> 00:51:08.016
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it then gets closed off your queue,
is that am I surprising,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/262-3
00:51:08.016 --> 00:51:13.220
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's how it would work? That is it.
The whole thing is then returned or part</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/262-4
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:13.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/264-0
00:51:14.175 --> 00:51:16.911
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah,
I mean it would just beeps and from that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/264-1
00:51:16.911 --> 00:51:21.624
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>category that's for the quest where they
are just the whole cancel it and return</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/264-2
00:51:21.624 --> 00:51:24.650
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>back to WEP,
which is just exactly what we would do</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/264-3
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:28.607
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and and then they make them,
they could come back on the exact same</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/264-4
00:51:28.607 --> 00:51:31.808
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ticket you know later that day and then
go, oh, right,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/264-5
00:51:31.808 --> 00:51:33.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>can you know issue this from.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/265-0
00:51:33.895 --> 00:51:37.908
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That or, you know. Yeah. So it won't.
It could be a request could come in a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/265-1
00:51:37.908 --> 00:51:40.970
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>week. Two weeks later.
It's from our point of view. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/265-2
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:43.345
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's it.
Closed with cancelled invoice and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/265-3
00:51:43.345 --> 00:51:46.301
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>returned the type.
So off your queue it will be closed.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/265-4
00:51:46.301 --> 00:51:50.155
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But overall workflow might still be open.
So you don't get a new ticket.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/265-5
00:51:50.155 --> 00:51:53.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You can sort of see the history if it
comes back every time.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/266-0
00:51:53.695 --> 00:51:57.614
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But it could be reassigned at this point,
which McMahon's on the call.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/266-1
00:51:57.614 --> 00:52:01.973
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Pick it up that it's now being handed
back to them and assigned to whip for to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/266-2
00:52:01.973 --> 00:52:04.457
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>pick up.
But for yourself it will be closed,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/266-3
00:52:04.457 --> 00:52:07.382
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>closed, complete.
You've done your activities on it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/266-4
00:52:07.382 --> 00:52:09.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We wouldn't assign it to the web team
because.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/267-0
00:52:10.935 --> 00:52:14.447
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, it's probably more just a,
it's changed. It's just the safety.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/267-1
00:52:14.447 --> 00:52:16.789
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's it. Yeah,
it's reversed on the system.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/267-2
00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:20.555
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's not something that's actually
physically moving between the the whip</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/267-3
00:52:20.555 --> 00:52:22.998
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>team.
It's just you're changing the status from</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/267-4
00:52:22.998 --> 00:52:25.951
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>whatever it is. Yeah,
from build back to it's now back to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/267-5
00:52:25.951 --> 00:52:28.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>working process. Yeah. So one build. OK.
Perfect.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/268-0
00:52:31.135 --> 00:52:31.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Thank you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/271-0
00:52:34.335 --> 00:52:36.940
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry,
just a quick question in regards to the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/269-0
00:52:34.695 --> 00:52:35.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Oh yes.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/271-1
00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.656
<v Marwan Altaie>the whip element and just more out of
curiosity,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/270-0
00:52:39.215 --> 00:52:39.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/271-2
00:52:39.656 --> 00:52:43.812
<v Marwan Altaie>I know we're going into it in more detail
on Monday, but as you just said,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/271-3
00:52:43.812 --> 00:52:46.473
<v Marwan Altaie>it would just be a kind of action and
reversal.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/271-4
00:52:46.473 --> 00:52:51.017
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that a case of we don't want the whip
processes and actions being completed in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/271-5
00:52:51.017 --> 00:52:53.455
<v Marwan Altaie>ServiceNow, if possible,
is it more like a?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/272-0
00:52:54.095 --> 00:52:58.004
<v Marwan Altaie>Tracked action. This is completed,
but all the other processes still remain</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/272-1
00:52:58.004 --> 00:52:59.135
<v Marwan Altaie>outside of ServiceNow.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/274-0
00:53:02.255 --> 00:53:06.220
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm not 100% sure, Barbara.
It's probably some money to answer on</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/274-1
00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:10.664
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Monday. My understanding, though,
is these status changes are made in VE.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/274-2
00:53:10.664 --> 00:53:15.049
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is that right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
So it's it's not something that we would</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/273-0
00:53:12.015 --> 00:53:12.175
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/274-3
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:18.893
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>do and ServiceNow anyway,
but that seeing that notwithstanding,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/274-4
00:53:18.893 --> 00:53:21.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't know what the wet processes are
of the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/275-0
00:53:21.895 --> 00:53:25.033
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Top of my head,
but we might need to have an alert to be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/275-1
00:53:25.033 --> 00:53:29.051
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>aware of it or something. You know?
I don't know, but we could probably.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/275-2
00:53:29.051 --> 00:53:33.509
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We could probably check that it could be
the when you when you've got your query</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/275-3
00:53:33.509 --> 00:53:36.812
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and you're saying that it's actually
going to be, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/275-4
00:53:36.812 --> 00:53:41.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>change the status in three, you know,
as you close the ticket in ServiceNow for</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/275-5
00:53:41.215 --> 00:53:41.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>example.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/276-0
00:53:42.095 --> 00:53:44.834
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That that could then trigger something
into the cup,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/276-1
00:53:44.834 --> 00:53:47.160
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we'll pick that up and then, yeah,
like,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/276-2
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.364
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>automate some of the report and we can do
it just now, right.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/276-3
00:53:50.364 --> 00:53:54.653
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But it might be something that helps them,
but we'll need to look at the if it was</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/276-4
00:53:54.653 --> 00:53:57.030
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>like control. No.
When we reverse an invoice,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/276-5
00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:01.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just that we just copy them in just and
that can do it for me. Yeah. I mean the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/277-0
00:54:01.455 --> 00:54:04.753
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That management team. But no,
I'm not sure how much helpful that would</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/277-1
00:54:04.753 --> 00:54:08.283
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>be for them because they would just be
getting lots of dozens and dozens of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/277-2
00:54:08.283 --> 00:54:10.885
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>alerts that might be absolutely
irrelevant and be more.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/277-3
00:54:10.885 --> 00:54:14.508
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But they're getting that state changed,
presumably anyway, are they in three?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/277-4
00:54:14.508 --> 00:54:17.945
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They'll be alerted when that happens.
If they're working on those actors.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/277-5
00:54:17.945 --> 00:54:21.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think what they do in checking the web,
they would then see there was.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/278-0
00:54:21.495 --> 00:54:21.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Back.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/279-0
00:54:22.055 --> 00:54:24.322
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But I'm I'm not sure if there's really
need to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/279-1
00:54:24.322 --> 00:54:28.194
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'll I'll capture as a parking lot item
for us to pick up and run down with them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/279-2
00:54:28.194 --> 00:54:30.744
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. I mean,
it's a good point about credit control,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/279-3
00:54:30.744 --> 00:54:33.057
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>though.
So if you currently copy them in just so</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/279-4
00:54:33.057 --> 00:54:35.749
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they've got awareness,
then that's something that we can</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/279-5
00:54:35.749 --> 00:54:39.243
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>automate. So as soon as you go,
I mean that would be good because that is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/279-6
00:54:39.243 --> 00:54:40.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>odd one. Yeah. You know, Mrs. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/280-0
00:54:42.255 --> 00:54:43.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK, that's good.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/281-0
00:54:45.895 --> 00:54:51.278
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then you've got these edit pro forma
few items here and how do they come to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/281-1
00:54:51.278 --> 00:54:54.306
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you?
Is that normally a request or you're by</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/281-2
00:54:54.306 --> 00:54:59.957
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the very fact that as we said from the P,
they're doing that pro forma and then you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/281-3
00:54:59.957 --> 00:55:00.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>go into?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/283-0
00:55:01.175 --> 00:55:03.943
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Billing.
Is it a subsequent task that you've found</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/283-1
00:55:03.943 --> 00:55:08.067
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as part of the check of going through
your invoices for billing that you're</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/283-2
00:55:08.067 --> 00:55:11.758
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>requesting them to edit it,
or are they asking you or the PS asking</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/283-3
00:55:11.758 --> 00:55:15.665
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you to edit these pro formas?
That would be the quest that come in from</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/283-4
00:55:15.665 --> 00:55:18.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the PS asking us to make those sort of
amends.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/284-0
00:55:19.335 --> 00:55:22.969
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>One of the ones I just noticed,
the one the third one down whip</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/284-1
00:55:22.969 --> 00:55:24.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>management activities that's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/285-0
00:55:26.255 --> 00:55:30.432
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That used to be a process before we had
the whip management team.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/285-1
00:55:30.432 --> 00:55:34.989
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We had someone in our team that was sort
of covering that a little bit,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/285-2
00:55:34.989 --> 00:55:38.849
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we still use that category simply for
what Mark Herbert,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/285-3
00:55:38.849 --> 00:55:42.899
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the CFOA lot of matters,
particularly the conments go under his</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/285-4
00:55:42.899 --> 00:55:43.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>name.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/286-0
00:55:43.935 --> 00:55:47.465
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So one of myself,
now another chap and the team does it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/286-1
00:55:47.465 --> 00:55:52.445
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>like each month we just run a report.
Nobody requests it on office matters and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/286-2
00:55:52.445 --> 00:55:57.487
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we go through just all the different
teams and fee earners to see how you look.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/286-3
00:55:57.487 --> 00:56:00.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Basically you're going to build this this
month.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/287-0
00:56:01.215 --> 00:56:05.458
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Just so we can give Mark an update.
So that goes under what management</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/287-1
00:56:05.458 --> 00:56:09.223
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>activities that process,
but we don't really that's a that's a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/287-2
00:56:09.223 --> 00:56:12.151
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>monthly routine maybe and do capture that
today.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/287-3
00:56:12.151 --> 00:56:17.111
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean it's it more like a calendar item
that you have in your that you're running</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/287-4
00:56:17.111 --> 00:56:20.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it. Yeah we just run it.
No one requests what what sensitive.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/288-0
00:56:21.535 --> 00:56:25.471
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We just run it and then have a look and
just check what's been billed,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/288-1
00:56:25.471 --> 00:56:28.964
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what's been cleared,
and then just the different how like sort</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/288-2
00:56:28.964 --> 00:56:31.902
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of matters,
whoever the fear and it is for each one,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/288-3
00:56:31.902 --> 00:56:35.727
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there'll be some of them are global.
Just it's just a general query.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/288-4
00:56:35.727 --> 00:56:38.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You're billing it this one for can it get
written off?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/289-0
00:56:39.175 --> 00:56:42.823
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If it looks quite aged and then we would
write it off for them,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/289-1
00:56:42.823 --> 00:56:47.611
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but generally it's it's more just and do
you capture the outcomes of that activity?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/289-2
00:56:47.611 --> 00:56:52.056
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Do you track it over time, you know,
so you could say this is what we've done</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/289-3
00:56:52.056 --> 00:56:56.388
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because people updated on a sort of it's
just almost sets up manual for the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/289-4
00:56:56.388 --> 00:56:58.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>reports spreadsheet and we just send it
to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/290-0
00:56:59.815 --> 00:57:02.429
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Mark,
just to let him know that's what matters</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/290-1
00:57:02.429 --> 00:57:06.266
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>are either cleared this month.
That's the ones that they're going to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/290-2
00:57:06.266 --> 00:57:09.769
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>clear before 1 fend,
and these are the ones that they've said.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/290-3
00:57:09.769 --> 00:57:14.106
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>No, we're not building it to, you know,
next month or next quarter, whatever.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/290-4
00:57:14.106 --> 00:57:16.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's really more than FYI,
just so when it was.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/291-0
00:57:17.415 --> 00:57:19.688
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK, somebody's looking at you. I think,
Sandeep,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/291-1
00:57:19.688 --> 00:57:23.490
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you mentioned this week of having there's
some tasks that calendar items that you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/291-2
00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:26.365
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>do, they're inferred.
But to capture what the team are up to,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/291-3
00:57:26.365 --> 00:57:29.843
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know, just because it sounds,
you know it might take you half an hour,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/291-4
00:57:29.843 --> 00:57:33.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it might take you half a day,
but certainly there could be a standard.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/292-0
00:57:34.175 --> 00:57:37.861
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Form or being in service now that's
capturing the fact that you've been</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/292-1
00:57:37.861 --> 00:57:41.957
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>working on it in your activities and you
could capture rather than having it in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/292-2
00:57:41.957 --> 00:57:45.899
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>another spreadsheet somewhere else,
ServiceNow could be an opportunity where</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/292-3
00:57:45.899 --> 00:57:49.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>even though it's scheduled as it's
scheduled activity and then?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/293-0
00:57:49.575 --> 00:57:52.663
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It has your effect.
You know when you started and how long</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/293-1
00:57:52.663 --> 00:57:56.744
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you took on it and it closed it and it
just goes into your metrics of all the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/293-2
00:57:56.744 --> 00:57:59.360
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>things.
So that shows that you're working at 150%</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/293-3
00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:02.918
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>every month on everything,
but it does factor into the fact that it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/293-4
00:58:02.918 --> 00:58:07.156
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>showcases everything a portfolio of all
those activities across billing and that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/293-5
00:58:07.156 --> 00:58:08.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>might be something if you can use.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/294-0
00:58:09.215 --> 00:58:13.439
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Assign it to yourself or another member
of the team will see it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/294-1
00:58:13.439 --> 00:58:18.378
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it captures all those outcomes and
over time you can track and get some</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/294-2
00:58:18.378 --> 00:58:22.082
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>metrics from those.
And also like like Rama yesterday we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/294-3
00:58:22.082 --> 00:58:27.346
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>discussed this team can also get on the
same e-mail right now or the same ticket</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/294-4
00:58:27.346 --> 00:58:28.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they can get multiple.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/295-0
00:58:29.015 --> 00:58:33.578
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Scenario requests to be done so right now
as we know share will will just pick up</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/295-1
00:58:33.578 --> 00:58:37.194
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just the first scenario,
but then if things are asked repeatedly</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/295-2
00:58:37.194 --> 00:58:40.477
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>different, yeah.
If you've got multiple activities it will</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/295-3
00:58:40.477 --> 00:58:43.147
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>be in one place rather than 1 ticket one
query.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/295-4
00:58:43.147 --> 00:58:47.654
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But that certainly could be a scheduled
form that you have and then the outcomes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/295-5
00:58:47.654 --> 00:58:48.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>could be you know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/296-0
00:58:49.055 --> 00:58:51.836
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know this outcome,
that outcome and your actions can be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/296-1
00:58:51.836 --> 00:58:55.266
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>tracked and off the back of that,
maybe it can trigger some other things,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/296-2
00:58:55.266 --> 00:58:59.113
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but at least the capacity spent on it and
the metrics from that can be captured in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/296-3
00:58:59.113 --> 00:59:01.430
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>service.
Now can I show what would you call that?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/296-4
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:04.952
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Because it sounds like that's probably
not the right name for that service.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/296-5
00:59:04.952 --> 00:59:08.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's something like matter billing
reported like monthly matter billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/297-0
00:59:08.535 --> 00:59:13.539
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The whole thing is that kind of, yeah,
I mean, we just use that category. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/297-1
00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:16.978
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because it's it's something purely
secondment related.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/297-2
00:59:16.978 --> 00:59:20.543
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's not all it's it's not a separate
forms of comments,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/297-3
00:59:20.543 --> 00:59:24.483
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>a lot of secondments are listed on it,
but there's some other,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/297-4
00:59:24.483 --> 00:59:27.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's just something that matters that
under marked.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/298-0
00:59:28.255 --> 00:59:32.200
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We have secondment as a assigned task.
In this list we do have a secondment</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/298-1
00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:34.692
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>category,
but we tend to keep that safe because</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/298-2
00:59:34.692 --> 00:59:37.806
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's right, OK, it's a different.
It's different from that,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/298-3
00:59:37.806 --> 00:59:40.817
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but you could have,
I mean again where it comes in serves</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/298-4
00:59:40.817 --> 00:59:43.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that if you had the common category and
you selected it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/299-0
00:59:44.335 --> 00:59:48.024
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You could have fields or data just
associated to that that you capture,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/299-1
00:59:48.024 --> 00:59:51.252
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and if there's another category it would
display other things,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/299-2
00:59:51.252 --> 00:59:55.197
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so that's possible within the same within
the same form or the same service.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/299-3
00:59:55.197 --> 00:59:57.913
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And if we could, sorry, no, no,
no on you go. Sorry,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/299-4
00:59:57.913 --> 01:00:00.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't mean to say that. Well,
sure we're talking to you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/300-0
01:00:02.575 --> 01:00:05.115
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The microphones pick up the slight,
you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/300-1
01:00:05.115 --> 01:00:07.765
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>in any checklist that you have today,
you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/300-2
01:00:07.765 --> 01:00:12.457
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to formalise that we can incorporate that
into the form and they could be, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/300-3
01:00:12.457 --> 01:00:16.598
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm not going to solutionize now,
but there could be subsequent tasks that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/300-4
01:00:16.598 --> 01:00:18.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>can be triggered off the back of that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/301-0
01:00:19.535 --> 01:00:23.038
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, I was just going to ask.
So we had the ask people workshops last</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/301-1
01:00:23.038 --> 01:00:27.083
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>week and the secondment schedule was one
thing that came up to discuss in today's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/301-2
01:00:27.083 --> 01:00:29.451
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>workshop.
So we can look to discuss it later on</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/301-3
01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:32.362
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>like as we go through these processes.
But I think it's a,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/301-4
01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:35.470
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we know it's a pain point.
We know we tried to make it better,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/301-5
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:38.381
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we couldn't.
So it will be good to have the discussion</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/301-6
01:00:38.381 --> 01:00:38.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>in this.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/302-0
01:00:39.295 --> 01:00:43.856
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It will be slightly better because we
just discussed yesterday we're gonna</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/302-1
01:00:43.856 --> 01:00:47.991
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>control the whole process. OK? We will.
Yeah. So, I mean right now,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/302-2
01:00:47.991 --> 01:00:51.457
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean when I say we like, yes,
the billing, secondment,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/302-3
01:00:51.457 --> 01:00:56.626
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing is also done by some of the PS in
London, but they will not do that anymore.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/302-4
01:00:56.626 --> 01:00:58.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So the billing will be done only in.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/303-0
01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:02.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>To Glasgow and so that will help us to
coordinate better with ask people and all.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/303-1
01:01:02.855 --> 01:01:04.953
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.
So you still need to get it from ask</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/303-2
01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:07.392
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>people to ask.
People still need to send you this</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/303-3
01:01:07.392 --> 01:01:09.635
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>comment schedule. Cool. Yeah.
I think we can.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/303-4
01:01:09.635 --> 01:01:13.147
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We can discuss that later on.
It may well be something that we actually</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/303-5
01:01:13.147 --> 01:01:14.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>maybe need to have like a.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/305-0
01:01:15.375 --> 01:01:19.091
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>To recall or something with people
yourselves ageing online,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/305-1
01:01:19.091 --> 01:01:20.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>be involved as well, Nikki.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/306-0
01:01:22.495 --> 01:01:25.701
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK, because that's why I asked.
If we have a secondment as a category</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/306-1
01:01:25.701 --> 01:01:28.449
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because we will,
we might have to revisit those supporters,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/306-2
01:01:28.449 --> 01:01:31.517
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we are not there yet.
I think I haven't even told you but kind</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/306-3
01:01:31.517 --> 01:01:35.272
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of approved. Now, tell me now. Yeah. No,
because I know I remember in the past we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/306-4
01:01:35.272 --> 01:01:37.882
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>tried to make the report come
automatically from fusion,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/306-5
01:01:37.882 --> 01:01:41.500
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it wasn't giving us what it needed.
It was like through records and stuff.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/306-6
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It was messy.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/307-0
01:01:43.015 --> 01:01:46.994
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK, cool. No worries. Thank you.
I've popped that and we can pick that up</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/307-1
01:01:46.994 --> 01:01:49.521
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as well.
Just just a quick question for me and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/307-2
01:01:49.521 --> 01:01:53.554
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's probably more for the room,
a consistent theme this week has been the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/307-3
01:01:53.554 --> 01:01:56.995
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>P ES and their custom in practise and
behaviour. I think we'll.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/307-4
01:01:56.995 --> 01:01:59.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean it's not that programme job to fix
that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/308-0
01:02:00.535 --> 01:02:02.987
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>However,
I think we should be flagging where we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/308-1
01:02:02.987 --> 01:02:06.460
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>have get processes that's constrained by
that custom and behaviour,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/308-2
01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.218
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and that can then flush up and again it
goes back to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/308-3
01:02:09.218 --> 01:02:12.589
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If you get it up to the right audience,
they can make a decision.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/308-4
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:16.777
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is it worth tightening effects or is it
something we deal with in a different way</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/308-5
01:02:16.777 --> 01:02:18.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and accept the constraints and risk?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/309-0
01:02:19.015 --> 01:02:21.960
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, no, absolutely.
And I speak to them every day.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/309-1
01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:26.514
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I spoke to the head of a OPS London OPS
last night after and I gave her a view of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/309-2
01:02:26.514 --> 01:02:29.903
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what we are doing in service now.
So they are aware as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/309-3
01:02:29.903 --> 01:02:33.236
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And to be honest,
they might have certain frustrations with</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/309-4
01:02:33.236 --> 01:02:34.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>with our processes as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/310-0
01:02:35.575 --> 01:02:39.311
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I completely agree that we're not
going to be changing that right now.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/310-1
01:02:39.311 --> 01:02:42.744
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We're not going to resolve that.
I think we should make suggestion,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/310-2
01:02:42.744 --> 01:02:45.924
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we should just highlight you're you're
you're investing thing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/310-3
01:02:45.924 --> 01:02:49.963
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We should take an action the OCM team to
find out who's actually head of the PE</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/310-4
01:02:49.963 --> 01:02:50.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>team.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/311-0
01:02:50.615 --> 01:02:55.749
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And and the biggest, biggest kind of,
you know, like the what do you call it?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/311-1
01:02:55.749 --> 01:03:00.423
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The biggest factor will be the knowledge
piece. So the training piece,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/311-2
01:03:00.423 --> 01:03:04.767
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so we have an agenda to work on the
billing side of the training.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/311-3
01:03:04.767 --> 01:03:09.835
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You will speak with Chris on Monday.
They have also some training things for</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/311-4
01:03:09.835 --> 01:03:10.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>credit.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/312-0
01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:13.564
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Control WIP as well.
So I think how we are packaging that up</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/312-1
01:03:13.564 --> 01:03:17.433
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>will answer your question or resolve your
question. I think it's broader.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/312-2
01:03:17.433 --> 01:03:21.719
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think Alex's point is that it's broader
than just billing like we've noticed in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/312-3
01:03:21.719 --> 01:03:25.849
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ask. We've noticed in people. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, we've so so that so for sorry.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/312-4
01:03:25.849 --> 01:03:30.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So that training thing is not just about
billing. That's what I'm saying it will.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/313-0
01:03:30.215 --> 01:03:35.026
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Will be entire finance piece, you know,
with them. OK, we'll we'll take. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/313-1
01:03:35.026 --> 01:03:37.827
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then acute. You know,
we use service now.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/313-2
01:03:37.827 --> 01:03:42.819
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You can have the metrics on the back of
that and and we're a you're a legal firm.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/313-3
01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:46.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There is the service to that.
So the thing about this is it's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/314-0
01:03:47.095 --> 01:03:50.225
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>In service,
now you're finding root cause that you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/314-1
01:03:50.225 --> 01:03:53.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>get some metrics.
There might be you know AP that's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/314-2
01:03:53.415 --> 01:03:58.446
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>particularly you know they raise the most
queries throughout there and maybe it's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/314-3
01:03:58.446 --> 01:04:02.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that they need more training.
You know it's it's to aid this one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/315-0
01:04:03.255 --> 01:04:05.836
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>One workflow,
so you'll you'll use ServiceNow to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/315-1
01:04:05.836 --> 01:04:08.680
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>discover or answer questions or metrics
that you can.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/315-2
01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:12.788
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You've now got the supporting evidence.
There's a frequent partner in this PE</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/315-3
01:04:12.788 --> 01:04:15.158
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that raise everything.
They push everything,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/315-4
01:04:15.158 --> 01:04:19.529
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they throw it over the Fed. That's fine.
And that's a that can be taken into their</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/315-5
01:04:19.529 --> 01:04:22.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>professional development and they're
incentivized.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/316-0
01:04:22.295 --> 01:04:25.160
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Bonuses, whatever.
Not for the partners but the fees.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/316-1
01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:29.404
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But this is capturing getting the right
calls that if this is coming in regular</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/316-2
01:04:29.404 --> 01:04:32.800
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you can say this metric.
This is the reason why this is the you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/316-3
01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:37.203
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>know and that's all collated and you get
a very nice dashboard and the reasons why</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/316-4
01:04:37.203 --> 01:04:39.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and actually for yourself you're tracking
it and.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/317-0
01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:43.374
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We're getting the numbers of these
because of and.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/317-1
01:04:43.374 --> 01:04:47.009
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Those things can then be fixed upstream,
so it's a constant,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/317-2
01:04:47.009 --> 01:04:50.406
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know reducing the reactive behaviour
into proactive,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/317-3
01:04:50.406 --> 01:04:54.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and then you'll have the supporting
evidence to do that. That's the name.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/318-0
01:04:55.175 --> 01:04:58.101
<v Mark Sedge>And and this just sorry Deborah,
to add to that,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/318-1
01:04:58.101 --> 01:05:02.340
<v Mark Sedge>remember also that we have the ability to
present knowledge, articles,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/318-2

<v Mark Sedge>knowledge collateral,
DO two to the audience via the employee</v>

<v Mark Sedge>centre.
So you know once if we if we see that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/318-4
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:11.535
<v Mark Sedge>there's common areas where you want to
guide.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/320-0
01:05:12.335 --> 01:05:12.455
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/321-0
01:05:12.535 --> 01:05:15.106
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
these are sorts of things you can put</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/321-1
01:05:15.106 --> 01:05:19.838
<v Mark Sedge>forwards and you know that they audience
can search for pick up on understand or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/321-2
01:05:19.838 --> 01:05:24.160
<v Mark Sedge>even you could reference say at the
beginning of a request item when they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/321-3
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.490
<v Mark Sedge>click a request.
You might say if you want help you know</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/321-4
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:31.988
<v Mark Sedge>you know refer to this article to give
you the information required for this</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/321-5
01:05:31.988 --> 01:05:32.455
<v Mark Sedge>request.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/322-0
01:05:32.535 --> 01:05:35.235
<v Mark Sedge>Whatever you know,
you've the the the the tool will provide</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/322-1
01:05:35.235 --> 01:05:36.495
<v Mark Sedge>you that ability to do that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/323-0
01:05:37.935 --> 01:05:42.126
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, exactly. I mean for me,
I'm taking this as a tool and I'm taking</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/323-1
01:05:42.126 --> 01:05:46.257
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>this as like metric, you know,
tangible information that where is the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/323-2
01:05:46.257 --> 01:05:49.031
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>gap.
I'm not expecting ServiceNow of of course</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/323-3
01:05:49.031 --> 01:05:53.339
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to fix my operational process gap with
any of the teams. But what it is,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/323-4
01:05:53.339 --> 01:05:55.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what it is helping me with is it is
giving.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/324-0
01:05:56.135 --> 01:05:59.706
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Ammunition to say, hey,
now let's work on the knowledge piece</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/324-1
01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:03.738
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because this is coming and this will tie
the dots properly, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/324-2
01:06:03.738 --> 01:06:08.173
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so I'm using this as a different in a
different way ammunition or supporting</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/324-3
01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:11.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>tools for the ammunition,
sounds like a firing line but.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/325-0
01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:15.154
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. And look,
the intention is you're still going to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/325-1
01:06:15.154 --> 01:06:18.573
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>have a workload,
but the ability to reduce the time to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/325-2
01:06:18.573 --> 01:06:23.608
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>complete those queries you know becomes,
you know, for billing and reputational.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/325-3
01:06:23.608 --> 01:06:27.151
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You're turning things around quicker,
smoother, correct.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/325-4
01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:29.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And you know the whole aim of.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/326-0
01:06:29.415 --> 01:06:33.599
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ServiceNow, as the mantra is right,
first time you know you can go through it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/326-1
01:06:33.599 --> 01:06:37.253
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There's not this back and forth,
so if we can capture as much of the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/326-2
01:06:37.253 --> 01:06:41.171
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>request upfront right first time,
you can then go through your happy path</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/326-3
01:06:41.171 --> 01:06:44.084
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of a process and then maybe not first
time every time,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/326-4
01:06:44.084 --> 01:06:48.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but you get the metrics to then correct
it. And it's just this continuous.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/327-0
01:06:49.015 --> 01:06:52.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Loop that they you move towards a very
proactive happy path.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/327-1
01:06:52.335 --> 01:06:55.491
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's the intention. Sorry.
Just to go back to this one,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/327-2
01:06:55.491 --> 01:06:58.811
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it sounds like this is not one that you
are using currently.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/327-3
01:06:58.811 --> 01:07:03.164
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's kind of a different service or is
that incorrect in that's the monthly one</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/327-4
01:07:03.164 --> 01:07:07.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>where and then you capture the metrics on
that for based on the monthly meeting so?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/328-0
01:07:07.935 --> 01:07:12.096
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's a thing, it's an activity you do,
but we might want to rename it. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/328-1
01:07:12.096 --> 01:07:14.311
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah,
it's still on the capacity of your</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/328-2
01:07:14.311 --> 01:07:17.715
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>monthly active people.
Just use that when they try and keep it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/328-3
01:07:17.715 --> 01:07:21.118
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>safe. Yeah. Look, by all means,
this is the this is the as is.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/328-4
01:07:21.118 --> 01:07:23.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's not where we'll land,
but it's a good.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/329-0
01:07:23.815 --> 01:07:27.353
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Discussion point that we can flush out
and to roll them up,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/329-1
01:07:27.353 --> 01:07:32.070
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it I think I mean they've been well
presented to us as sort of scenarios of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/329-2
01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:36.728
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>purging, cancelling, reversing split.
I know that we haven't come to split yet</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/329-3
01:07:36.728 --> 01:07:40.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and all the complex billing but OK that's
good. How did my ignorance?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/330-0
01:07:41.215 --> 01:07:43.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Mark. Mark who?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/331-0
01:07:46.775 --> 01:07:51.191
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>For the for the report.
So the report I'm here but in the CFO. OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/331-1
01:07:51.191 --> 01:07:52.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Thank you. Thank you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/332-0
01:07:54.255 --> 01:07:56.963
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK,
you know you can share that outcome with</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/332-1
01:07:56.963 --> 01:08:00.513
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>them or whether it's a,
you know maybe at the end of that,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/332-2
01:08:00.513 --> 01:08:04.485
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't know if you have to produce any
supporting documentation,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/332-3
01:08:04.485 --> 01:08:08.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but that could certainly be the backbone
of that as well, yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/333-0
01:08:10.695 --> 01:08:16.179
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK, I think that's another one.
There's the transferring time as part of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/333-1
01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:20.160
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>a billing request that's probably is that
adjusting.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/333-2
01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:25.794
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So when you get the invoice prepaid,
is that an activity on the back of it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/333-3
01:08:25.794 --> 01:08:26.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that you're?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/334-0
01:08:27.655 --> 01:08:31.203
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Just another activity of with that's
meant it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/334-1
01:08:31.203 --> 01:08:36.938
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's when the time zone a pro forma if
the time if a pro forma has not been</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/334-2
01:08:36.938 --> 01:08:40.486
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>generated on a matter this P ES and hub
teams,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/334-3
01:08:40.486 --> 01:08:43.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they can action time transfers themselves.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/335-0
01:08:44.375 --> 01:08:49.521
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But if it's the voted generated,
a pro forma only really billing can</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/335-1
01:08:49.521 --> 01:08:52.877
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>action the transfer,
so that's for as I say,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/335-2
01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:57.799
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>if the time zone a pro forma it's time
that we transfer for them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/335-3
01:08:57.799 --> 01:08:59.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's not always.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/336-0
01:08:59.895 --> 01:09:02.479
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's not part of a billing request as
such,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/336-1
01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:07.176
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's a query they're asking you to assist
them in transferring that time. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/336-2
01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:11.521
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. It's part of the pre billing.
A bit like where the as I say though,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/336-3
01:09:11.521 --> 01:09:15.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>go create off that entry or can you amend
the value of that entry,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/336-4
01:09:15.455 --> 01:09:19.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>change that whip to query for me?
So that could be part of a.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/337-0
01:09:19.935 --> 01:09:23.669
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>On the new part of the overall quick a
potential query,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/337-1
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:27.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it sounds like we I wouldn't call a
query as such,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/337-2
01:09:27.335 --> 01:09:32.202
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's just it's just a request,
so it wouldn't be like if they'd actually</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/337-3
01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:35.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>seen in the invoice requests and included
transfers.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/338-0
01:09:36.055 --> 01:09:40.444
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yes, that would just be class.
We would just class that as adequate for</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/338-1
01:09:40.444 --> 01:09:43.187
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>an invoice,
but that's where they've already</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/338-2
01:09:43.187 --> 01:09:46.783
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>generated a pro forma,
but they want some time transferred</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/338-3
01:09:46.783 --> 01:09:50.379
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>either from or to it.
It's more about merging time, right,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/338-4
01:09:50.379 --> 01:09:55.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>managing the time cards that you are
potentially going to bill against is that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/339-0
01:09:55.615 --> 01:09:58.980
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, certainly. What just is that,
is that related to time cards rather than</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/339-1
01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:02.042
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the actual? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's just that being managing time cards</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/339-2
01:10:02.042 --> 01:10:04.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>rather than OK, if you put managed, yeah.
Managed time cards. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/340-0
01:10:07.415 --> 01:10:11.209
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK. And the same purging time, yeah,
I mean that would, yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/340-1
01:10:11.209 --> 01:10:14.574
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just that's just a general request that
would come in.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/340-2
01:10:14.574 --> 01:10:19.591
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It might be in a pro format, might not,
but it wouldn't be as part of the invoice</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/340-3
01:10:19.591 --> 01:10:24.608
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>request on some again they might send an
invoice request going to build this at X</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/340-4
01:10:24.608 --> 01:10:26.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>amount and it includes.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/341-0
01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:29.236
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Write offs,
but that would be just where the the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/341-1
01:10:29.236 --> 01:10:34.168
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>thing and what can you either write or
full time in this matter or on a pro</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/341-2
01:10:34.168 --> 01:10:37.153
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>forma?
Can you write off specific time cards,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/341-3
01:10:37.153 --> 01:10:41.826
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but they're not actually asking us for an
invoice at that time? OK? No.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/341-4
01:10:41.826 --> 01:10:45.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So no invoice on the back of it and it's
just an activity.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/342-0
01:10:45.735 --> 01:10:50.040
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Probably part of their sort of pre
billing. Yeah. OK pre billing activity,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/342-1
01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.681
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK.
And they and actually sorry to interrupt,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/342-2
01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:57.272
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but just on that like although it can be
pre billing sometimes after billing as</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/342-3
01:10:57.272 --> 01:11:01.979
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>well like if there's maybe been time kind
of leftover on the files then sometimes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/342-4
01:11:01.979 --> 01:11:02.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they can.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/343-0
01:11:03.015 --> 01:11:05.588
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Patch it at that point and just want it
written off,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/343-1
01:11:05.588 --> 01:11:08.938
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so actually it can be pre billing or
sometimes post billing as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/343-2
01:11:08.938 --> 01:11:12.578
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Just depends on or or during your invoice
process or Julian. Yeah, OK, OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/343-3
01:11:12.578 --> 01:11:15.588
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's what can cover.
And when you say they and then we talk</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/343-4
01:11:15.588 --> 01:11:19.569
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>about they are we talking about PES the
request or I guess but the request but it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/343-5
01:11:19.569 --> 01:11:22.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>tends to be the PE generally yeah.
But we will get some.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/345-0
01:11:22.415 --> 01:11:25.147
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>From fee earners,
but it's usually more often than not it's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/345-1
01:11:25.147 --> 01:11:27.559
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the PE. OK, all right, but we can open it.
You know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/345-2
01:11:27.559 --> 01:11:30.199
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it doesn't have to be locked down,
particularly to the P,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/345-3
01:11:30.199 --> 01:11:33.476
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>or can you get it from the partner direct?
So it tends not to be. It's,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/345-4
01:11:33.476 --> 01:11:37.118
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I was thinking even a show sheet, right,
could potentially. Yeah. Anyone. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/345-5
01:11:37.118 --> 01:11:39.940
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Occasionally. Partners do as well. Yeah.
Here's the PS. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/345-6
01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:42.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They don't want to lock it down.
And then no one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/346-0
01:11:43.095 --> 01:11:45.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's generally, yeah.
And then it comes into you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/346-1
01:11:45.975 --> 01:11:49.662
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So the information they have to provide
you with is the client.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/346-2
01:11:49.662 --> 01:11:52.196
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm just thinking about the things
popular,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/346-3
01:11:52.196 --> 01:11:56.574
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the information you would need from them,
the client, the matter, the time,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/346-4
01:11:56.574 --> 01:11:59.396
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>etcetera,
that could be all pre populated rather</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/346-5
01:11:59.396 --> 01:12:01.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>than having this back and forth with them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/347-0
01:12:03.055 --> 01:12:05.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Anything else that you need, I mean?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/348-0
01:12:06.615 --> 01:12:10.635
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>From a for those sort of ones, yeah.
I mean, occasionally we need,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/348-1
01:12:10.635 --> 01:12:12.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we need to go back like though.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/349-0
01:12:13.895 --> 01:12:17.793
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>An effective start that it means you need
to know when it applied to or is it now.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/349-1
01:12:17.793 --> 01:12:21.691
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is it when it needs to be done it just I
mean the question and we would just do it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/349-2
01:12:21.691 --> 01:12:24.274
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and we're sort of general sort of time
scale but yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/349-3
01:12:24.274 --> 01:12:28.172
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as long as that it's clear they just need
to be clear on what they want. OK. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/349-4
01:12:28.172 --> 01:12:32.022
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean occasionally you you I can't think
of an example of the top ahead but they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/349-5
01:12:32.022 --> 01:12:33.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>can you kind of vague.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/350-0
01:12:33.415 --> 01:12:37.631
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Instructions on these ones and you have
to go back and say like, sorry,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/350-1
01:12:37.631 --> 01:12:41.612
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what time of what period or but now just
to get them to clarify it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/350-2
01:12:41.612 --> 01:12:45.242
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But you know usually they're quite,
you know fairly specific,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/350-3
01:12:45.242 --> 01:12:49.398
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it's not because the queries are no
longer e-mail, they're filled.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/350-4
01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:52.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know you're asking them questions
leading questions.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/351-0
01:12:53.015 --> 01:12:55.770
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it lands with you again first time.
So as you said,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/351-1
01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:58.273
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it could be what's the client?
What's the matter?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/351-2
01:12:58.273 --> 01:13:01.779
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Give the numbers the time card so they
can complete all that for you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/351-3
01:13:01.779 --> 01:13:05.284
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's a very simple process.
So it's just those types of checklists</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/351-4
01:13:05.284 --> 01:13:09.340
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that you might want in place when you're
capturing these these queries coming in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/351-5
01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:12.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>rather than them structures in an e-mail
that you can't, you know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/352-0
01:13:12.895 --> 01:13:16.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Structures like an e-mail where it's a
free text box,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/352-1
01:13:16.015 --> 01:13:20.291
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you're just asking them leading questions
and then it lands with you as a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/352-2
01:13:20.291 --> 01:13:23.527
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>straightforward, you know,
easy to process. Yeah, yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/352-3
01:13:23.527 --> 01:13:28.149
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So maybe we'll think about, you know,
I've put some data fields associated with</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/352-4
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:30.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that and we can draught that out.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/353-0
01:13:30.815 --> 01:13:34.167
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then when you receive it,
use a whole group.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/353-1
01:13:34.167 --> 01:13:39.640
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Does it go to anybody particularly or you
just pick them up as a whole billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/353-2
01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.086
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There's no priority on them,
or if it's for a particular client,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/353-3
01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:49.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there's no thresholds that this is avip
or this needs to be. I mean, they're all.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/354-0
01:13:50.215 --> 01:13:56.836
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Urgent. Yeah, they might. I mean,
they might mark urgent and we would sort</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/354-1
01:13:56.836 --> 01:14:00.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of check why towards one friend we would.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/355-0
01:14:02.255 --> 01:14:05.925
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Everything's a priority,
but we would probably try and prioritise</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/355-1
01:14:05.925 --> 01:14:10.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>them a bit because we generally know
they're asking them for them to swear</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/355-2
01:14:10.095 --> 01:14:13.487
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they're sorting out the pre building to
get the invoice out,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/355-3
01:14:13.487 --> 01:14:18.213
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so the quicker we get them done for them,
the quicker they can finalise the invoice.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/355-4
01:14:18.213 --> 01:14:21.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But the the and you can pick them up we
generally FC.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/356-0
01:14:21.255 --> 01:14:24.965
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We've maybe got a new person the team,
before they get fully into.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/356-1
01:14:24.965 --> 01:14:28.619
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's a sort of a request.
We'll assign to them just to get them</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/356-2
01:14:28.619 --> 01:14:33.048
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>used to the system and the sort of call
them sort of quick wins because they're</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/356-3
01:14:33.048 --> 01:14:37.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>generally you can get them cleared pretty
quickly. It can be auto assigned.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/357-0
01:14:37.575 --> 01:14:40.996
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Based on the skill metrics that if it's
that type of query,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/357-1
01:14:40.996 --> 01:14:44.759
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's categorised that it goes to them.
You know if we reassigned,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/357-2
01:14:44.759 --> 01:14:48.293
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't want them to think that they get
it all in their pot,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/357-3
01:14:48.293 --> 01:14:52.227
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but initially as part of that process for
allocating as you're busy,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/357-4
01:14:52.227 --> 01:14:56.787
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it could be that it sits in their queue
and they can reassign or and you get to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/357-5
01:14:56.787 --> 01:14:57.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>see.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/358-0
01:14:57.215 --> 01:14:59.992
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Everything in you get to see everybody's
work.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/358-1
01:14:59.992 --> 01:15:04.483
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It could be in the morning that you
shuffle around and anybody can reassign</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/358-2
01:15:04.483 --> 01:15:07.674
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to anybody.
So you could have the tasks of the day on</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/358-3
01:15:07.674 --> 01:15:10.510
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>a dashboard,
but you know yourself is you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/358-4
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:14.586
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>anybody within or the manager,
the department can then just reassign</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/358-5
01:15:14.586 --> 01:15:15.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>accordingly.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/359-0
01:15:15.615 --> 01:15:18.574
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We go away. Sorry.
Can I just check in terms of when you get</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/359-1
01:15:18.574 --> 01:15:21.532
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>those requests coming in,
do the requesters potentially have</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/359-2
01:15:21.532 --> 01:15:24.394
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>multiple time card movements that they
might say actually,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/359-3
01:15:24.394 --> 01:15:28.080
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's for this matter of what this one and
also for this matter of this one,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/359-4
01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>rather than having individual requests
that coming through so.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/360-0
01:15:32.255 --> 01:15:35.035
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So managing that,
you'd need to kind of like decipher for</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/360-1
01:15:35.035 --> 01:15:38.389
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK, right. This is this matter.
I need to move this from this time to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/360-2
01:15:38.389 --> 01:15:41.790
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>this to the matter etcetera.
Is that how it's coming in at the moment?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/360-3
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:44.474
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, they come in in all different ways.
To be honest.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/360-4
01:15:44.474 --> 01:15:48.498
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean someone's will be matter by matter
I mean quite often it's quite simple even</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/360-5
01:15:48.498 --> 01:15:50.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>if it is a transfer they might say.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/361-0
01:15:50.695 --> 01:15:55.966
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>All time on matter number blah blah to go
to matter eggs and you might have various</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/361-1
01:15:55.966 --> 01:16:01.047
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>requests that other times it can only be
specific entries in each of the matters</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/361-2
01:16:01.047 --> 01:16:05.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they want moved and the same with the
write offs but they can also send it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/362-0
01:16:06.335 --> 01:16:11.419
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We can just send it in the e-mail with
how as you see everything all just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/362-1
01:16:11.419 --> 01:16:16.021
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>written in text, that one,
they may attach APDF of a billing guide</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/362-2
01:16:16.021 --> 01:16:20.074
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>with a marked up.
Sometimes they generate an Excel report.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/362-3
01:16:20.074 --> 01:16:25.226
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Again all depends really on what the
particular Fiona wants to look at and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/362-4
01:16:25.226 --> 01:16:25.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they've.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/363-0
01:16:25.935 --> 01:16:30.930
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They'll get their own preferences,
and that's where it comes in. I mean,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/363-1
01:16:30.930 --> 01:16:36.062
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>sometimes we just got a list which
infuriates me personally when it's what</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/363-2
01:16:36.062 --> 01:16:41.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they all and all as is what the time
index numbers and you can get like 40 and.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/364-0
01:16:41.855 --> 01:16:44.781
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It might.
They'll tell you what mattered at someone,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/364-1
01:16:44.781 --> 01:16:47.817
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but there could be, you know, 500 entries,
not matter,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/364-2
01:16:47.817 --> 01:16:50.522
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and you're trying to look for each index
number,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/364-3
01:16:50.522 --> 01:16:54.663
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and that's only information you get.
But there's there's so many different</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/364-4
01:16:54.663 --> 01:16:56.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ways they they can ask for it and that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/365-0
01:16:57.535 --> 01:17:02.299
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>While you know that it's not going to be
emailed, it's a query we can force that,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/365-1
01:17:02.299 --> 01:17:05.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as you said, they can add new,
add new as one request,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/365-2
01:17:05.495 --> 01:17:10.200
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so it comes in as multiple tasks so that
you know once you complete one you know</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/365-3
01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.873
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it.
What I'm saying is the request itself can</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/365-4
01:17:12.873 --> 01:17:15.952
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>remain open,
but each of the tasks in themselves can</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/365-5
01:17:15.952 --> 01:17:17.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>be closed complete.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/368-0
01:17:17.495 --> 01:17:21.431
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But we can certainly give those leading
questions upfront. The forces them,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/368-1
01:17:21.431 --> 01:17:23.865
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know, behaviour rather than his,
you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/366-0
01:17:23.615 --> 01:17:23.735
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/368-2
01:17:23.865 --> 01:17:27.748
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>an attachment and just go and do it.
So they'll have to mandatory complete</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/368-3
01:17:27.748 --> 01:17:31.787
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>some of the data before it lands with you.
So they're doing some of the heavy</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/367-0
01:17:30.695 --> 01:17:30.855
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/368-4
01:17:31.787 --> 01:17:32.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>lifting upfront.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/369-0
01:17:33.295 --> 01:17:33.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/371-0
01:17:33.455 --> 01:17:36.616
<v Mark Sedge>And what we can,
what we can also do at the opening of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/371-1
01:17:36.616 --> 01:17:39.432
<v Mark Sedge>that is do some positioning text that
says this.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/371-2
01:17:39.432 --> 01:17:44.086
<v Mark Sedge>You know you will be asked you know to
provide each one you know to enable us to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/371-3
01:17:44.086 --> 01:17:47.649
<v Mark Sedge>help you more effectively.
This is why you get the breakdown.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/371-4
01:17:47.649 --> 01:17:50.407
<v Mark Sedge>So then when they're presented with AD
next ad,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/371-5
01:17:50.407 --> 01:17:52.935
<v Mark Sedge>next ad next sort of thing they
understand.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/372-0
01:17:53.055 --> 01:17:55.635
<v Mark Sedge>Why?
Because we've already said it in an</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/372-1
01:17:55.635 --> 01:18:00.415
<v Mark Sedge>opening so positional, you know,
guide note kind of thing that makes sense.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/373-0
01:18:00.975 --> 01:18:03.266
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I'm sure that's for them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/373-1
01:18:03.266 --> 01:18:06.797
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It was quite key. I can you just do it.
You know, I think there might be,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/373-2
01:18:06.797 --> 01:18:09.040
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but if we can make it easier for them as
well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/373-3
01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.571
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they they're also a customer at this
point where they were filling in the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/373-4
01:18:12.571 --> 01:18:14.910
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>request.
If we can make that experience good for</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/373-5
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:17.200
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>them,
they'll be more willing to do it in order</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/373-6
01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:20.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that it's a good experience for you.
So it's getting that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/374-0
01:18:20.215 --> 01:18:23.449
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Line balance,
as you say that they don't end up just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/374-1
01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:27.720
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>doing attach. See attachment 500.
You know it's it's giving them that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/374-2
01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:30.954
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>leading stuff that aids them to do it
easy you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/374-3
01:18:30.954 --> 01:18:34.126
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because maybe they've got not the
capacity as well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/374-4
01:18:34.126 --> 01:18:39.129
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but certainly we'll look at formalising
what you need is mandatory information in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/374-5
01:18:39.129 --> 01:18:39.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>order.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/375-0
01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:43.726
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>To process those requests. Oh, sorry.
That's all right. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/375-1
01:18:43.726 --> 01:18:48.835
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you can finish off when you were saying,
like, how the auto assign, which. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/375-2
01:18:48.835 --> 01:18:51.674
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>sure.
But you were saying you could view so,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/375-3
01:18:51.674 --> 01:18:56.657
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>like, just say there's a view of like,
whole all requests that come in and see</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/375-4
01:18:56.657 --> 01:18:59.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>them all and they'll just see where
there's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/376-0
01:18:59.535 --> 01:19:03.394
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So setting because I would be concerned
because especially that one things</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/376-1
01:19:03.394 --> 01:19:07.510
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>although I'm saying we'll be generally
sort of try to assign them to you know I</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/376-2
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:11.677
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>mean MD can pick them up but when we've
got a new start but I wouldn't want them</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/376-3
01:19:11.677 --> 01:19:15.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because it can be loads of them all just
going to that one person because.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/377-0
01:19:16.015 --> 01:19:19.379
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They how they could end up really
overloaded. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/377-1
01:19:19.379 --> 01:19:22.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's a wider question.
So there's probably a couple of things</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/377-2
01:19:22.975 --> 01:19:26.861
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>for me to pick up on here.
So capacity is another thing that we're</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/377-3
01:19:26.861 --> 01:19:29.529
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>going to look at.
So from an ask perspective,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/377-4
01:19:29.529 --> 01:19:33.937
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we're looking to utilise the auto
assignment because what it will enable us</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/377-5
01:19:33.937 --> 01:19:35.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to do is to remove you haven't.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/378-0
01:19:35.855 --> 01:19:40.688
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Have somebody that does that assignment
task right from an efficiency perspective,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/378-1
01:19:40.688 --> 01:19:45.287
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but also because we're controlling how
they come in, they're auto categorised.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/378-2
01:19:45.287 --> 01:19:48.897
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So there's ways that we can manage that
work across the team.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/378-3
01:19:48.897 --> 01:19:52.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But so skills is one thing that we can
look at. So what?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/379-0
01:19:52.615 --> 01:19:55.951
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Processes that you can do.
Is there some that you can't do, etcetera?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/379-1
01:19:55.951 --> 01:19:59.334
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>How does that work within the team?
The other thing we will look at is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/379-2
01:19:59.334 --> 01:20:02.574
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>capacity, how we're going to do that.
Yeah, it hasn't been decided,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/379-3
01:20:02.574 --> 01:20:06.290
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it's a wider formulation, right.
So the system will help us support that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/379-4
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:08.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We will obviously communicate that as we
go through.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/380-0
01:20:09.535 --> 01:20:12.262
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It will be a change to how we work just
now for some teams.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/380-1
01:20:12.262 --> 01:20:15.488
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Some teams do auto categorise.
Some teams don't have people are saying</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/380-2
01:20:15.488 --> 01:20:18.306
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and they just pick them.
You know there's different ways that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/380-3
01:20:18.306 --> 01:20:20.760
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>people do it.
So there will be some changes in there.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/380-4
01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:23.077
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We'll communicate and manage what that
looks like.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/380-5
01:20:23.077 --> 01:20:26.667
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The guys need to take the information
away and find the right solution for us.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/380-6
01:20:26.667 --> 01:20:28.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And the other question I was going to ask.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/381-0
01:20:28.655 --> 01:20:32.254
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>About as well was in fact,
I think what would be really helpful here</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/381-1
01:20:32.254 --> 01:20:34.757
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is see when you guys get access to share,
well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/381-2
01:20:34.757 --> 01:20:39.034
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just because Gail's obviously explaining
there's so much variation and how people</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/381-3
01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:41.902
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>send them in,
you'd be as well looking at some of that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/381-4
01:20:41.902 --> 01:20:44.719
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because I think that will follow that.
Yeah, as well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/381-5
01:20:44.719 --> 01:20:46.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we can start as much as we can.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/382-0
01:20:47.135 --> 01:20:50.357
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But as as much as we can,
but that one easy way to start to receive</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/382-1
01:20:50.357 --> 01:20:53.768
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the price. Yeah. Yeah, of course.
The users in a certain way. But yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/382-2
01:20:53.768 --> 01:20:57.273
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we can have a look at that. Yeah,
because I think it's probably difficult</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/382-3
01:20:57.273 --> 01:20:59.595
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>for you guys to articulate it as well,
you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/382-4
01:20:59.595 --> 01:21:02.106
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so it's it's probably easier just to see
that. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/382-5
01:21:02.106 --> 01:21:05.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then the last question I was going to
ask about was a round prioritisation.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/383-0
01:21:06.295 --> 01:21:09.869
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I don't mean anything official, right,
but even within your team,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/383-1
01:21:09.869 --> 01:21:14.063
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and particularly talking about month end,
because I know you can switch a little</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/383-2
01:21:14.063 --> 01:21:18.310
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>bit at month end because your volumes go
up so much, maybe how you allocate work,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/383-3
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:20.744
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is there certain partners that you
prioritise,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/383-4
01:21:20.744 --> 01:21:23.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is there certain levels of payments that
you prioritise?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/385-0
01:21:24.135 --> 01:21:28.050
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And there might not be answers to that,
but just to have a think about it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/385-1
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:31.860
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because it'd be good to help us
understand your thinking around how that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/385-2
01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:35.984
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>works so that we can understand how the
system can perhaps support that rather</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/385-3
01:21:35.984 --> 01:21:38.437
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>than just having to do it on a reaction
basis.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/385-4
01:21:38.437 --> 01:21:41.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We can maybe control some of it in a
proactive basis.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/386-0
01:21:41.735 --> 01:21:46.036
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then you're just dealing with other
stuff that comes in that's normally that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/386-1
01:21:46.036 --> 01:21:49.010
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>sits outside that.
And I think that's what I was saying</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/386-2
01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:51.718
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>about thresholds or values or certain
partners or,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/386-3
01:21:51.718 --> 01:21:54.585
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know there might be and that might be
internally,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/386-4
01:21:54.585 --> 01:21:56.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but you that might not be an officialized.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/387-0
01:21:57.335 --> 01:22:01.395
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know, because it's noisy over here.
We know what that's like.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/387-1
01:22:01.395 --> 01:22:06.132
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It could be that that's a priority,
but not that I'm suggesting you put your</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/387-2
01:22:06.132 --> 01:22:08.961
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>partners into platinum, gold, silver,
bronze.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/387-3
01:22:08.961 --> 01:22:11.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But that any of those thresholds or.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/388-0
01:22:13.135 --> 01:22:18.265
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Clients that you know are, you know,
maybe high value or what but but also you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/388-1
01:22:18.265 --> 01:22:23.654
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>know the knock on effect is reputation as
well you know bills and the way in which</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/388-2
01:22:23.654 --> 01:22:28.524
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>he processes any of that matrix that can
aid I know probably the word auto</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/388-3
01:22:28.524 --> 01:22:32.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>assignment sounds horrific that if it
lands there but.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/389-0
01:22:32.295 --> 01:22:34.604
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>To hold your peace,
it's never going to be.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/389-1
01:22:34.604 --> 01:22:38.013
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's not how it works.
It's just really taking that scheduling</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/389-2
01:22:38.013 --> 01:22:41.528
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>off, you know, from you.
So it gets landed correctly and it can be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/389-3
01:22:41.528 --> 01:22:43.836
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>reassigned. It's not,
it's not an official.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/389-4
01:22:43.836 --> 01:22:47.561
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You said you were going to do it.
You're doing it. It's not like that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/389-5
01:22:47.561 --> 01:22:50.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And I appreciate that there could be high
volumes for the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/390-0
01:22:51.095 --> 01:22:54.930
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The the person that's getting it,
that can put them off and become</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/390-1
01:22:54.930 --> 01:22:58.134
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>overwhelming.
I also appreciate that and we can look at</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/390-2
01:22:58.134 --> 01:23:02.598
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that sort of cut off that once they've
got 10, that's enough. It gets rooted.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/390-3
01:23:02.598 --> 01:23:07.291
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So there's the system can do all of that.
It's just really easing that that who's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/390-4
01:23:07.291 --> 01:23:09.980
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>doing,
what's taking away that initial half an</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/390-5
01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:10.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>hour, 15.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/391-0
01:23:10.535 --> 01:23:13.171
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Minutes of the day,
but it's already done with you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/391-1
01:23:13.171 --> 01:23:16.819
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's in your queue and it becomes just
easier to manage the first time.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/391-2
01:23:16.819 --> 01:23:20.265
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Obviously I can tell tell that it's
probably going to be, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/391-3
01:23:20.265 --> 01:23:24.471
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>overwhelming, but once you get used to it,
it's actually a very powerful thing to,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/391-4
01:23:24.471 --> 01:23:27.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know, to have. I mean,
we generous a standard.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/392-0
01:23:28.055 --> 01:23:32.089
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Obviously it can change depending,
but for basic way of working is just you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/392-1
01:23:32.089 --> 01:23:34.477
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>know.
But first come first served trying now</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/392-2
01:23:34.477 --> 01:23:38.298
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>work on that. We would keep out.
I'll look out for anything that's much</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/392-3
01:23:38.298 --> 01:23:40.898
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>urgent,
but we also check because one of our pet</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/392-4
01:23:40.898 --> 01:23:45.090
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>fees is you always get people that just
say it's urgent and you're less blank.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/392-5
01:23:45.090 --> 01:23:46.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I've always got a wee bit like.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/393-0
01:23:47.015 --> 01:23:51.353
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Have to give a reason how to explain why,
but we'll keep on how I'll look out for</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/393-1
01:23:51.353 --> 01:23:54.527
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>them and what would that?
What would an example of that be?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/393-2
01:23:54.527 --> 01:23:58.494
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So would it be because it's due this
afternoon? Yeah, something like that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/393-3
01:23:58.494 --> 01:24:02.408
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's going to be how it's going to get
settled if they get it tonight or,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/393-4
01:24:02.408 --> 01:24:05.106
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know,
companies about going to administration,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/393-5
01:24:05.106 --> 01:24:06.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>anything like that, the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/394-0
01:24:06.935 --> 01:24:11.725
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm finishing early tonight and whatever,
it's just like we occur yesterday that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/394-1
01:24:11.725 --> 01:24:15.155
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>urgent and urgent and urgent becomes
white. Nor you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/394-2
01:24:15.155 --> 01:24:20.062
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they everything's urgent to an individual,
you know. And that's can be subjective.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/394-3
01:24:20.062 --> 01:24:24.911
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we said in some of the discussions all
week that part of the requests they can</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/394-4
01:24:24.911 --> 01:24:25.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know what the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/395-0
01:24:26.135 --> 01:24:29.434
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You date, you know that becomes yesterday.
It's very urgent,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/395-1
01:24:29.434 --> 01:24:33.381
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but you've said some very useful
categorization that administration what</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/395-2
01:24:33.381 --> 01:24:37.599
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it and they that could be captured.
And then as part of the Matrix in service</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/395-3
01:24:37.599 --> 01:24:40.627
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>now it picks up of that.
That's all into a pot and then</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/395-4
01:24:40.627 --> 01:24:43.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>prioritises for you.
So you don't have to scan through.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/396-0
01:24:44.135 --> 01:24:46.742
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know,
so it so it could be based on date and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/396-1
01:24:46.742 --> 01:24:49.402
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>those reasons that you mentioned that
they could,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/396-2
01:24:49.402 --> 01:24:52.647
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there'll always be a certain level of
sense checking, right.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/396-3
01:24:52.647 --> 01:24:56.264
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But the system can help that if we can
get those kind of key. Well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/396-4
01:24:56.264 --> 01:24:59.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we were discussing that the other day and
Louise was saying that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/397-0
01:25:00.175 --> 01:25:02.596
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Also, OK,
you don't want to make them complicated,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/397-1
01:25:02.596 --> 01:25:06.394
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but now if there was something along the
lines of if it was urgent but they had</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/397-2
01:25:06.394 --> 01:25:09.859
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>like a sort of drop down, yes,
exactly of now you have to see one or the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/397-3
01:25:09.859 --> 01:25:12.233
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>other. Yeah.
That's the kind of stuff that we can</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/397-4
01:25:12.233 --> 01:25:15.223
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>control on the way back.
And then when because what we ask and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/397-5
01:25:15.223 --> 01:25:18.451
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they're quite good at doing,
but what we've always asked for people</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/397-6
01:25:18.451 --> 01:25:19.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because you're always.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/399-0
01:25:19.655 --> 01:25:22.099
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>To be helpful,
but wouldn't ignore that that if</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/399-1
01:25:22.099 --> 01:25:24.950
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>something that's urgent at the moment
lawn chair. Well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/399-2
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:27.445
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you stay urgent at the start of subject
heading,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/399-3
01:25:27.445 --> 01:25:31.517
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because sometimes they have really long
subject headings and they put it at the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/399-4
01:25:31.517 --> 01:25:34.623
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>end just with a viewpoint you don't see
it, so would always.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/399-5
01:25:34.623 --> 01:25:37.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we would like if that was almost a
default.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/400-0
01:25:37.415 --> 01:25:40.928
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. So that it was always there.
You'd see it right away.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/400-1
01:25:40.928 --> 01:25:45.553
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So they won't be writing urgent. It will.
It will just be prioritised based on</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/400-2
01:25:45.553 --> 01:25:48.949
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>their selection.
And I know that they'll learn to get the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/400-3
01:25:48.949 --> 01:25:51.876
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>urgency,
but at least then you've got reasons why</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/400-4
01:25:51.876 --> 01:25:56.443
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know particularly that they can't
pick administrative reasons or you know</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/400-5
01:25:56.443 --> 01:25:56.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/401-0
01:25:56.815 --> 01:26:01.030
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Begin to add administration if it doesn't
exist, you know that would be an error,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/401-1
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:04.834
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but there if you can give us some example
though, that'd be very helpful.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/401-2
01:26:04.834 --> 01:26:08.534
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's just in thinking around with Canis
and that it was really helpful.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/401-3
01:26:08.534 --> 01:26:12.801
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There's a wider benefit because this team
is in the middle and then you have Rama,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/401-4
01:26:12.801 --> 01:26:16.296
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>who might not know. I mean,
who might if if they have the same rack</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/401-5
01:26:16.296 --> 01:26:16.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>status?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/402-0
01:26:16.775 --> 01:26:20.307
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>This is all the, you know, urgency,
statuses and all. It helps them,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/402-1
01:26:20.307 --> 01:26:23.940
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but then once they finish billing,
it helps E billing to pick up those</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/402-2
01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:27.113
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>urgent ones quickly.
So there's a wider impact of having this</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/402-3
01:26:27.113 --> 01:26:29.825
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>correctly done.
So that's the kind of thinking we're</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/402-4
01:26:29.825 --> 01:26:33.407
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>trying to help spark here I suppose is
you will have those scenarios,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/402-5
01:26:33.407 --> 01:26:36.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you'll know them.
They're just not written down anywhere.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/403-0
01:26:36.415 --> 01:26:40.093
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And we haven't actually categorised them.
That's what we're trying to do through</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/403-1
01:26:40.093 --> 01:26:43.271
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>this and that's the connections we do
need to kind of broader finance</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/403-2
01:26:43.271 --> 01:26:45.995
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>prioritisation because then it is an end
to end cycle here.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/403-3
01:26:45.995 --> 01:26:49.309
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we need to have it consistent across
each of those functions as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/403-4
01:26:49.309 --> 01:26:53.032
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So just a question Jill though when you
say we should have these scenarios mapped</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/403-5
01:26:53.032 --> 01:26:56.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>out, do we need it for the user stories,
I mean how urgent do we need?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/404-0
01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:59.440
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, I'm.
We do need it for the user stories.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/404-1
01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:03.136
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It doesn't have to be the first set of
user stories. I've got some time for you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/404-2
01:27:03.136 --> 01:27:06.330
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We can work on that as long as we're the
service. And then we go. OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/404-3
01:27:06.330 --> 01:27:09.342
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>how do I prioritise a service?
I can come and do it later as well</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/404-4
01:27:09.342 --> 01:27:11.943
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because you'll be writing the story,
you know. You know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/404-5
01:27:11.943 --> 01:27:14.498
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as I want to do the following with that,
prioritise it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/404-6
01:27:14.498 --> 01:27:16.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's not and it forms the basis.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/405-0
01:27:16.175 --> 01:27:19.610
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So the functional spec,
but it's the it's and it's the layers of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/405-1
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:24.101
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it, saturation through the process, right.
So we'll look at it first and we'll or we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/405-2
01:27:24.101 --> 01:27:28.010
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>didn't think about that or that's
prompted me to think that and it's just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/405-3
01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:30.863
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>understanding what things we're focusing
on just now.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/405-4
01:27:30.863 --> 01:27:33.505
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And it sounds like this is one that we
can, yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/405-5
01:27:33.505 --> 01:27:35.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And you picked up a good point that
actually.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/406-0
01:27:35.975 --> 01:27:39.192
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's urgent because it's urgent,
but as you said on ramas,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/406-1
01:27:39.192 --> 01:27:42.517
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it might be a low priority and you're
linking them actually,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/406-2
01:27:42.517 --> 01:27:45.134
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>although you don't deem it in urgent.
Actually,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/406-3
01:27:45.134 --> 01:27:49.277
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>can you readjust your priority because
it's really high priority for us and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/406-4
01:27:49.277 --> 01:27:51.948
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>therefore you need to up your priority
you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/406-5
01:27:51.948 --> 01:27:55.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so they can be linked so they're not
mutually exclusive.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/407-0
01:27:55.655 --> 01:27:59.237
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Overall story to be told for one
particular client. Yeah. No,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/407-1
01:27:59.237 --> 01:28:02.818
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I I think because I want to test the
scenarios for all right,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/407-2
01:28:02.818 --> 01:28:05.995
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's you've been soon washing it
throughout the whole.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/407-3
01:28:05.995 --> 01:28:10.790
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I had a sleep nest night because of our
discussion of yesterday and Julie's point.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/407-4
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:15.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's really important that it's a fine
ask finance approach to those because.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/408-0
01:28:15.615 --> 01:28:19.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>A lot of need the information from each
team so we can standardise it. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/408-1
01:28:19.495 --> 01:28:22.115
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because we need to.
What we were talking yesterday.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/408-2
01:28:22.115 --> 01:28:25.339
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There has to be few examples where end to
end is tested. Right?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/408-3
01:28:25.339 --> 01:28:29.117
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So like cashiers and everybody will be
involved in that scenario. So yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/408-4
01:28:29.117 --> 01:28:30.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And and test it with.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/409-0
01:28:31.135 --> 01:28:36.228
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Those that complex but don't test it with
happy part. You know test it with those.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/409-1
01:28:36.228 --> 01:28:41.013
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Those ones that make you you know,
walk to the coffee machine. Yeah, exactly.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/409-2
01:28:41.013 --> 01:28:45.430
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean that's that's the key to it is
that, you know, try and break it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/409-3
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:48.682
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Does it work?
Does it change the party where are the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/409-4
01:28:48.682 --> 01:28:50.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>bottlenecks? That's what.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/410-0
01:28:50.255 --> 01:28:54.313
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That we really, you know, want to push.
So you're getting a standard I service,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/410-1
01:28:54.313 --> 01:28:58.016
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but you're pushing the functionality of
the system to aids yourself just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/410-2
01:28:58.016 --> 01:29:00.958
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>conscious of time.
Do we need to move on to the next set?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/410-3
01:29:00.958 --> 01:29:04.762
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. We can move on. I mean, I mean,
even though they might be sound like</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/410-4
01:29:04.762 --> 01:29:08.921
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we're doing conversation by conscience,
that it does feed into when we come in to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/410-5
01:29:08.921 --> 01:29:09.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>manage the invoices.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/411-0
01:29:10.055 --> 01:29:12.364
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We've got that information,
so we won't be repeating it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/411-1
01:29:12.364 --> 01:29:13.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it's very helpful.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/412-0
01:29:16.055 --> 01:29:20.424
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And purging time coming the same way.
So should we move on to the manage</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/412-1
01:29:20.424 --> 01:29:23.356
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>invoice?
I mean we can have a quick break if you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/412-2
01:29:23.356 --> 01:29:27.186
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>want before we start,
but maybe we'll flag it up and we can see</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/412-3
01:29:27.186 --> 01:29:31.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the sorts of things and I captured,
you know I saw that you've got.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/413-0
01:29:31.695 --> 01:29:35.433
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Split you've got and.
Let me just have a quick look.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/413-1
01:29:35.433 --> 01:29:41.144
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There was a whole list of ego draught
invoicing, write offs, reversals, project,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/413-2
01:29:41.144 --> 01:29:45.304
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing, group billing,
the whole science in itself so but</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/413-3
01:29:45.304 --> 01:29:51.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>equally I've just wanted to touch upon
maybe if we have a quick break for drink.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/414-0
01:29:51.095 --> 01:29:53.572
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Something for 10 minutes we can come into
it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/414-1
01:29:53.572 --> 01:29:57.663
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it really is that sort of there's
probably a I'm hoping a sort of a new</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/414-2
01:29:57.663 --> 01:30:00.246
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that comes in new,
it's work in progress close.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/414-3
01:30:00.246 --> 01:30:04.176
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know that's sort of very high level
and then we can break down those</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/414-4
01:30:04.176 --> 01:30:05.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>scenarios maybe there's a.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/415-0
01:30:06.255 --> 01:30:09.284
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>A Crest for approval or we need to change
something,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/415-1
01:30:09.284 --> 01:30:13.513
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but they're tasks within the overall top
layer. You know that happy path?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/415-2
01:30:13.513 --> 01:30:17.170
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>These are the really easy, simple billing.
Proform is complete.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/415-3
01:30:17.170 --> 01:30:19.913
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Everything's complete. Great.
I've assigned it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/415-4
01:30:19.913 --> 01:30:22.827
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They're working and it's closed.
Complete perfect.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/415-5
01:30:22.827 --> 01:30:24.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then everything else.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/416-0
01:30:26.135 --> 01:30:28.458
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That that testing of it can come from
that,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/416-1
01:30:28.458 --> 01:30:32.363
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but I've taken it that that's sort of
high level and then we've got these</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/416-2
01:30:32.363 --> 01:30:35.688
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>actions and scenarios and hand offs that
might have to happen,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/416-3
01:30:35.688 --> 01:30:39.804
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but should we have a quick break and then
tackle is that is that OK with you?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/416-4
01:30:39.804 --> 01:30:43.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Would you like to do that or do you want
to just get straight into it just?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/417-0
01:30:45.655 --> 01:30:48.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>No, I mean I'm using. OK, do you have?
What should we do? Yeah, so.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/418-0
01:30:48.295 --> 01:30:51.775
<v Mark Sedge>Happy to happy to have a comfort break if
that's if that's OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/419-0
01:30:51.095 --> 01:30:54.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. OK,
1010 minute break and come back at 10:45.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/420-0
01:30:55.975 --> 01:30:56.535
<v Mark Sedge>Perfect.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/422-0
01:30:56.895 --> 01:30:57.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Thank you everybody.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/423-0
01:30:58.055 --> 01:30:58.455
<v Mark Sedge>Thanks.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/425-0
01:31:03.055 --> 01:31:06.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>No, seriously, I get that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/504-0
01:44:55.935 --> 01:44:56.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/510-0
01:45:28.175 --> 01:45:29.735
<v Mark Sedge>Hi team, we're all back on.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/512-0
01:45:35.935 --> 01:45:37.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK, let's do.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/514-0
01:45:40.295 --> 01:45:44.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Are you wanting it? Yeah, we're here,
Mark. We're just about to start.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/515-0
01:45:44.855 --> 01:45:47.255
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, no worries.
Just letting you know we're back on.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/516-0
01:45:48.335 --> 01:45:48.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Oh.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/517-0
01:45:58.975 --> 01:46:07.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>No, I was just going to plug it in.
That was all. Yes, please.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/518-0
01:46:07.655 --> 01:46:12.136
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Oh yes, I think that'd be helpful. OK,
that'd be great. OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/518-1
01:46:12.136 --> 01:46:17.812
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we're going to start manage invoice,
which will probably take a bulk of our</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/518-2
01:46:17.812 --> 01:46:21.919
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>conversations.
I think this was half of your processes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/518-3
01:46:21.919 --> 01:46:27.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and that's probably the reconciliation
and things that we've discussed.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/519-0
01:46:27.375 --> 01:46:31.934
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Already, but this is probably the bulk,
so you just want to describe that as we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/519-1
01:46:31.934 --> 01:46:36.322
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>said this morning that you get the pro
forma is raised by the P and then how</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/519-2
01:46:36.322 --> 01:46:40.026
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that then triggers your next stages and
how that comes into you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/519-3
01:46:40.026 --> 01:46:44.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So let me just start with that happy path.
So you've got a new query.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/520-0
01:46:44.775 --> 01:46:48.144
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>For the for the billing kind of raise an
invoice and then creation.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/520-1
01:46:48.144 --> 01:46:51.315
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So maybe you could just describe.
Well then we go line by line,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/520-2
01:46:51.315 --> 01:46:54.436
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so you've got the pro forma has been done.
It comes in to you,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/520-3
01:46:54.436 --> 01:46:56.863
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>do you deem that sort of term it simple
billing,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/520-4
01:46:56.863 --> 01:47:01.074
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>maybe we should start with simple billing
and how that comes in, so who requests it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/520-5
01:47:01.074 --> 01:47:02.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>how you capture it?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/521-0
01:47:02.335 --> 01:47:06.998
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What information do you need?
And as it lands with your team? Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/521-1
01:47:06.998 --> 01:47:10.290
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>well,
the most basics simple billing is is see.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/521-2
01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:15.090
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Ideally that's supposed to come in
through the three E simple billing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/521-3
01:47:15.090 --> 01:47:18.313
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>approval,
but some will still come through via</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/521-4
01:47:18.313 --> 01:47:21.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>e-mail and that would just be a case of.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/522-0
01:47:21.495 --> 01:47:26.371
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know the matter number.
It may even be just getting build up.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/522-1
01:47:26.371 --> 01:47:32.281
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What value occasionally that just build
all and it's just like everything on it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/522-2
01:47:32.281 --> 01:47:36.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>build it all as is and sent to us and
that's as simple as you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/523-0
01:47:37.935 --> 01:47:42.378
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So essentially in three they will trigger
that process for you. Is that right?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/523-1
01:47:42.378 --> 01:47:46.259
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is that how the PES trigger it?
And then you come and then you get a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/523-2
01:47:46.259 --> 01:47:50.252
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ticket into chair world today and then
you pick it up, is it approved?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/523-3
01:47:50.252 --> 01:47:54.582
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it comes in as approval for for
billing if it comes if it comes through 3</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/523-4
01:47:54.582 --> 01:47:56.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>E, we don't get anything through share.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/524-0
01:47:56.895 --> 01:47:59.890
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Well, OK,
so there's two separate two separate</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/524-1
01:47:59.890 --> 01:48:03.203
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>processes.
All were replaced through share well and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/524-2
01:48:03.203 --> 01:48:07.790
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>those that are sitting on free on more
sort of like action list on more</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/524-3
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:11.231
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>dashboards,
that's the majority of your activity when</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/524-4
01:48:11.231 --> 01:48:14.799
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you're working in three for those,
is that right? Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/524-5
01:48:14.799 --> 01:48:16.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>On that one doing them so.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/525-0
01:48:16.975 --> 01:48:20.849
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That would be some of those will still
come through e-mail as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/525-1
01:48:20.849 --> 01:48:23.754
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's it's always a wee bit of we will
accept both,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/525-2
01:48:23.754 --> 01:48:27.798
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it's encouraged to send you know your
most simple ones through 3E,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/525-3
01:48:27.798 --> 01:48:31.387
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but that's probably,
I mean that's as simple as you could get.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/525-4
01:48:31.387 --> 01:48:33.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Would you agree just you know?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/526-0
01:48:33.815 --> 01:48:37.437
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Fellow as is other ones,
it may just be yard building all but,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/526-1
01:48:37.437 --> 01:48:40.771
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but they don't.
They don't say Bill or I mean that's a 3E</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/526-2
01:48:40.771 --> 01:48:45.140
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>activity. The fact that they've clicked,
so they've done the pro forma, no,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/526-3
01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:48.071
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they would need to state that in it.
But OK, yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/526-4
01:48:48.071 --> 01:48:50.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there's like a sort of field box that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/527-0
01:48:50.575 --> 01:48:54.442
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They they can either attach.
Is he a billing guide or just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/527-1
01:48:54.442 --> 01:48:57.916
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>instructions,
or there's a sort of internal comments</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/527-2
01:48:57.916 --> 01:49:03.224
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>box on and in that it's usually that or
the with dental information and some the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/527-3
01:49:03.224 --> 01:49:07.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>literally will just write below.
Others would see, you know, Bill.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/528-0
01:49:09.135 --> 01:49:13.896
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Bill fees of 20,
000 either carry forward balance or write</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/528-1
01:49:13.896 --> 01:49:17.850
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>off balance.
How our bill X amount fees plus all</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/528-2
01:49:17.850 --> 01:49:23.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>disbursements or Bill X amount fees,
but write off disbursements.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/529-0
01:49:23.735 --> 01:49:27.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's all three E activity that doesn't
land in Cheryl today. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/529-1
01:49:27.455 --> 01:49:31.715
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And I'm just thinking that's probably,
you know, you're in three E constantly.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/529-2
01:49:31.715 --> 01:49:33.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Presumably that's your landing page.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/530-0
01:49:36.375 --> 01:49:39.046
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What the hell? That you know,
stays in there. I mean,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/530-1
01:49:39.046 --> 01:49:41.519
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's probably a conversation as we go
into. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/530-2
01:49:41.519 --> 01:49:45.377
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I think the stuff that comes through
the last action list just we don't we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/530-3
01:49:45.377 --> 01:49:49.581
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>don't cover any of that just now it's not
in share. Well, purposely for that reason.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/530-4
01:49:49.581 --> 01:49:52.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's just the other stuff that comes
through e-mail. We just need.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/530-5
01:49:52.895 --> 01:49:55.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's stuff that then hits you. Yeah,
so we've been.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/531-0
01:49:56.015 --> 01:50:01.867
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So get similar requests along that same
basis of again just coming in with ensure</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/531-1
01:50:01.867 --> 01:50:05.649
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>will they might attach a billing guide or
a draught.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/531-2
01:50:05.649 --> 01:50:09.430
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So how do they trigger that differently
in 3E today,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/531-3
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:12.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>how it's just a sort of personal
preference on?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/532-0
01:50:13.135 --> 01:50:18.808
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Whether how they want to request it,
some will use the simple pro forma</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/532-1
01:50:18.808 --> 01:50:23.850

<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>amount fees?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/533-0
01:50:31.735 --> 01:50:34.989
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Etcetera.
Raises the question or challenging it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/533-1
01:50:34.989 --> 01:50:38.038
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that it's a preference,
personal preference,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/533-2
01:50:38.038 --> 01:50:42.579
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but should they be using the three E
functionality to say I'm not,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/533-3
01:50:42.579 --> 01:50:46.849
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm not diverting that actually diverting
these queries, yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/533-4
01:50:46.849 --> 01:50:49.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But I'm just thinking that if that is the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/534-0
01:50:51.895 --> 01:50:56.637
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Operation that they're doing or can do in
the functionalities there should they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/534-1
01:50:56.637 --> 01:50:59.126
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>should they?
Shouldn't they be using that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/534-2
01:50:59.126 --> 01:51:01.912
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>functionality rather than
circumnavigating it?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/534-3
01:51:01.912 --> 01:51:04.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sounds through raising your request.
Ideally, yes,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/534-4
01:51:04.935 --> 01:51:09.439
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we try to encourage it and we do have
that we have got a category of ensure</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/534-5
01:51:09.439 --> 01:51:09.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/535-0
01:51:10.295 --> 01:51:13.814
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Which we use where if we have gone back
to to see good,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/535-1
01:51:13.814 --> 01:51:18.401
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>can you submit this through for the E
please a lot of the times we don't</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/535-2
01:51:18.401 --> 01:51:23.428
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because especially seeing one vend and
it's really busy so share wheels and how</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/535-3
01:51:23.428 --> 01:51:25.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we've got it now just so many tickets.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/536-0
01:51:26.215 --> 01:51:29.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The time we might get down to that ticket
and see, oh,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/536-1
01:51:29.135 --> 01:51:32.214
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you should really have submitted that
through sheet a 3E.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/536-2
01:51:32.214 --> 01:51:36.090
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If we then go back to them three ES
already got hundreds already sitting</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/536-3
01:51:36.090 --> 01:51:38.638
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>waiting.
They're going to go really back to the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/536-4
01:51:38.638 --> 01:51:40.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>end of the queue. So instead of being.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/538-0
01:51:41.055 --> 01:51:46.818
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Now, just awkward. We would action it,
but on maybe if we support it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/538-1
01:51:46.818 --> 01:51:51.428
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>maybe really early on we how we will
sometimes go back.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/538-2
01:51:51.428 --> 01:51:57.438
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The problem with with the 3E ones,
there seems to be confusion sometimes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/538-3
01:51:57.438 --> 01:52:00.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>with the P ES and as much as we explained.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/539-0
01:52:00.975 --> 01:52:06.149
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>As what comes under simple billing for
them to do it so quite often they'll</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/539-1
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:11.730
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>submit one through 3 E that which we have
to return back just because they either</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/539-2
01:52:11.730 --> 01:52:17.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>want to be issued as a split bill or
something like that, and we can't do that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/540-0
01:52:17.735 --> 01:52:21.767
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Just the the the way they've sent it in.
So we need to see send an e-mail and so I</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/540-1
01:52:21.767 --> 01:52:25.555
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>think sometimes they just don't get it.
So they just go, I'll send an e-mail.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/540-2
01:52:25.555 --> 01:52:28.810
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, let's look in a check. Sorry,
Julian. So I was going to say,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/540-3
01:52:28.810 --> 01:52:30.995
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is it do you have like some FAQs,
knowledge.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/540-4
01:52:30.995 --> 01:52:34.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So let's say I'm as I'm brand new Tasha,
so I'm going to be a.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/541-0
01:52:34.575 --> 01:52:38.185
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm have to do all the the bills as well.
How would I know that?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/541-1
01:52:38.185 --> 01:52:42.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I need to simple in billing or I need to
split this one or there might be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/541-2
01:52:42.295 --> 01:52:46.737
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>different matters and I need to, you know,
consider that into the bill as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/541-3
01:52:46.737 --> 01:52:50.069
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>How do I do that?
We've got we a sort of a hence tips check</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/541-4
01:52:50.069 --> 01:52:50.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>box that we.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/542-0
01:52:51.415 --> 01:52:54.021
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Well,
we don't send them out to every new PE</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/542-1
01:52:54.021 --> 01:52:56.569
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because we don't know when new PES come
in.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/542-2
01:52:56.569 --> 01:53:01.201
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But the OPS team as far as what we're do
because every PE get it and it gives a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/542-3
01:53:01.201 --> 01:53:05.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>sort of explanation of what's not a
simple bill like what should come into EE.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/544-0
01:53:06.575 --> 01:53:11.979
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What not to, but again, I'm, you know,
it's probably overloads that they get and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/544-1
01:53:11.979 --> 01:53:15.182
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>by the time they're doing bills they,
you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/544-2
01:53:15.182 --> 01:53:20.319
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they they look at now I think there's an
opportunity to push that to people.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/543-0
01:53:19.575 --> 01:53:19.735
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/544-3
01:53:20.319 --> 01:53:25.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Obviously when they're coming to service
now and show them that information.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/546-0
01:53:26.255 --> 01:53:29.457
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, actually,
do you know you can do this directly on</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/546-1
01:53:29.457 --> 01:53:33.572
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>three E like that tape method.
I think it needs to be soft because it's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/546-2
01:53:33.572 --> 01:53:36.945
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that wider behaviour piece, right?
We can't switch it off.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/546-3
01:53:36.945 --> 01:53:41.289
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We will need to still provide the the
option, but hopefully as we progress,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/545-0
01:53:38.255 --> 01:53:38.455
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/548-0
01:53:40.975 --> 01:53:45.371
<v Mark Sedge>The the the one of the questions that
went through my mind then is if you could</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/546-4
01:53:41.289 --> 01:53:42.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we can change that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/548-1
01:53:45.371 --> 01:53:49.712
<v Mark Sedge>wave a wand and say what would be the
most consistent way you'd want to get it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/548-2
01:53:49.712 --> 01:53:53.777
<v Mark Sedge>anything through what would that be?
Would that be via controlled form or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/548-3
01:53:53.777 --> 01:53:57.459
<v Mark Sedge>would that be via three?
Because it sounds like there's issues and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/548-4
01:53:57.459 --> 01:54:00.535
<v Mark Sedge>complexities where they come through the
three E route.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/549-0
01:54:00.975 --> 01:54:03.737
<v Mark Sedge>Or whether they sling an e-mail to you
directly.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/549-1
01:54:03.737 --> 01:54:07.230
<v Mark Sedge>So if you could wave a wand and say what
would be your ideal,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/549-2
01:54:07.230 --> 01:54:08.695
<v Mark Sedge>what would that look like?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/551-0
01:54:10.775 --> 01:54:13.372
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But it probably sounds like if you're in
three E,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/551-1
01:54:13.372 --> 01:54:17.110
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>everything's in three E you work in 3 E
is that right? In Utopia world,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/551-2
01:54:17.110 --> 01:54:21.004
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's where it's living its life,
and you're getting the queries of them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/550-0
01:54:20.535 --> 01:54:20.695
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/551-3
01:54:21.004 --> 01:54:24.794
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It sounds like that actually the ones
that you can do in three E you do,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/551-4
01:54:24.794 --> 01:54:28.637
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because that's your all the bills.
All the bills have to be processed for</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/551-5
01:54:28.637 --> 01:54:29.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you, right? So.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/552-0
01:54:30.295 --> 01:54:34.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Come out of that. Yeah,
the problems by the was request as.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/553-0
01:54:34.175 --> 01:54:38.185
<v Mark Sedge>Sorry, it's one sorry.
There was multi conversations and go on</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/553-1
01:54:38.185 --> 01:54:38.375
<v Mark Sedge>go.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/554-0
01:54:38.815 --> 01:54:44.408
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So with the ones that committed 3E,
so all we see on the action list is a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/554-1
01:54:44.408 --> 01:54:49.850
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>matter number and it times there will be
a value, but that's the total.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/554-2
01:54:49.850 --> 01:54:52.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What value on that pro forma which?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/556-0
01:54:52.855 --> 01:54:57.658
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We try to look at that at one end because,
but quite often you'll see oh £1,000,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/556-1
01:54:57.658 --> 01:55:02.104
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>000 and you open it up and it says,
can you build 20 and carry forward the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/556-2
01:55:02.104 --> 01:55:05.305
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>balance? And unfortunately,
once you've opened it up,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/556-3
01:55:05.305 --> 01:55:08.210
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that shoe got that ticket,
it's assigned to you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/556-4
01:55:08.210 --> 01:55:12.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So you can't go in and have a quick view
to see or window at these requests.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/555-0
01:55:09.935 --> 01:55:12.095
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/558-0
01:55:12.855 --> 01:55:17.000
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So if they're urgent,
the PE then also has to send a safe</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/558-1
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.787
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>e-mail into us to say I've submitted a
request through 3E for master number blah</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/557-0
01:55:22.055 --> 01:55:22.455
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/558-2
01:55:22.787 --> 01:55:28.360
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>blah. It's actually urgent because again,
we can't see any of the information</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/558-3
01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:32.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>unless we open the request and then it's
locked to you so.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/559-0
01:55:32.855 --> 01:55:34.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's actually.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/560-0
01:55:33.895 --> 01:55:36.938
<v Mark Sedge>So so GAIL,
that's why that's why I was asking the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/560-1
01:55:36.938 --> 01:55:41.055
<v Mark Sedge>question and I'll ask it again if you
could wave a wand, what would?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/560-2
01:55:41.055 --> 01:55:44.933
<v Mark Sedge>What would you really want?
Because it feels to me you'd want A1</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/560-3
01:55:44.933 --> 01:55:49.289
<v Mark Sedge>doorway in consistently to give you the
ability to pick, choose, assign,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/560-4
01:55:49.289 --> 01:55:51.615
<v Mark Sedge>assess before it gets locked up, right?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/561-0
01:55:52.415 --> 01:55:59.279
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, I mean my, if I had to choose,
I would probably just go everything come</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/561-1
01:55:59.279 --> 01:56:06.231
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>in by e-mail just because you've got
better visibility of it also on the three</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/561-2
01:56:06.231 --> 01:56:08.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>system would be ballot.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/562-0
01:56:08.695 --> 01:56:13.236
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It automatically goes back to the PE and
it's almost like they get an e-mail,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/562-1
01:56:13.236 --> 01:56:17.194
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we have no visibility.
So even if we put a note on it saying XY</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/562-2
01:56:17.194 --> 01:56:21.036
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>or ZA bit of information,
it doesn't appear in any sent items and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/562-3
01:56:21.036 --> 01:56:24.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it doesn't show it's not to be found
anywhere in the E.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/563-0
01:56:23.215 --> 01:56:25.415
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, so, so so.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/564-0
01:56:24.975 --> 01:56:27.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And you can't see any of your records of
anything.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/565-0
01:56:31.815 --> 01:56:31.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/566-0
01:56:33.175 --> 01:56:33.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Mm-hmm.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/568-0
01:56:33.815 --> 01:56:38.469
<v Mark Sedge>Consistent form where you had all that
visibility your other folks could</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/567-0
01:56:33.975 --> 01:56:34.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/568-1
01:56:38.469 --> 01:56:43.441
<v Mark Sedge>potentially see that see that record if
required and what have you that feels</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/568-2
01:56:43.441 --> 01:56:48.349
<v Mark Sedge>like that's the favourable route and
therefore it may be that there's we use</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/568-3
01:56:48.349 --> 01:56:53.575
<v Mark Sedge>this opportunity to redirect so that you
don't have the challenges that you face.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/570-0
01:56:53.695 --> 01:56:58.502
<v Mark Sedge>With the E triggered mechanism,
you have the controlled route that says</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/570-1
01:56:58.502 --> 01:57:02.508
<v Mark Sedge>if it all comes in,
you know via a controlled form you know</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/570-2
01:57:02.508 --> 01:57:07.982
<v Mark Sedge>whether it's e-mail triggered or whatever.
But if you can steer the audience that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/570-3
01:57:07.982 --> 01:57:13.055
<v Mark Sedge>wants something out of you to go via that
route, it gives you more control.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/573-0
01:57:13.415 --> 01:57:18.129
<v Mark Sedge>Than any of the other elements.
So operationally it feels like we should</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/573-1
01:57:18.129 --> 01:57:22.906
<v Mark Sedge>be trying to pursue that route for you
rather than you look to say what's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/571-0
01:57:21.935 --> 01:57:22.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/573-2
01:57:22.906 --> 01:57:26.070
<v Mark Sedge>happening elsewhere.
Do you see what I'm coming?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/573-3
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:30.073
<v Mark Sedge>Where I'm coming from?
I'm just thinking we're on the cusp of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/573-4
01:57:30.073 --> 01:57:32.655
<v Mark Sedge>being able to do something really smart.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/572-0
01:57:33.135 --> 01:57:33.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yep.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/574-0
01:57:33.135 --> 01:57:36.229
<v Mark Sedge>And if that's the best route,
then why don't we? You know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/574-1
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:40.267
<v Mark Sedge>it's like forcing everybody to come
through the side door if that's the best</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/574-2
01:57:40.267 --> 01:57:43.255
<v Mark Sedge>way to get people in in,
then let's route them that way.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/575-0
01:57:44.655 --> 01:57:45.855
<v Mark Sedge>Just just to my point.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/576-0
01:57:44.935 --> 01:57:48.100
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, it's totally.
I think it's probably something we just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/576-1
01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:52.162
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>need to be mindful of because it's a
change to the process before it gets to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/576-2
01:57:52.162 --> 01:57:55.221
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>us because you obviously have people
where P ES partners,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/576-3
01:57:55.221 --> 01:57:59.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>whoever it is that will have access to be
able to go in and raise those bills</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/576-4
01:57:59.335 --> 01:58:03.503
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>directly in three E so it's probably just
more of a change piece around how we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/576-5
01:58:03.503 --> 01:58:04.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>manage that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/578-0
01:58:04.255 --> 01:58:07.833
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Because it's a change outside of.
Ask around how that comes in,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/578-1
01:58:07.833 --> 01:58:12.025
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but I suppose there is also conversations.
I'm not saying it's not doable,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/578-2
01:58:12.025 --> 01:58:15.882
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's just something we need. You know,
I suppose there's always also</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/578-3
01:58:15.882 --> 01:58:17.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>conversations around.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/579-0
01:58:18.655 --> 01:58:23.576
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If we manage that traffic through service
now and whatever form it is and we start</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/579-1
01:58:23.576 --> 01:58:27.904
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>getting all our bills in there,
is there a way that we can then automate</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/579-2
01:58:27.904 --> 01:58:32.528
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and talk back to three E so that these
guys are the gatekeepers to be able to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/579-3
01:58:32.528 --> 01:58:35.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>see this is urgent,
whatever the criteria is?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/580-0
01:58:35.695 --> 01:58:38.213
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then that information can get put in
a three,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/580-1
01:58:38.213 --> 01:58:41.386
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so they're not double key in that.
I suppose that's the other.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/580-2
01:58:41.386 --> 01:58:44.508
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I know it's an integration,
but it's just something we should</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/580-3
01:58:44.508 --> 01:58:47.983
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>consider as a use case. Yeah.
So if we are going to use service now,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/580-4
01:58:47.983 --> 01:58:51.105
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I was going to add,
it sounds like free E should be the place</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/580-5
01:58:51.105 --> 01:58:53.573
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to do it.
But because of the limitations and the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/580-6
01:58:53.573 --> 01:58:55.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the inability to track and get the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/581-0
01:58:55.415 --> 01:58:58.230
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Transparency you need.
That's where you're going actually with</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/581-1
01:58:58.230 --> 01:59:00.241
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>e-mail.
I can then start to get all of those</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/581-2
01:59:00.241 --> 01:59:03.726
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>places and I can track it and look at all
these different requests coming in.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/581-3
01:59:03.726 --> 01:59:06.362
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we know obviously there's going to be
updates to three.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/581-4
01:59:06.362 --> 01:59:09.445
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't know what if those I was going to
see is that sort of stuff.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/581-5
01:59:09.445 --> 01:59:11.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm getting no idea.
Something we can check.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/582-0
01:59:12.615 --> 01:59:16.377
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, Alex,
to help us with in that wider integration</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/582-1
01:59:16.377 --> 01:59:20.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>piece and conversation,
but it it make it makes sense because</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/582-2
01:59:20.695 --> 01:59:25.710
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we've also got another issue when it
automatically goes back to whoever</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/582-3
01:59:25.710 --> 01:59:26.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>submitted it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/583-0
01:59:28.935 --> 01:59:33.876
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I've seen that appear especially at one
vendor. Maybe somebody from like the hub,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/583-1
01:59:33.876 --> 01:59:38.697
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>who I know some do like 70 in the House,
7 in the morning, 60 clocks up shifts,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/583-2
01:59:38.697 --> 01:59:42.734
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so they're then off. So it's again,
it's went back to them. So no,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/583-3
01:59:42.734 --> 01:59:45.927
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the partner doesn't see it or if they go
on holiday,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/583-4
01:59:45.927 --> 01:59:47.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know it's you mean like any.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/584-0
01:59:48.015 --> 01:59:52.385
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Updates directly through 3 E go to them,
so you have got no sight of it. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/584-1
01:59:52.385 --> 01:59:56.479
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Or again, if we've got a query.
If if they they have submitted at the end</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/584-2
01:59:56.479 --> 01:59:59.908
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>correctly we've got the option,
we just turn it back to them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/584-3
01:59:59.908 --> 02:00:03.835
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But again if they've then when let's say
they're off SEC or something,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/584-4
02:00:03.835 --> 02:00:07.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but you don't get an out of office,
it's you don't get updates.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/585-0
02:00:07.535 --> 02:00:11.176
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The area. They know what? Yeah. Yeah.
Just just. Yeah. On that piece.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/585-1
02:00:11.176 --> 02:00:15.493
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Obviously we've been chatting to some of
the core systems teams this week in terms</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/585-2
02:00:15.493 --> 02:00:19.810
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of integration opportunities and how we
would exchange it and where from etcetera.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/585-3
02:00:19.810 --> 02:00:23.971
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And there is challenges there as well
around some of the moratoriums and change</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/585-4
02:00:23.971 --> 02:00:27.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that we have because some of those
platforms themselves are under.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/586-0
02:00:27.535 --> 02:00:31.126
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Go and you know a piece of work similar
to chairwell.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/586-1
02:00:31.126 --> 02:00:36.046
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I think we the key thing is that we
identify the opportunity. However,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/586-2
02:00:36.046 --> 02:00:40.566
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it may be a future phase and you know I
think Jill, you and I have,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/586-3
02:00:40.566 --> 02:00:44.024
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know being studying a few things.
Yeah, agreed.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/586-4
02:00:44.024 --> 02:00:47.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think it's just it's like the and I
think.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/587-0
02:00:47.335 --> 02:00:50.010
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I just spoke to the young chap there
about it yesterday.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/587-1
02:00:50.010 --> 02:00:53.481
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's one of the things that would be
really good on these processes is to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/587-2
02:00:53.481 --> 02:00:57.141
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>understand the whole kind of racy piece
because there's a lot of stuff where,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/587-3
02:00:57.141 --> 02:00:59.299
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know,
you guys are taking accountability,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/587-4
02:00:59.299 --> 02:01:03.099
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but actually it's elsewhere and it would
just be quite good to to highlight that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/587-5
02:01:03.099 --> 02:01:04.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because if we are all meeting workflows.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/588-0
02:01:05.815 --> 02:01:08.973
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I was at least wanting a person
accountable to see it in parallel with</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/588-1
02:01:08.973 --> 02:01:12.398
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>somebody who's actually delivering.
I think that goes along with some of the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/588-2
02:01:12.398 --> 02:01:15.911
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>work that's happening in service design
around global process owners etcetera.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/588-3
02:01:15.911 --> 02:01:19.336
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's all it's happening in tandem.
We just need to make sure it's we just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/588-4
02:01:19.336 --> 02:01:22.583
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>need to make sure it's a connected
conversation and that's what a lot of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/588-5
02:01:22.583 --> 02:01:24.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>stuff we're doing.
We like to the three teams that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/589-0
02:01:26.375 --> 02:01:29.951
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think, Alex,
what we need to understand is that is the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/589-1
02:01:29.951 --> 02:01:34.592
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>functionality going to be there on the
upgraded 3 E version or not? Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/589-2
02:01:34.592 --> 02:01:38.355
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So if the upgrade,
obviously one of this we had a chat with</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/589-3
02:01:38.355 --> 02:01:42.683
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>him yesterday, we know PTP,
PTP for example what's coming and that's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/589-4
02:01:42.683 --> 02:01:44.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>taking functionality out of three.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/590-0
02:01:44.975 --> 02:01:47.826
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah,
the new version of three does bring some</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/590-1
02:01:47.826 --> 02:01:50.798
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>opportunities around the APIs etcetera.
However,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/590-2
02:01:50.798 --> 02:01:55.589
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we have whether they'll be resource to
facilitate using that you know with the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/590-3
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:59.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>timelines that we're under in terms of
constraints for next September.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/591-0
02:02:00.495 --> 02:02:00.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/592-0
02:02:02.055 --> 02:02:06.283
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Everything, everything else is saying.
I don't check if you can,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/592-1
02:02:06.283 --> 02:02:10.446
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just checking who's around here,
but my sorry I didn't do that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/592-2
02:02:10.446 --> 02:02:13.893
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I just spoke.
But you you were diplomatic and we had</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/592-3
02:02:13.893 --> 02:02:18.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>couple of finance related sessions.
I'm sorry. I'm off track over here.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/593-0
02:02:19.335 --> 02:02:23.315
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We realised actually,
everybody realise there are</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/593-1
02:02:23.315 --> 02:02:29.284
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>functionalities already existing in 3E
right now with the current version,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/593-2
02:02:29.284 --> 02:02:34.457
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>which we are not using,
which doesn't need anybody to kind of do</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/593-3
02:02:34.457 --> 02:02:34.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>any.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/594-0
02:02:35.455 --> 02:02:38.523
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What do you call the the build or
anything?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/594-1
02:02:38.523 --> 02:02:42.845
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It is just a mere knowledge gap from a
technical perspective,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/594-2
02:02:42.845 --> 02:02:47.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so we could be using those,
but we are not technical meanings from a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/594-3
02:02:47.655 --> 02:02:52.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>configuration and setup point of view
correct from from totally from.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/595-0
02:02:53.215 --> 02:02:56.102
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Three perspective, yeah.
So maybe we can part that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/595-1
02:02:56.102 --> 02:03:00.321
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know exactly as a whole. Again,
I would really like to see that list of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/595-2
02:03:00.321 --> 02:03:04.151
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>stuff because if these going through an
upgrade programme and speak,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/595-3
02:03:04.151 --> 02:03:08.259
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we have to speak to Chris on Monday,
he has a list already on the working</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/595-4
02:03:08.259 --> 02:03:12.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>capital side because yesterday,
so paric and Mark are listening within.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/598-0
02:03:12.415 --> 02:03:15.602
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Content as well to to that.
So because that was a surprise,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/598-1
02:03:15.602 --> 02:03:19.690
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>he's beaten. So they. Yeah. Yeah,
because the like, what we received was oh,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/596-0
02:03:18.095 --> 02:03:18.495
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/598-2
02:03:19.690 --> 02:03:22.345
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's already there why you're not using
it? Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/598-3
02:03:22.345 --> 02:03:26.700
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think that's a good challenge to make.
But maybe if I can just park as we don't</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/597-0
02:03:23.695 --> 02:03:24.015
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/598-4
02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:30.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>grow arms and legs probably we probably.
Oh it's not a three-year workshop.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/600-0
02:03:29.655 --> 02:03:32.613
<v Mark Sedge>I was just.
I was just going to say let's let's. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/600-1
02:03:32.613 --> 02:03:36.000
<v Mark Sedge>exactly. Let's park it.
I think that the principle is where we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/599-0
02:03:34.415 --> 02:03:34.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/600-2
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.011
<v Mark Sedge>think there's an opportunity.
We need to to Alex Point,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/600-3
02:03:39.011 --> 02:03:41.215
<v Mark Sedge>just record it and then we'll explore it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/601-0
02:03:41.855 --> 02:03:44.544
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But Santee,
that wasn't A and these things are great</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/601-1
02:03:44.544 --> 02:03:48.298
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to raise here because you know,
we and then we can just capture them all.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/601-2
02:03:48.298 --> 02:03:52.509
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't want to cut you off at the past,
but it's, you know, I think raising them,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/601-3
02:03:52.509 --> 02:03:56.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we've raised quite a few this week.
We've seen the opportunities that can be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/601-4
02:03:56.415 --> 02:03:58.647
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>had.
But so I didn't I know that we can sit</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/601-5
02:03:58.647 --> 02:04:01.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>here all day. We should park it.
But there is a fun.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/602-0
02:04:01.535 --> 02:04:04.689
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So you can just park them. As I said,
we should definitely park it and keep it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/602-1
02:04:04.689 --> 02:04:07.004
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and look at that use case,
but that actually could have a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/602-2
02:04:07.004 --> 02:04:10.198
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>fundamental way in which we might build
some of our services as well because of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/602-3
02:04:10.198 --> 02:04:12.313
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the functionality that you might be
missing. So yes,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/602-4
02:04:12.313 --> 02:04:15.387
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but let's let's take away and have a look.
But that also informs our design.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/602-5
02:04:15.387 --> 02:04:17.223
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we just need to be very conscious of
that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/602-6
02:04:17.223 --> 02:04:19.458
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Definitely don't want us building
something in service.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/602-7
02:04:19.458 --> 02:04:20.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Now if there's a 3D capability that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/603-0
02:04:21.135 --> 02:04:25.070
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's not using. You're paying for it.
You might. You should really be using it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/603-1
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:28.316
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Platform is no it has been upgraded,
but it's not going anywhere.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/603-2
02:04:28.316 --> 02:04:32.103
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So if it does have a native capability,
we should definitely use that. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/603-3
02:04:32.103 --> 02:04:34.611
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it sounds like. I mean,
this is where you do your.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/603-4
02:04:34.611 --> 02:04:37.316
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>This is where it lives and breeds three
years. I mean.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/603-5
02:04:37.316 --> 02:04:39.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's now it's to age your queries.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/604-0
02:04:39.575 --> 02:04:43.043
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Help you do this quiz,
but you're in three where you're living</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/604-1
02:04:43.043 --> 02:04:45.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and breathing.
It's where the information is.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/604-2
02:04:45.575 --> 02:04:50.144
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's your Alex. I can feel that your data,
you know, that is correct and complete.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/604-3
02:04:50.144 --> 02:04:54.437
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But this is just another fairly long
rabbit hole that we're running down here</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/604-4
02:04:54.437 --> 02:04:58.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>talking about CE and everything else.
But all I'm really keen in is that we use.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/605-0
02:04:59.015 --> 02:05:01.555
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>This programme,
because it touches in so many of the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/605-1
02:05:01.555 --> 02:05:05.196
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>processes around the whole business,
to surface some of these challenges so</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/605-2
02:05:05.196 --> 02:05:09.221
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that there can be a decision made on them
because we can choose to ignore it and do</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/605-3
02:05:09.221 --> 02:05:13.150
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>nothing and continue to go in as we are,
or we can look to be make it a part of a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/605-4
02:05:13.150 --> 02:05:16.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>later phase. We can do many, many things.
But the key thing is unless we tilt.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/606-0
02:05:17.615 --> 02:05:20.398
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Decision makers.
They need to make a decision. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/606-1
02:05:20.398 --> 02:05:23.969
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Life will just continue as normal and
then back to everything else.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/606-2
02:05:23.969 --> 02:05:27.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So these queries, as Mark alluded to,
is like really driving that as much</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/606-3
02:05:27.855 --> 02:05:31.950
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>information into as you said it had a
value, but they only want to pay trend,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/606-4
02:05:31.950 --> 02:05:32.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know, so it's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/607-0
02:05:33.215 --> 02:05:37.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If we look at prioritisation metrics of
this is a really high value.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/607-1
02:05:37.455 --> 02:05:40.957
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We'll do this one,
but yet they only want a very minimal</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/607-2
02:05:40.957 --> 02:05:45.074
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>percentage of it to be paid.
You know you can you can capture that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/607-3
02:05:45.074 --> 02:05:48.945
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>upfront from the PE that effective date,
the value that it is,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/607-4
02:05:48.945 --> 02:05:52.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know leading questions that can then
form part of the FAQ.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/608-0
02:05:52.855 --> 02:05:57.084
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Queues and you're guiding them through
and it could be that actually the result</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/608-1
02:05:57.084 --> 02:06:00.785
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is. You can do this yourself,
but actually and then it or and then it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/608-2
02:06:00.785 --> 02:06:04.115
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>lands with yourself.
So that can be an upfront knowledge guide</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/608-3
02:06:04.115 --> 02:06:06.546
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>or FAQ guide to guide them in that
direction.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/608-4
02:06:06.546 --> 02:06:10.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>As you said that you often go back or you
can go back to and say you could have</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/608-5
02:06:10.775 --> 02:06:12.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>done this yourself in three.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/609-0
02:06:12.575 --> 02:06:16.868
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Continue the process so that query form
at the front end can be leading as well</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/609-1
02:06:16.868 --> 02:06:21.106
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as capturing a lot of the information,
but it's those pieces of information if</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/609-2
02:06:21.106 --> 02:06:24.701
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you can share with us or just say they
are mandatory that we need,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/609-3
02:06:24.701 --> 02:06:28.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we absolutely have to have them.
And then there's the others that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/610-0
02:06:29.255 --> 02:06:33.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We also need in order for our reporting
or our downstream processes. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/610-1
02:06:33.815 --> 02:06:37.767
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so that's how it lands with yourself.
Yeah. OK. Happy with that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/610-2
02:06:37.767 --> 02:06:42.448
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So then so now they've captured it and OK,
they're not going to do in three.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/610-3
02:06:42.448 --> 02:06:47.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It lands with yourself and you've got the
information. It's probably that next step.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/611-0
02:06:47.895 --> 02:06:51.713
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It lands with the team.
We could talk about auto assignment.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/611-1
02:06:51.713 --> 02:06:56.595
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We've discussed that and sensitivity
around that and then the person picks it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/611-2
02:06:56.595 --> 02:07:00.788
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>up. What do they do next?
What's the activities involved from your</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/611-3
02:07:00.788 --> 02:07:04.293
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>side? Yeah. Well,
the bit virtually either access a pro</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/611-4
02:07:04.293 --> 02:07:06.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>forma if one has been generated.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/613-0
02:07:07.815 --> 02:07:12.497
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Can I ask is it tends to be that you
would need a pro forma or is it all</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/613-1
02:07:12.497 --> 02:07:16.794
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>always should exist for them?
Is that a rule? No, they they don't.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/613-2
02:07:16.794 --> 02:07:21.989
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If they submit it through free then they
they they have to create a pro forma it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/613-3
02:07:21.989 --> 02:07:23.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>wouldn't be possible.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/614-0
02:07:24.615 --> 02:07:28.610
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>For e-mail requests coming in,
they don't have to have generated a pro</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/614-1
02:07:28.610 --> 02:07:33.111
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>forma, should they though? I mean it's a,
it is part of the process is what I'm</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/614-2
02:07:33.111 --> 02:07:35.643
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>saying.
It depends on all of it because they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/614-3
02:07:35.643 --> 02:07:39.806
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>could just know that, you know,
they've already agreed that this matters.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/614-4
02:07:39.806 --> 02:07:41.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Getting billed at X amount the how.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/615-0
02:07:42.575 --> 02:07:47.082
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>On the completion, so then they,
they wouldn't necessarily have to create</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/615-1
02:07:47.082 --> 02:07:52.197
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>a building guide because they might have,
they would just know how full details are</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/615-2
02:07:52.197 --> 02:07:55.180
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>correct.
So we would go in and just have a quick</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/615-3
02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:59.991
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>check. If there's no pro forma there,
we would a generate 1 and then go in and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/615-4
02:07:59.991 --> 02:08:00.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/616-0
02:08:01.535 --> 02:08:05.566
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Bell as pay instructions received.
Does it say which? There's an opportunity.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/616-1
02:08:05.566 --> 02:08:09.494
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I was thinking there's an opportunity
that was part of that leading leading</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/616-2
02:08:09.494 --> 02:08:13.524
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>questions that they do that for. I mean,
if they can do it and they can do it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/616-3
02:08:13.524 --> 02:08:16.728
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>rather than you do it,
it's a sort of an activity that is pre</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/616-4
02:08:16.728 --> 02:08:19.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing that should be in place is what
I'm saying.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/617-0
02:08:21.015 --> 02:08:24.681
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean, it's not important.
I'm just thinking that it could be part</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/617-1
02:08:24.681 --> 02:08:27.646
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of the knowledge transfer kind of like in
theory, yes,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/617-2
02:08:27.646 --> 02:08:31.958
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and probably for the more simple ones.
But I think sometimes for the comprehend</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/617-3
02:08:31.958 --> 02:08:34.976
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>on the request,
like trying to think an example without</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/617-4
02:08:34.976 --> 02:08:38.588
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>going into too much detail,
but see if there was maybe several pro</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/617-5
02:08:38.588 --> 02:08:39.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>formas on that same math.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/618-0
02:08:40.215 --> 02:08:42.972
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And there's some time on what sometimes
be included.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/618-1
02:08:42.972 --> 02:08:47.237
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It sometimes may be actually easier for
us to have control for doing the check at</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/618-2
02:08:47.237 --> 02:08:50.878
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the same time. Yeah, presumably.
And again, sometimes that's a thing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/618-3
02:08:50.878 --> 02:08:55.039
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's kind of like what we're saying about
if it's a simple request or a complex</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/618-4
02:08:55.039 --> 02:08:57.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>request,
the requester might not actually know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/619-0
02:08:58.175 --> 02:09:01.224
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>In that instance,
like it's how maybe did they interpret</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/619-1
02:09:01.224 --> 02:09:05.236
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that as a sample or complex request?
So I just I wouldn't want to fit them</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/619-2
02:09:05.236 --> 02:09:08.980
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>when you need to undo it. Yeah.
And you're checking it anyway because</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/619-3
02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:12.082
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you're even if you get them,
you're checking them anyway.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/619-4
02:09:12.082 --> 02:09:15.505
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Presumably you know. Well,
we still have to go into the perform</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/619-5
02:09:15.505 --> 02:09:16.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>access and perform app.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/620-0
02:09:17.375 --> 02:09:22.077
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>As the billing instructions or just check
is there any any details on the pro forma</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/620-1
02:09:22.077 --> 02:09:26.611
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that you absolutely need to progress or
without it and it's only something PE or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/620-2
02:09:26.611 --> 02:09:31.200
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>partner or someone else would know that
unless it's there I'm going to be able to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/620-3
02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:32.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>process your your bill as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/621-0
02:09:33.735 --> 02:09:37.129
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It sounds like the reverse,
that you don't get hardware.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/621-1
02:09:37.129 --> 02:09:41.653
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Maybe if it was a if it's an E billing
client and once you're in the proof,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/621-2
02:09:41.653 --> 02:09:46.653
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there's a sort of tick tick box in within
the pro forma for E billing clients which</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/621-3
02:09:46.653 --> 02:09:49.868
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is set up at matter level,
but the PE doesn't ticket,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/621-4
02:09:49.868 --> 02:09:51.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>which creates a pro forma.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/622-0
02:09:51.935 --> 02:09:56.235
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So our first sort of thing we do is check
that and if it's E billing,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/622-1
02:09:56.235 --> 02:10:01.149
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we would then go and check what the E
billing requirements are for that client,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/622-2
02:10:01.149 --> 02:10:04.159
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because they all vary.
I mean most often or not,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/622-3
02:10:04.159 --> 02:10:07.844
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they generally need a sort of P1 matter
ID, but not always.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/622-4
02:10:07.844 --> 02:10:10.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we'll go and check what they are.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/623-0
02:10:10.535 --> 02:10:12.801
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then check if they provided them to
us.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/623-1
02:10:12.801 --> 02:10:16.044
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So when you say day as in the PES or the
partners or the yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/623-2
02:10:16.044 --> 02:10:19.957
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>whoever's requested then voice. Yeah.
Is that something that we can capture</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/623-3
02:10:19.957 --> 02:10:24.179
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>upfront then in terms of the request to
make sure that that if we're not going to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/623-4
02:10:24.179 --> 02:10:26.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>do a consistent pro forma for everyone
then.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/624-0
02:10:27.135 --> 02:10:30.692
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>How do we ensure that we are getting the
right information that we need as</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/624-1
02:10:30.692 --> 02:10:34.058
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>absolutely essential if you want me to
process as quickly as possible,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/624-2
02:10:34.058 --> 02:10:37.804
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think we captured something because I
think in E billing I think I know on E</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/624-3
02:10:37.804 --> 02:10:40.459
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing on Monday they had the non PO and
PO there was,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/624-4
02:10:40.459 --> 02:10:44.252
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there was lots of that varieties that we
picked up that we can incorporate into</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/624-5
02:10:44.252 --> 02:10:46.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that that process as well that we saw on
Monday.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/625-0
02:10:46.855 --> 02:10:49.943
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And that differentiation,
what was captured at that level?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/625-1
02:10:49.943 --> 02:10:53.817
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think they went through all those PO
versions in E billing. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/625-2
02:10:53.817 --> 02:10:56.591
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There's a lot of things I think quite
often. I mean,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/625-3
02:10:56.591 --> 02:11:00.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they would probably said that themselves
that were the PS don't always know if the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/625-4
02:11:00.935 --> 02:11:02.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>client is to get E billed.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/626-0
02:11:02.735 --> 02:11:05.612
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And they don't know what the requirements
are.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/626-1
02:11:05.612 --> 02:11:09.651
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So and you always have them again trying
to push them through it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/626-2
02:11:09.651 --> 02:11:13.629
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>one fence and then it's you're like,
where's the PO or XY and Z?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/626-3
02:11:13.629 --> 02:11:17.852
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Whatever it is, they go and,
like quite often they might come in and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/626-4
02:11:17.852 --> 02:11:22.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>say they just want a front page invoice,
which should just, you know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/627-0
02:11:22.735 --> 02:11:28.191
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The basic invoice to the client,
but with no backup material but with some</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/627-1
02:11:28.191 --> 02:11:32.992
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of the E billing clients,
most of them that is a requirement that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/627-2
02:11:32.992 --> 02:11:37.866
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>has to be detailed breakdown.
So you have to go back and check and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/627-3
02:11:37.866 --> 02:11:39.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>again that as the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/628-0
02:11:39.655 --> 02:11:44.206
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Probably odd occasion where it has been
agreed or load set up as an E billing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/628-1
02:11:44.206 --> 02:11:48.057
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>client that this particular invoice
doesn't need to get E billed,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/628-2
02:11:48.057 --> 02:11:52.666
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so you have to get that they know that
it's an E billing client what they know</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/628-3
02:11:52.666 --> 02:11:56.283
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as part as it comes in.
I mean is it not that we could say so</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/628-4
02:11:56.283 --> 02:11:59.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>very recently we have added a field on
the NBI form.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/629-0
02:11:59.655 --> 02:12:02.706
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So technically going forward like since
six months,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/629-1
02:12:02.706 --> 02:12:05.345
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know whatever clients we have
onboarded,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/629-2
02:12:05.345 --> 02:12:08.161
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>yeah everybody should know because it's
ticked.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/629-3
02:12:08.161 --> 02:12:11.328
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's something we can capture up funds
to help you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/629-4
02:12:11.328 --> 02:12:14.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't think they usually do OK at the
minute, yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/630-0
02:12:15.135 --> 02:12:19.688
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>No. Yeah, now in September go live,
they might because what was a bit of a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/630-1
02:12:19.688 --> 02:12:23.633
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>pain that whether that the billing guides
that they do generate,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/630-2
02:12:23.633 --> 02:12:27.093
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they don't ever even mention if it's a
rebilling client.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/630-3
02:12:27.093 --> 02:12:31.463
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So there's nothing on there on that
information to tell them. Remember,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/630-4
02:12:31.463 --> 02:12:34.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's the track that's maybe something
that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/631-0
02:12:34.575 --> 02:12:37.594
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, I think it's it's.
It's still better than it used to be.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/631-1
02:12:37.594 --> 02:12:40.900
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. And because it also, I mean,
I'm covering E billing over here,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/631-2
02:12:40.900 --> 02:12:44.733
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it it triggers the E billing guys to
be on boarded on the clients portal as</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/631-3
02:12:44.733 --> 02:12:47.368
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>well. Yeah,
we did that on boarding process on Monday.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/631-4
02:12:47.368 --> 02:12:50.866
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, it's also a cumbersome process.
Yeah. A prerequisite for that. OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/631-5
02:12:50.866 --> 02:12:52.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so it's landed with you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/632-0
02:12:52.615 --> 02:12:56.419
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Check E billing.
We can capture that upfront and check</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/632-1
02:12:56.419 --> 02:13:02.228
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that the pro forma maybe there wasn't one,
but then you generate that billing guide</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/632-2
02:13:02.228 --> 02:13:07.000
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and that stays in three E,
correct all that that attachment stays in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/632-3
02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the system there?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/633-0
02:13:08.375 --> 02:13:12.487
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is that correct? Yeah. Well, it's always.
Yeah, it's always on three.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/633-1
02:13:12.487 --> 02:13:17.304
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But if it's if it's not submitted yet,
it's still a three, like, you know, proof.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/633-2
02:13:17.304 --> 02:13:20.417
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, the bill.
If they've provided a billing guide,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/633-3
02:13:20.417 --> 02:13:23.706
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's but the billing guide doesn't look
saved on three.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/633-4
02:13:23.706 --> 02:13:27.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's just attached to the request that
they've sent to us. But the one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/634-0
02:13:28.055 --> 02:13:32.437
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That you then generate,
it stays on three E is that where there's?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/634-1
02:13:32.437 --> 02:13:37.864
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I'm trying the billing guide wouldn't
stay is where they're stored currently or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/634-2
02:13:37.864 --> 02:13:43.096
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>no if if they submitted a request through
3 E they've got an option on that for</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/634-3
02:13:43.096 --> 02:13:47.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>attachments and if if they included a
billing guide with that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/635-0
02:13:47.935 --> 02:13:52.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Submitted request,
it would be saved on that pro forma on 3E,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/635-1
02:13:52.255 --> 02:13:57.549
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but if it's a request through share,
well designed it the and that building</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/635-2
02:13:57.549 --> 02:14:02.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>guys provided it's just attached to that
share well ticket and that's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/636-0
02:14:03.135 --> 02:14:05.515
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>When do they get stored?
I mean in Cherwell today,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/636-1
02:14:05.515 --> 02:14:08.547
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but you they would just remain.
I'm just thinking that if you're</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/636-2
02:14:08.547 --> 02:14:11.952
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>generating it where they get stored, well,
if we generate the pro forma,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/636-3
02:14:11.952 --> 02:14:15.684
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we don't create a billing guide or just
generate and you would actually because</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/636-4
02:14:15.684 --> 02:14:19.043
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we have to get into the issue. Then boys,
you have to have a pro forma,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/636-5
02:14:19.043 --> 02:14:19.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's where you're.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/637-0
02:14:20.455 --> 02:14:23.239
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know,
OK and then you attach it back to show</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/637-1
02:14:23.239 --> 02:14:27.556
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>all that ticket is that what you're
saying that it's what you we would then</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/637-2
02:14:27.556 --> 02:14:31.759
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>go back on share what share will reply
back and attach the invoice to the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/637-3
02:14:31.759 --> 02:14:34.542
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>request.
I can't say share invoice so that would</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/637-4
02:14:34.542 --> 02:14:38.064
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>be then in service.
Now as you're supporting everything yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/637-5
02:14:38.064 --> 02:14:38.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK great.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/638-0
02:14:39.135 --> 02:14:43.379
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK, next cheques. What else you do?
We would then. I mean,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/638-1
02:14:43.379 --> 02:14:47.911
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we've quite a few check.
We've got some automatic cheques just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/638-2
02:14:47.911 --> 02:14:52.658
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>within the system of just because three
sometimes go a bit funky,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/638-3
02:14:52.658 --> 02:14:55.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>making sure that the actual client.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/639-0
02:14:56.455 --> 02:15:01.424
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But the the matter's been opened under
has the right client details address</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/639-1
02:15:01.424 --> 02:15:04.627
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>details.
It's not pulled through the how I think</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/639-2
02:15:04.627 --> 02:15:08.354
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Monday we said are they active you know?
Are they? Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/639-3
02:15:08.354 --> 02:15:11.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>All those things like that we'll check
that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/640-0
02:15:12.615 --> 02:15:16.050
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Other things we wouldn't necessarily
check these,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/640-1
02:15:16.050 --> 02:15:21.407
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but what some of them a instance if
there's like phases and tasks set up on a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/640-2
02:15:21.407 --> 02:15:24.841
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>matter,
then once they've set up a phase all time</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/640-3
02:15:24.841 --> 02:15:29.511
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>on that matter has to have.
But one of those scenarios they are but</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/640-4
02:15:29.511 --> 02:15:30.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>quite often.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/641-0
02:15:30.855 --> 02:15:36.286
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The only apply they'll set it up and
they'll apply to some time and allows</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/641-1
02:15:36.286 --> 02:15:39.834
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>them to.
It also allows them to create a billing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/641-2
02:15:39.834 --> 02:15:45.192
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>guide and and create a pro forma anyway,
but once it comes to us to bill,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/641-3
02:15:45.192 --> 02:15:48.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we then get an error message and until.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/642-0
02:15:48.335 --> 02:15:53.067
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Until the other entries that haven't yet
had a task assigned to them are completed,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/642-1
02:15:53.067 --> 02:15:57.854
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we can't move forward, but a formal check.
So what I'm saying is that a formal check</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/642-2
02:15:57.854 --> 02:16:00.670
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's more like we could formalise that
checklist.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/642-3
02:16:00.670 --> 02:16:04.950
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know that you have so that when
you're in that ticket, you're checking,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/642-4
02:16:04.950 --> 02:16:07.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know, the pro formal,
you're checking the deeds.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/643-0
02:16:08.575 --> 02:16:12.334
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. You know, just so that they're OK.
So you don't want it to be this long list</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/643-1
02:16:12.334 --> 02:16:15.368
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because you probably do 50,
but it's just this overall check that,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/643-2
02:16:15.368 --> 02:16:19.036
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know, if you're working on something,
you can always say, oh gosh, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/643-3
02:16:19.036 --> 02:16:22.160
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what was that or if it's reassigned,
you know, needs help from your,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/643-4
02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:22.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they know exactly.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/644-0
02:16:23.415 --> 02:16:27.209
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The last bit to check or you know it
could be handed over for whatever reason.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/644-1
02:16:27.209 --> 02:16:30.379
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's just that ability.
I know that you tend to be working in one</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/644-2
02:16:30.379 --> 02:16:33.837
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ticket. It's just easier. I mean,
we do have an automatic internal team</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/644-3
02:16:33.837 --> 02:16:37.487
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>cheques for older players, I think.
I'm sorry, I'm getting who is the next?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/644-4
02:16:37.487 --> 02:16:38.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Well, we wouldn't sort of.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/645-0
02:16:39.335 --> 02:16:44.102
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You wouldn't reassign it to someone and
say, could you finish it off? I mean,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/645-1
02:16:44.102 --> 02:16:48.991
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there might be an odd time you have to
because it's quite a complex one and you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/645-2
02:16:48.991 --> 02:16:52.597
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>know you're off,
but the cheques sort of automatic cheques</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/645-3
02:16:52.597 --> 02:16:54.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>anyway. So the assumption would be.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/646-0
02:16:55.255 --> 02:16:58.499
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>To be quite honest, if you'd signed it,
if I signed a ticket,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/646-1
02:16:58.499 --> 02:17:02.892
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then to Louise that I was halfway through,
she might automatically do those cheques</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/646-2
02:17:02.892 --> 02:17:05.299
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just on now because you do it.
But she would,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/646-3
02:17:05.299 --> 02:17:08.489
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>our assumption should be that I've
already done them anyway.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/646-4
02:17:08.489 --> 02:17:12.569
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If I've already been working on it,
I suppose I'm just capturing the types of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/646-5
02:17:12.569 --> 02:17:14.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>activities that you do, you know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/648-0
02:17:14.735 --> 02:17:17.213
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They could just be a ham.
You don't want to check.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/648-1
02:17:17.213 --> 02:17:20.177
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You don't want to check box for checked
address. Check mail.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/648-2
02:17:20.177 --> 02:17:23.966
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know you don't want hundreds of,
but it's just an overall that the person</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/648-3
02:17:23.966 --> 02:17:27.755
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>working on the ticket has done these
cheques three or four of them as part of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/648-4
02:17:27.755 --> 02:17:29.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the as part of the overall process.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/649-0
02:17:29.815 --> 02:17:34.347
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then you would have that live check
because I think you call them live check</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/649-1
02:17:34.347 --> 02:17:37.144
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and you do that on everything or a
certain value.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/649-2
02:17:37.144 --> 02:17:40.893
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Have you guys got any live cheques set up
like business assurance,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/649-3
02:17:40.893 --> 02:17:45.480
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's the ones we just do think children
back on that because we only do them on</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/649-4
02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:46.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the action list.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/650-0
02:17:47.375 --> 02:17:51.616
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And it doesn't. She does that in bulk.
Does she? Is that? Is that the she does?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/650-1
02:17:51.616 --> 02:17:55.644
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm getting mixed up now. The live check.
There's there's a sample cheques.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/650-2
02:17:55.644 --> 02:17:58.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is it my team? She does.
Is that the sample ones?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/650-3
02:17:58.295 --> 02:18:02.376
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They do the live cheques we do within the
team. Yeah. Take that away. Right.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/650-4
02:18:02.376 --> 02:18:05.662
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'll double check.
Exactly live cheques from the perspective.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/650-5
02:18:05.662 --> 02:18:06.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think. What you're.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/651-0
02:18:07.015 --> 02:18:11.393
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Into the areas though it's like a self
check rather than somebody passing it on.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/651-1
02:18:11.393 --> 02:18:14.041
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, we just got.
That's our automatic process.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/651-2
02:18:14.041 --> 02:18:18.365
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Like when we go when it's just check now
as a client name and put an address it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/651-3
02:18:18.365 --> 02:18:20.851
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>should be.
But we just have additions when it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/651-4
02:18:20.851 --> 02:18:23.607
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>doesn't.
So we automatically create a process that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/651-5
02:18:23.607 --> 02:18:26.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the bats pulling through correctly you
know the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/652-0
02:18:26.975 --> 02:18:29.779
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, all that,
it's just it's some basic cheques that we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/652-1
02:18:29.779 --> 02:18:33.452
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just kind of just like an overall kind of
sense check rather than it being,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/652-2
02:18:33.452 --> 02:18:35.868
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it probably actually touched upon
that, that,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/652-3
02:18:35.868 --> 02:18:39.058
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that you know they're mandatory,
I mean the fact that that may be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/652-4
02:18:39.058 --> 02:18:42.054
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>addressed, you know,
for compliance and regulatory issue, OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/652-5
02:18:42.054 --> 02:18:44.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it might have been the wrong address and
it impacts.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/653-0
02:18:45.015 --> 02:18:49.417
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But the VAT has to be has to be correct.
Yeah. The VAT number has to be correct.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/653-1
02:18:49.417 --> 02:18:52.134
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know,
there's some things that are regulatory</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/653-2
02:18:52.134 --> 02:18:55.394
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as opposed to, OK,
the address might be slightly off by you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/653-3
02:18:55.394 --> 02:18:59.687
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>know number of building or whatever.
But there are some fields as you say that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/653-4
02:18:59.687 --> 02:19:02.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>are probably good to check.
You check the vats.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/654-0
02:19:02.815 --> 02:19:05.913
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Checked the amount,
checked the and the check the client D</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/654-1
02:19:05.913 --> 02:19:10.164
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know onboarding details, address,
etcetera. We'll see the check the address,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/654-2
02:19:10.164 --> 02:19:14.154
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's not checked because we wouldn't know
if the address is correct or not.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/654-3
02:19:14.154 --> 02:19:17.408
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But you've looked at it,
the address exists all we're sort of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/654-4
02:19:17.408 --> 02:19:19.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>checking is that the the actual client.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/655-0
02:19:20.255 --> 02:19:24.624
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Name for that matter,
that's been opened under that the client</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/655-1
02:19:24.624 --> 02:19:30.102
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>name is pulling through onto that address.
The actual sort of country of that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/655-2
02:19:30.102 --> 02:19:35.511
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we've got that that we know that the
VAT again the sort of two tax area is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/655-3
02:19:35.511 --> 02:19:36.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>matching.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/656-0
02:19:37.615 --> 02:19:41.767
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Clients address that's pulled through
just because we'd or do we glitches in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/656-1
02:19:41.767 --> 02:19:45.972
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the past where it went a bit wrong.
So it's being correct is pulling through,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/656-2
02:19:45.972 --> 02:19:48.506
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>yeah.
So maybe we could formalise some of that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/656-3
02:19:48.506 --> 02:19:52.981
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>checklist and then signed it off and then
so no live check at that point it's just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/656-4
02:19:52.981 --> 02:19:54.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>self checking and then you close the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/657-0
02:19:55.415 --> 02:19:59.625
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Close the ticket. Is that correct?
Or is it any other approvals or anything</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/657-1
02:19:59.625 --> 02:20:02.339
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>else you need to do to it? We don't.
Not really.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/657-2
02:20:02.339 --> 02:20:05.219
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The approval is required for us.
Somebody you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/657-3
02:20:05.219 --> 02:20:07.932
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>if you're asking for an invoice,
you'll get one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/657-4
02:20:07.932 --> 02:20:12.308
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If it's all the information there and
it's ready to be billed where we have to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/657-5
02:20:12.308 --> 02:20:14.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>go back sometimes, as you know,
with queries.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/658-0
02:20:14.935 --> 02:20:18.921
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If it is the E billing and if not gives
the correct information,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/658-1
02:20:18.921 --> 02:20:23.825
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>or if they've came back and said that
that we want a different address and it's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/658-2
02:20:23.825 --> 02:20:26.891
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>not set up,
or they want the rates changed again,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/658-3
02:20:26.891 --> 02:20:31.489
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we need forward to rates team or yeah,
we captured lots of that yesterday.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/658-4
02:20:31.489 --> 02:20:34.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We want some funds applied to it if
there's funds.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/659-0
02:20:34.695 --> 02:20:38.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Client funds set and they might want it
settled in full and part paid.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/659-1
02:20:38.695 --> 02:20:43.315
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think that probably comes to the next
stage not to cut you off is the fact that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/659-2
02:20:43.315 --> 02:20:46.808
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>if there was no activity,
so you've gone through the cheques.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/659-3
02:20:46.808 --> 02:20:49.456
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's all good. Yes,
you would then just close.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/659-4
02:20:49.456 --> 02:20:53.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I suppose I'm just coming up to that.
Have you then close complete it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/660-0
02:20:54.415 --> 02:20:58.813
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then the requester knows that the
invoice has been generated in 3E.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/660-1
02:20:58.813 --> 02:21:03.089
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So if we're notifying them back,
the request said PE from ServiceNow,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/660-2
02:21:03.089 --> 02:21:08.097
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they get that notification that it's been
done and if the and is then the invoice</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/660-3
02:21:08.097 --> 02:21:12.128
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>for them presented in 3E.
Is that where it gets generated it was,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/660-4
02:21:12.128 --> 02:21:13.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it isn't, it's generated.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/661-0
02:21:13.815 --> 02:21:17.885
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Three and saved in three,
but we send them APDF copy of it so they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/661-1
02:21:17.885 --> 02:21:22.258
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>wouldn't go to free to find it.
Could it be rather than attaching it to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/661-2
02:21:22.258 --> 02:21:25.902
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>service that you know because it it's
being mastered in 3E?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/661-3
02:21:25.902 --> 02:21:30.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The notification would say your invoice
is available in three E to view.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/662-0
02:21:30.935 --> 02:21:34.157
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>No,
they would go for a rocker to be honest.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/662-1
02:21:34.157 --> 02:21:38.094
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If we went,
if we were telling them to go and find it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/662-2
02:21:38.094 --> 02:21:43.034
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we we give them invoice. Yep. OK.
And again we're also if it is an E</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/662-3
02:21:43.034 --> 02:21:49.047
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing is another example of what was an
E billing one when we send it back to the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/662-4
02:21:49.047 --> 02:21:50.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>PE, we would also.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/663-0
02:21:51.015 --> 02:21:53.121
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean,
I think again with the upgrading 3,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/663-1
02:21:53.121 --> 02:21:56.900
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's probably going to change a bit,
but at the moment we will copy in the E</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/663-2
02:21:56.900 --> 02:22:00.106
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing team so that they've got,
they know that they can now, OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/663-3
02:22:00.106 --> 02:22:03.311
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so if they're billing you,
they would then be notified so that all</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/663-4
02:22:03.311 --> 02:22:06.373
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>could be they could be automatically
notified at the same time,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/663-5
02:22:06.373 --> 02:22:09.722
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just go back to that PDF because I'm
conscious of things being in two</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/663-6
02:22:09.722 --> 02:22:10.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>different places.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/664-0
02:22:11.335 --> 02:22:14.646
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>In order to notify them so when you press
close complete,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/664-1
02:22:14.646 --> 02:22:19.268
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it doesn't have to be the actual invoice.
It could be a thumbnail or it could be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/664-2
02:22:19.268 --> 02:22:22.122
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>APDF because it's being it's in three E
isn't it?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/664-3
02:22:22.122 --> 02:22:24.919
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But they could have a thumbnail of that
invoice.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/664-4
02:22:24.919 --> 02:22:28.971
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Or what do the PS then do with that?
That's for their information only</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/664-5
02:22:28.971 --> 02:22:29.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>essentially.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/665-0
02:22:30.175 --> 02:22:34.069
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So that's their invoice.
So if they then send it to the client,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/665-1
02:22:34.069 --> 02:22:36.989
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think they probably send them most by
e-mail.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/665-2
02:22:36.989 --> 02:22:41.308
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They e-mail the client with a cop that
PDF. So that's the actual copy.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/665-3
02:22:41.308 --> 02:22:46.418
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So you've taken it from three attachment
to notification and then they get send it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/665-4
02:22:46.418 --> 02:22:47.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK yeah, that's good.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/666-0
02:22:50.775 --> 02:22:54.913
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then that was the three steps.
So you get it. It's work in progress.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/666-1
02:22:54.913 --> 02:22:58.200
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Close. I'm aware.
Then lots of stories that you just said</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/666-2
02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:01.941
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is that you might have to reverse it.
You might have to split it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/666-3
02:23:01.941 --> 02:23:06.589
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You might have to send it to rates and
maths. You know, there were lots in there.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/666-4
02:23:06.589 --> 02:23:08.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Maybe I can just grab a few.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/667-0
02:23:08.575 --> 02:23:11.319
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean,
I think these are mainly reversals</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/667-1
02:23:11.319 --> 02:23:16.359
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>actually, yeah, there was a cancellation,
I mean that might be a good you know</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/667-2
02:23:16.359 --> 02:23:20.888
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's a good one to close off.
So that when you cancel the invoice so</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/667-3
02:23:20.888 --> 02:23:26.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you're working on it during those cheques.
What sort of reasons do you have for?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/668-0
02:23:26.655 --> 02:23:30.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Cancel or what comes up often?
Why you have to cancel them?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/668-1
02:23:30.255 --> 02:23:34.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Or are they requesting to cancel it?
Or if it comes as part of your cheques</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/668-2
02:23:34.815 --> 02:23:37.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and what you're finding that you cancel
it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/668-3
02:23:37.455 --> 02:23:40.515
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is that who that triggers that we would
generally,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/668-4
02:23:40.515 --> 02:23:45.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean we could cancel and we we would
maybe cancel an invoice during that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/668-5
02:23:45.015 --> 02:23:45.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>process if we.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/669-0
02:23:46.935 --> 02:23:50.317
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Serialised, oh,
a pit bell and I forgot to change the fee</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/669-1
02:23:50.317 --> 02:23:54.981
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>amount, so as soon as you've done it,
we would quickly reverse it and that's an</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/669-2
02:23:54.981 --> 02:23:58.362
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>error of an active. Yeah. Yeah,
that's just internal one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/669-3
02:23:58.362 --> 02:24:01.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But actual requests for reversals would
generally.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/670-0
02:24:02.335 --> 02:24:07.636
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We generally always come from for
cancellations tends to be something</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/670-1
02:24:07.636 --> 02:24:11.649
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>internal,
but and then requests for reversals. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/670-2
02:24:11.649 --> 02:24:16.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it could be like now,
can you cancel this invoice in the issue?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/671-0
02:24:17.295 --> 02:24:21.365
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Occasionally,
just with a new date because they haven't</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/671-1
02:24:21.365 --> 02:24:25.216
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>sent it out,
or they've decided to uplift the fees a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/671-2
02:24:25.216 --> 02:24:29.721
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>bit more or reduce the fees, or XY or Z.
OK, so cancellation.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/671-3
02:24:29.721 --> 02:24:33.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean there's two terminologies and it
almost cancel is.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/672-0
02:24:34.695 --> 02:24:38.514
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>No act no further action.
We've taken it off the the queue where</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/672-1
02:24:38.514 --> 02:24:43.038
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's reversal might be there needs to be
some activity because of a mount or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/672-2
02:24:43.038 --> 02:24:45.740
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>something,
but it still could have subsequent</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/672-3
02:24:45.740 --> 02:24:48.208
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>activities.
I mean you'll have cancel and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/672-4
02:24:48.208 --> 02:24:49.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>cancellations back to WEP.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/673-0
02:24:50.175 --> 02:24:53.362
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You might have a cancellation where
they've decided,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/673-1
02:24:53.362 --> 02:24:58.352
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>actually we're just writing off all the
time or you've got, then you've cancelled.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/673-2
02:24:58.352 --> 02:25:01.779
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And at the issue with new instructions
that might be it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/673-3
02:25:01.779 --> 02:25:06.589
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they've realised they build the wrong
entity and they've opened a new matter or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/673-4
02:25:06.589 --> 02:25:09.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we now need a third party here,
so many different.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/674-0
02:25:09.695 --> 02:25:12.904
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Scenarios, but yeah,
I would say as well like in in terms of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/674-1
02:25:12.904 --> 02:25:15.797
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>like cancellation and reissue in terms of
terminology,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/674-2
02:25:15.797 --> 02:25:18.322
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they probably use them kind of
interchangeable.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/674-3
02:25:18.322 --> 02:25:22.478
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So they might say cancel an invoice,
but what they mean is for us to go in and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/674-4
02:25:22.478 --> 02:25:25.634
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>reverse it. Yeah,
and that that's what we are trying to get</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/674-5
02:25:25.634 --> 02:25:28.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to that term is that they are as kind of
separate council is.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/675-0
02:25:29.455 --> 02:25:34.366
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know error might be error related or
for other as a cancellation back to whip.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/675-1
02:25:34.366 --> 02:25:38.567
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know you could get that root cause
but reversal is another subset.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/675-2
02:25:38.567 --> 02:25:42.886
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Another activity presumably get.
So we don't want they don't want in the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/675-3
02:25:42.886 --> 02:25:45.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>same it's the same same you have to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/676-0
02:25:45.535 --> 02:25:51.547
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You have to cancel or reverse whatever
terminology you need to actually reverse</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/676-1
02:25:51.547 --> 02:25:54.928
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that invoice,
and when you first reverse it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/676-2
02:25:54.928 --> 02:25:58.986
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's all reverse back to pro forma status
right away,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/676-3
02:25:58.986 --> 02:26:01.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>which should then either go in and.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/677-0
02:26:02.175 --> 02:26:06.983
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Depending, or if it's a different amount,
just rework on that pro forma or you make</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/677-1
02:26:06.983 --> 02:26:11.160
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that pro forma dormant and the time
either goes back to WIPP or you then</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/677-2
02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:15.109
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>generate a new one and transfer,
you know whatever they want you to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/677-3
02:26:15.109 --> 02:26:19.515
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And I think we will put in this kind of
categorise some of those those ways.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/677-4
02:26:19.515 --> 02:26:21.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we can then differentiate it for.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/678-0
02:26:21.615 --> 02:26:25.247
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If you're submitting it and yeah,
so I've got reverse pro forma reverse</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/678-1
02:26:25.247 --> 02:26:28.424
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>back to whip reverse.
You know we if it's that's the status of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/678-2
02:26:28.424 --> 02:26:32.560
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it or the action that is on that invoice
we could categorise that activity. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/678-3
02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:36.342
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's more about the outcome of what they
want from that request coming in.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/678-4
02:26:36.342 --> 02:26:37.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So that when you capture that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/680-0
02:26:38.335 --> 02:26:42.154
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah,
because I think we've got quite a few.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/680-1
02:26:42.154 --> 02:26:47.671
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think if you hit on the initial view
reversal seem to take up,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/680-2
02:26:47.671 --> 02:26:54.630
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we could then categorise those of you
know and then the actions that come out</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/680-3
02:26:54.630 --> 02:26:57.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of them and then do they come.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/681-0
02:26:57.615 --> 02:27:01.643
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Just to finalise that they could be off
your queue so intro will say when you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/681-1
02:27:01.643 --> 02:27:05.722
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>happen are they effectively considered
closed complete and then so a new query</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/681-2
02:27:05.722 --> 02:27:09.904
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>comes in or on the back of that you're
kept it open and you'll you'll follow the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/681-3
02:27:09.904 --> 02:27:12.228
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>loop.
So if it goes back to WIPT that's been</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/681-4
02:27:12.228 --> 02:27:13.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>reassigned that's gone.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/682-0
02:27:14.095 --> 02:27:19.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Back to performer is that that's also off
your queue or you're waiting for a new</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/682-1
02:27:19.095 --> 02:27:21.749
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>one.
It will come pin because sometime the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/682-2
02:27:21.749 --> 02:27:26.564
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just that they will see can you have just
reversed that back to pro forma and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/682-3
02:27:26.564 --> 02:27:31.440
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they're obviously just going to go and
rework on it if that's all they've told</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/682-4
02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:33.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>us to do, we would close it off.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/683-0
02:27:34.535 --> 02:27:38.572
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The will at times say.
Can you reverse that invoice?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/683-1
02:27:38.572 --> 02:27:44.590
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Someone I'm in the process of getting a
new matter opens or or they might say.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/683-2
02:27:44.590 --> 02:27:48.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Can you reverse this invoice and reissue
on matter XYZ?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/684-0
02:27:48.935 --> 02:27:52.090
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And we'll go to process process and then
as we get through,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/684-1
02:27:52.090 --> 02:27:56.244
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we'll notice that the matter's not fully
opened yet. It's maybe still pending.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/684-2
02:27:56.244 --> 02:27:59.978
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we would probably keep that open.
We would go back to them and say,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/684-3
02:27:59.978 --> 02:28:03.711
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know, we've reversed it.
We've transferred the time you're matters</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/684-4
02:28:03.711 --> 02:28:04.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>pending, let us know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/685-0
02:28:05.375 --> 02:28:09.087
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know, once it's completed,
then we'll so you can put your invoice.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/685-1
02:28:09.087 --> 02:28:13.217
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>At that stage you can put that on hold.
Maybe you know it's a reversal on hold</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/685-2
02:28:13.217 --> 02:28:15.674
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>reason why so it's not ticking off your
queue.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/685-3
02:28:15.674 --> 02:28:19.647
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So you can say actually we're waiting
awaiting further you know and you can</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/685-4
02:28:19.647 --> 02:28:23.881
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>have those on that OK and just to sign
off that so and then when you take it off</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/685-5
02:28:23.881 --> 02:28:25.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>on hold, how do you get?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/686-0
02:28:25.215 --> 02:28:28.246
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Inferred.
Are you watching it or would be you get</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/686-1
02:28:28.246 --> 02:28:33.155
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>sort of like journals like any you'd if
it's the tickets for you and then once a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/686-2
02:28:33.155 --> 02:28:38.125
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>new e-mail comes in, an update on that,
let them come in saying that's the matter</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/686-3
02:28:38.125 --> 02:28:40.671
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>opened.
It would appear then whoever it's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/686-4
02:28:40.671 --> 02:28:45.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>assigned to is like unread journals and
you go in and check them and go.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/687-0
02:28:45.335 --> 02:28:48.781
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Oh, that's then come back.
So you could have that on the input we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/687-1
02:28:48.781 --> 02:28:52.958
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>saw yesterday on the employee board for
the requester because they're not going</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/687-2
02:28:52.958 --> 02:28:55.778
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to get emails.
They'll have their and they can send a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/687-3
02:28:55.778 --> 02:28:59.485
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>note to you to say this is done and they
can take off, taken off hold,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/687-4
02:28:59.485 --> 02:29:02.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>trying to think about the white
terminology then.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/688-0
02:29:02.775 --> 02:29:07.436
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then processed and then you go
through the that checklist again and then</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/688-1
02:29:07.436 --> 02:29:11.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>presumably go through that check address
and then close complete. Yes. OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/688-2
02:29:11.975 --> 02:29:16.877
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we can capture those reversals and who
they're assigned to or closed off your</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/688-3
02:29:16.877 --> 02:29:19.843
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>queue,
all on hold awaiting further instructions</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/688-4
02:29:19.843 --> 02:29:21.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and then close complete.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/689-0
02:29:22.055 --> 02:29:24.993
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, that's good.
Any other scenarios are there,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/689-1
02:29:24.993 --> 02:29:29.105
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they're probably always a pain .
1 that you think anything one's your</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/689-2
02:29:29.105 --> 02:29:32.630
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>order. One's certainly is.
That can't see that. Oh, no. OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/689-3
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:36.625
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>if you just scroll to the top,
then we're just on reversals just to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/689-4
02:29:36.625 --> 02:29:40.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>close out. If you go a bit further up,
I think there's a handful. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/690-0
02:29:41.375 --> 02:29:44.930
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So there's cancellation,
we talked about invoice reissue,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/690-1
02:29:44.930 --> 02:29:49.711
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know that could be captured as a
category reissue with financial you know</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/690-2
02:29:49.711 --> 02:29:54.186
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they are you start as you start to test
them against the categorization,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/690-3
02:29:54.186 --> 02:29:57.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they come in with the.
I mean most of them we almost.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/691-0
02:29:57.935 --> 02:30:02.035
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Really now class them almost as that.
This you you know the same.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/691-1
02:30:02.035 --> 02:30:05.762
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's a cancellation regardless of what's
happening with it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/691-2
02:30:05.762 --> 02:30:08.992
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We're cancelling that invoice. I mean,
Louise does,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/691-3
02:30:08.992 --> 02:30:13.650
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't know if it's on there yet,
you but you did your Goldman Sachs sort</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/691-4
02:30:13.650 --> 02:30:15.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of accredits which are sort of.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/692-0
02:30:16.775 --> 02:30:19.951
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They're a kind of whole other. I'm not.
I don't know what?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/692-1
02:30:19.951 --> 02:30:23.449
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That they're very complex.
Whole other issue that probably comes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/692-2
02:30:23.449 --> 02:30:26.679
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>into complex. Yeah,
which I've realised there's a whole new</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/692-3
02:30:26.679 --> 02:30:29.531
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>science. There's lots more to come.
Rates of matter.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/692-4
02:30:29.531 --> 02:30:31.900
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yesterday I had rates of matter in my
head.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/692-5
02:30:31.900 --> 02:30:34.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Like I thought there's always the next
layer.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/693-0
02:30:36.535 --> 02:30:40.964
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK, that's good.
Maybe you just Scroll down for me to just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/693-1
02:30:40.964 --> 02:30:46.369
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think so we're at the whip, nice,
happy path and then you've got some</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/693-2
02:30:46.369 --> 02:30:49.972
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>further actions. I think there was split,
Bill,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/693-3
02:30:49.972 --> 02:30:54.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>does that also happen maybe you touch on
that phases and tasks?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/694-0
02:30:54.935 --> 02:30:57.434
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think have come up if that's another
action,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/694-1
02:30:57.434 --> 02:31:01.898
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know what we're trying to probably do
is standardise these workflows to capture</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/694-2
02:31:01.898 --> 02:31:05.406
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>scenarios and it could be not that you
have to then go Oh my God,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/694-3
02:31:05.406 --> 02:31:08.702
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's not a split bill. I don't have to.
But if you select it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/694-4
02:31:08.702 --> 02:31:12.795
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there's a subsequent task that you might
have to do and you're capturing the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/694-5
02:31:12.795 --> 02:31:14.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>metrics on those or the actions.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/695-0
02:31:14.575 --> 02:31:18.063
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That need to happen.
So should we talk about Split Bill,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/695-1
02:31:18.063 --> 02:31:21.245
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is that the next? Are they? Yeah.
So how does that,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/695-2
02:31:21.245 --> 02:31:24.671
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean that literally is probably as it
says, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/695-3
02:31:24.671 --> 02:31:29.321
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's the fact that had has the PE found
it or is it something that you find</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/695-4
02:31:29.321 --> 02:31:30.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>during your.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/696-0
02:31:30.455 --> 02:31:35.498
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Will it come as a split bill query? Yeah,
yeah, the request. So yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/696-1
02:31:35.498 --> 02:31:39.676
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it would come in.
It's not an action that you find on the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/696-2
02:31:39.676 --> 02:31:44.790
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>back of something. No. Right. OK.
They they would just send the belt a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/696-3
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:48.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>request in.
And generally all time will be on.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/697-0
02:31:48.935 --> 02:31:53.788
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>In most instances on one matter,
but it needs to be split between in most</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/697-1
02:31:53.788 --> 02:31:58.707
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>cases. It's probably a Co client request,
so I think we had primary matter</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/697-2
02:31:58.707 --> 02:32:04.018
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>yesterday and and there was like zinc
unlink. That's a wee bit different. Again.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/697-3
02:32:04.018 --> 02:32:08.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Now that's different that the primary
secondary ones know this.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/698-0
02:32:08.255 --> 02:32:17.109
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Split ones away all the times recorded,
but it's been my eyes have lit up already.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/698-1
02:32:17.109 --> 02:32:22.442
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Oh my God.
I can feel my teeth falling out or too</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/698-2
02:32:22.442 --> 02:32:22.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/699-0
02:32:24.295 --> 02:32:27.870
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's to get split between say
different core clients.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/699-1
02:32:27.870 --> 02:32:31.757
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we then need to what transfer sort of
percentage it could,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/699-2
02:32:31.757 --> 02:32:36.711
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean it could be 5050 or it could be,
but the instructions come from the PA,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/699-3
02:32:36.711 --> 02:32:40.347
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>yeah, they'll come.
They have to play because we wouldn't</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/699-4
02:32:40.347 --> 02:32:42.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>know. Yeah, we wouldn't know as long as.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/700-0
02:32:43.055 --> 02:32:45.833
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Everything's all set up and we then need
to what?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/700-1
02:32:45.833 --> 02:32:50.277
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Transfer X amount of values of WEP and we
usually need to click create a manual</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/700-2
02:32:50.277 --> 02:32:52.999
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>breakdown matter is that a matter level
they do?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/700-3
02:32:52.999 --> 02:32:57.387
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean do they do that at matter level?
Is that right or where do they do that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/700-4
02:32:57.387 --> 02:33:01.442
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>split where they send you know?
So if I was getting them to fill in that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/700-5
02:33:01.442 --> 02:33:02.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>request up it's a split.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/701-0
02:33:02.895 --> 02:33:05.846
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Bill,
what information do they need to give you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/701-1
02:33:05.846 --> 02:33:09.042
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the matter number and the matter? Yeah,
the matter,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/701-2
02:33:09.042 --> 02:33:13.405
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the matter who it's getting split with
and and on what and what basis,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/701-3
02:33:13.405 --> 02:33:18.199
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know it might be they might say it's
a 50% share between them or it could</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/701-4
02:33:18.199 --> 02:33:22.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>between four different clients and one
could have 50 percent 120.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/702-0
02:33:22.615 --> 02:33:26.428
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It can vary.
Now just depends on what the agreement is.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/702-1
02:33:26.428 --> 02:33:30.378
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It could be 1:00 to 1:00,
so it could be one client 5050.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/702-2
02:33:30.378 --> 02:33:35.893
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They could add the next next client 70.
Yeah. It doesn't matter. Yeah. Yeah. OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/702-3
02:33:35.893 --> 02:33:38.820
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK.
But we can give that that ability that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/702-4
02:33:38.820 --> 02:33:41.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they can add further instructions.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/703-0
02:33:41.495 --> 02:33:45.291
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>In that and they would give you the
matter. Do you like to have the number?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/703-1
02:33:45.291 --> 02:33:47.988
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think yesterday I think, oh, yeah,
that's a number.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/703-2
02:33:47.988 --> 02:33:50.684
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But it's so nice to have that. Four,
three, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/703-3
02:33:50.684 --> 02:33:54.829
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>actually have the details rather than us
rather than you, the team trying to find.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/703-4
02:33:54.829 --> 02:33:58.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's quite handy. I mean,
quite often the world, but it's handy.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/704-0
02:33:58.615 --> 02:34:00.915
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Also,
just if they give a little bit more</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/704-1
02:34:00.915 --> 02:34:05.240
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>information about the matter number just
because all one matter numbers are so</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/704-2
02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:07.812
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>similar,
which I think the four three you know</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/704-3
02:34:07.812 --> 02:34:11.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's 1000. Yeah, exactly.
It's so easy to make. We can validate it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/704-4
02:34:11.535 --> 02:34:14.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know against that we enter it
correctly rather than.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/705-0
02:34:15.095 --> 02:34:18.547
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>TBC yeah,
if we can validate against that format,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/705-1
02:34:18.547 --> 02:34:24.277
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>at least all the you know you've got a a
good starting point to go to. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/705-2
02:34:24.277 --> 02:34:29.869
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But it's that's the main one. That's yeah,
definitely. Always the matter number.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/705-3
02:34:29.869 --> 02:34:32.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then we would just action on that
basis.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/706-0
02:34:34.335 --> 02:34:39.177
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>At the moment we will be treated as a
sort of separate manual breakdown of all</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/706-1
02:34:39.177 --> 02:34:41.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the time that we sort of move over to
excel.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/706-2
02:34:41.935 --> 02:34:46.900
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We just set it all up so that then show
each entity will get a breakdown of what</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/706-3
02:34:46.900 --> 02:34:49.964
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>all the time was and what each entity
shared was.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/706-4
02:34:49.964 --> 02:34:52.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Phone has gone rather than having excel.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/707-0
02:34:52.895 --> 02:34:56.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You could have those you know table and
ServiceNow that shows you because</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/707-1
02:34:56.855 --> 02:34:59.852
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>otherwise you'll be working in another
parallel system.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/707-2
02:34:59.852 --> 02:35:03.277
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Certainly that information can come to
you as a presented form.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/707-3
02:35:03.277 --> 02:35:07.505
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Then it becomes your working place so
that you don't have to then because I do</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/707-4
02:35:07.505 --> 02:35:10.287
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then enter it into Excel and then work on
it. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/707-5
02:35:10.287 --> 02:35:12.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we would sort of export all the
information.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/708-0
02:35:12.735 --> 02:35:17.143
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>From three E&amp;T excel,
OK and then sort of a right make it look</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/708-1
02:35:17.143 --> 02:35:22.471
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>pretty OK because you're just getting a
subset of that information that you need</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/708-2
02:35:22.471 --> 02:35:27.272
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to work on and then you're working. OK,
that's fine. But you could have,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/708-3
02:35:27.272 --> 02:35:30.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as you said,
if you capture as much information.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/709-0
02:35:31.215 --> 02:35:34.414
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>In the request,
then at least then you know which matter</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/709-1
02:35:34.414 --> 02:35:37.669
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to go to. Yeah. Yeah.
So they come in and do they have an</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/709-2
02:35:37.669 --> 02:35:42.102
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>effective date on that or is it just now
you've got to do it from this date to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/709-3
02:35:42.102 --> 02:35:45.357
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that date? Is it,
is it always moving forward or is it an</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/709-4
02:35:45.357 --> 02:35:49.847
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>effective date that you it's just for and
it can change next month and then you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/709-5
02:35:49.847 --> 02:35:50.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>know it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/710-0
02:35:50.695 --> 02:35:54.064
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It just depends on the instruction.
I mean it might be all. It's only.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/710-1
02:35:54.064 --> 02:35:57.859
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's only particularly for that invoice.
So you're only splitting that bill for</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/710-2
02:35:57.859 --> 02:36:01.369
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that invoice that you're generating.
And next month it might be something</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/710-3
02:36:01.369 --> 02:36:04.453
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>different. Yeah. I mean,
if it was the same matter, chances are,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/710-4
02:36:04.453 --> 02:36:08.201
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and the the request them each month it it
would probably be on that same basis</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/710-5
02:36:08.201 --> 02:36:10.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because that's probably what they've
agreed.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/711-0
02:36:10.535 --> 02:36:14.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But you know it it it could change.
It just depends on, OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/711-1
02:36:14.495 --> 02:36:17.663
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what the agreement is with the the
clients, OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/711-2
02:36:17.663 --> 02:36:22.745
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And so once it's saved in three that
becomes the default values for that for</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/711-3
02:36:22.745 --> 02:36:26.903
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>those clients, yeah.
If we well again it could it could change</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/711-4
02:36:26.903 --> 02:36:30.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because OK it's it's a wee bit different
if we had.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/712-0
02:36:33.375 --> 02:36:39.134
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Jump on we've we've got third party pair
bills and we sometimes have multi what we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/712-1
02:36:39.134 --> 02:36:44.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>call a multi pair where as varies. Yeah,
third parties and they'll be paying a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/712-2
02:36:44.615 --> 02:36:50.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>percentage and on that we would set that
up matter level. So FC the following.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/714-0
02:36:50.175 --> 02:36:55.510
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Being monthly wanted another invoice in
that basis when the pro forma was</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/714-1
02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:58.970
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>generated,
it would pull through those peers at</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/714-2
02:36:58.970 --> 02:37:04.233
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>those percentages automatically,
but with actual split call client split</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/714-3
02:37:04.233 --> 02:37:07.837
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>matters.
It's going against different matters and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/714-4
02:37:07.837 --> 02:37:09.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's different clients.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/715-0
02:37:09.935 --> 02:37:12.787
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's and.
They're all Co client split bills.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/715-1
02:37:12.787 --> 02:37:16.652
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is that how they are?
That's how you determine the Co client</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/715-2
02:37:16.652 --> 02:37:21.403
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>split bills. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, OK,
sometimes there might be split bills,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/715-3
02:37:21.403 --> 02:37:25.712
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but they're not Co client.
But it I'd say probably in most cases it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/715-4
02:37:25.712 --> 02:37:26.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is Co client.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/716-0
02:37:26.895 --> 02:37:30.956
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But the form that query form could
capture those exceptions where it isn't</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/716-1
02:37:30.956 --> 02:37:34.475
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Co client as well. You know,
depending on what we're asking them</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/716-2
02:37:34.475 --> 02:37:36.966
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>upfront,
it would lead them into into that we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/716-3
02:37:36.966 --> 02:37:40.431
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>wouldn't. I mean again,
we wouldn't even always know if it's Co</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/716-4
02:37:40.431 --> 02:37:43.029
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>client,
sometimes they tell you they don't have</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/716-5
02:37:43.029 --> 02:37:43.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to tell us it's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/717-0
02:37:44.655 --> 02:37:48.045
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But would they know that he might not
even know it again?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/717-1
02:37:48.045 --> 02:37:51.260
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They're just following instruction from
their partner,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/717-2
02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:55.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so they in some cases they will know,
and they'll mention that other cases? No,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/717-3
02:37:55.935 --> 02:38:00.026
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they've just been told to ask for an
invoice based on this basis. OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/717-4
02:38:00.026 --> 02:38:03.007
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>All right.
And the terminology of whether it is Co</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/717-5
02:38:03.007 --> 02:38:04.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>client or client is.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/718-0
02:38:04.655 --> 02:38:07.520
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>An added bonus,
but the fact that you have to follow that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/718-1
02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:10.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>instruction anyway with the details. OK,
that's helpful.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/719-0
02:38:14.415 --> 02:38:14.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/720-0
02:38:14.615 --> 02:38:18.326
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So then we've gone into.
So I was going to say is it an action off</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/720-1
02:38:18.326 --> 02:38:22.147
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the back of the happy path,
but it isn't that it's just a query that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/720-2
02:38:22.147 --> 02:38:24.639
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>comes into you that you then split the
bill,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/720-3
02:38:24.639 --> 02:38:29.124
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>do they have to get pre approval for that?
Is it assumed that the partners given</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/720-4
02:38:29.124 --> 02:38:33.609
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>them the approval and they have to cheque
received approval you know they're not</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/720-5
02:38:33.609 --> 02:38:34.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>acting on their?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/721-0
02:38:34.655 --> 02:38:37.429
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Of course,
they're not acting on their own free will</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/721-1
02:38:37.429 --> 02:38:40.099
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to do it,
but it's the fact that they've you could</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/721-2
02:38:40.099 --> 02:38:43.553
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just check that, you know,
you don't have any supporting evidence</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/721-3
02:38:43.553 --> 02:38:46.536
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that you need.
We just need it that you it's an inferred</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/721-4
02:38:46.536 --> 02:38:49.834
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>approval approval. OK.
But it could be just a a check box that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/721-5
02:38:49.834 --> 02:38:50.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/722-0
02:38:50.575 --> 02:38:55.473
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know, they're sort of stamping. Yes,
I've got that approval to move forward.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/722-1
02:38:55.473 --> 02:38:59.706
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean, it's not officiated,
but it's the fact that it just sets that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/722-2
02:38:59.706 --> 02:39:04.544
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>tone, that it's an improved approved,
you know for this is also for an audit or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/722-3
02:39:04.544 --> 02:39:06.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>supporting evidence that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/723-0
02:39:06.495 --> 02:39:12.270
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The P can say it was approved, you know,
and it's just gives that audit trail that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/723-1
02:39:12.270 --> 02:39:17.002
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>everything they're asking has been
approved by their their partner,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/723-2
02:39:17.002 --> 02:39:20.341
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as it were.
I think you'll actually find that a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/723-3
02:39:20.341 --> 02:39:26.047
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>partner from an SRE perspective has the
responsibility to ensure that his billing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/723-4
02:39:26.047 --> 02:39:26.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/724-0
02:39:26.455 --> 02:39:30.048
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Accurate.
So he has a statutory responsibility,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/724-1
02:39:30.048 --> 02:39:36.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>which is probably one of the reasons why
they like to send the bill out ultimately.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/724-2
02:39:36.335 --> 02:39:40.527
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So they they have a, you know,
a formal responsibility.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/724-3
02:39:40.527 --> 02:39:44.269
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Whether they do that or not is a
different thing,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/724-4
02:39:44.269 --> 02:39:46.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but they do have a formal.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/725-0
02:39:46.335 --> 02:39:50.527
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Responsibility I believe to do that,
and I suppose it's just capturing that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/725-1
02:39:50.527 --> 02:39:54.991
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's what I'm saying is rather than the
PE just sending a request there is that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/725-2
02:39:54.991 --> 02:39:57.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>check box that the approval has been
granted.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/726-0
02:39:59.855 --> 02:40:05.463
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think we're going to,
I think we should watch that we end up</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/726-1
02:40:05.463 --> 02:40:12.406
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>creating an audit field that could fight
against us if that box isn't ticked,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/726-2
02:40:12.406 --> 02:40:16.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because, well, it could be that it's not.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/727-0
02:40:16.535 --> 02:40:20.927
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It doesn't get submitted unless I mean.
I know that they they just end up taking</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/727-1
02:40:20.927 --> 02:40:23.584
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it. I mean,
it's inferred in approval anyway and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/727-2
02:40:23.584 --> 02:40:26.187
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you're just capturing that.
It's been approved.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/727-3
02:40:26.187 --> 02:40:28.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You're capturing that inferred approval,
yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/728-0
02:40:30.295 --> 02:40:34.281
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think it could be difficult because
again, we've got like,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/728-1
02:40:34.281 --> 02:40:37.743
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean I can certainly park that with the
hub teams,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/728-2
02:40:37.743 --> 02:40:43.035
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>this sort of a team like assistance and
sometimes the PE will get an instruction</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/728-3
02:40:43.035 --> 02:40:48.393
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>from the partner and she'll then forward
it on to them who might submit it to us.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/728-4
02:40:48.393 --> 02:40:49.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So again, I think that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/729-0
02:40:50.015 --> 02:40:54.779
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Maybe be quite confused and then if
they're like, I don't know. OK. All right,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/729-1
02:40:54.779 --> 02:40:59.363
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we can part that. But if it's some,
I mean it's certainly available that if</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/729-2
02:40:59.363 --> 02:41:04.368
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you wanted, yeah, that. But it. Yeah, OK.
If it opens up a minefield of, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/729-3
02:41:04.368 --> 02:41:08.830
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>actually they did it and it wasn't.
And I don't know the approval and all</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/729-4
02:41:08.830 --> 02:41:09.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that, but it was.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/730-0
02:41:09.975 --> 02:41:12.477
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, I just thought it would be worth,
you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/730-1
02:41:12.477 --> 02:41:16.529
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>whether you needed to seek that approval
and some of the things that we've done,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/730-2
02:41:16.529 --> 02:41:19.080
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know,
in cashew and particularly that vault of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/730-3
02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:21.782
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>all the money,
you know that approval trail had to be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/730-4
02:41:21.782 --> 02:41:24.583
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>very defined.
We there's not really much that we really</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/730-5
02:41:24.583 --> 02:41:28.035
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>require, you know, like. Yes. Yeah.
I think we've only got it right.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/730-6
02:41:28.035 --> 02:41:29.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And we've got one instruction.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/731-0
02:41:29.655 --> 02:41:33.964
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, as you said,
probably under the SOA that approval is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/731-1
02:41:33.964 --> 02:41:39.806
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is built into those processes anyway,
and you're generating those invoices. OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/731-2
02:41:39.806 --> 02:41:44.918
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's good. I'm not jumping,
I'm just trying to join the dots as I'm</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/731-3
02:41:44.918 --> 02:41:45.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>speaking.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/732-0
02:41:48.095 --> 02:41:52.122
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So that is the credit.
So we've gone through the your processes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/732-1
02:41:52.122 --> 02:41:57.155
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and then gone back to whip and then just
probably those other actions that come</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/732-2
02:41:57.155 --> 02:42:01.748
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>out of that. I'm not sure if there's,
I think some of these probably are</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/732-3
02:42:01.748 --> 02:42:05.586
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>queries in the room, right,
not on the back of the the past.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/732-4
02:42:05.586 --> 02:42:07.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So maybe I'll just whiz.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/733-0
02:42:07.415 --> 02:42:10.157
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Through them.
So you've got credit bills now.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/733-1
02:42:10.157 --> 02:42:14.388
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Does that come as a result of that you
need to generate based on maybe</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/733-2
02:42:14.388 --> 02:42:19.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>differences of invoice values that you're
creating those credit bills or is that a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/733-3
02:42:19.335 --> 02:42:24.222
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>request that they've been from the again
from the PE that you need to on the back</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/733-4
02:42:24.222 --> 02:42:25.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of this invoice?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/734-0
02:42:26.135 --> 02:42:30.867
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>This credit because of timing or it was
sent out here or we've been slightly</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/734-1
02:42:30.867 --> 02:42:34.370
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>confused the way it's worthy because it's
a credit bill,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/734-2
02:42:34.370 --> 02:42:38.918
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's it's created account billing.
So it's not actually a credit and it's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/734-3
02:42:38.918 --> 02:42:43.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>actually local credit account billing.
It's actually a credit account write off.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/735-0
02:42:45.455 --> 02:42:50.467
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we're and that's a request that comes
in not as an action off the back of you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/735-1
02:42:50.467 --> 02:42:54.118
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>processing invoice, no,
no over the request that comes in.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/735-2
02:42:54.118 --> 02:42:58.882
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's been agreed we see certain
clients that there is almost like certain</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/735-3
02:42:58.882 --> 02:43:01.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>discounts that they will apply to them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/736-0
02:43:01.655 --> 02:43:04.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So the time gets written off.
We've doing it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/736-1
02:43:04.735 --> 02:43:09.955
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it gets written off to the credit account.
So the partner, still the partner,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/736-2
02:43:09.955 --> 02:43:15.243
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>still receives credit for that work.
So although we've not actually issuing an</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/736-3
02:43:15.243 --> 02:43:18.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>invoice,
it's it's not a standard write off.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/737-0
02:43:18.655 --> 02:43:22.599
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's a part of a sort of agreement with
the the client,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/737-1
02:43:22.599 --> 02:43:28.022
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so you get that as a query today and what
what? What actions do you then do,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/737-2
02:43:28.022 --> 02:43:33.868
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know the chairwell today and then you
do the what sort of thing do you have to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/737-3
02:43:33.868 --> 02:43:38.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>do on the back of that we just we would
have to if one sort of.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/738-0
02:43:38.615 --> 02:43:45.297
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We generate the pro forma because we have
to get a pro forma to do it and then if</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/738-1
02:43:45.297 --> 02:43:51.978
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's generally though, we'll see like 70,
000 of no times to go to credit account</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/738-2
02:43:51.978 --> 02:43:56.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>for this matter.
So we will allocate the oldest 70,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/738-3
02:43:56.215 --> 02:43:58.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>000 as close as we can get.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/739-0
02:43:58.455 --> 02:44:03.122
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You never get the exact value and we
change the work type to create an account.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/739-1
02:44:03.122 --> 02:44:06.972
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's all in 3E in three E, OK,
and then that's right comes into</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/739-2
02:44:06.972 --> 02:44:10.005
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ServiceNow.
You might say in as your query that you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/739-3
02:44:10.005 --> 02:44:14.439
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>would get in ServiceNow, I don't know.
We'll talk about that skills matrix,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/739-4
02:44:14.439 --> 02:44:16.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>whether those types of things because.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/740-0
02:44:17.095 --> 02:44:22.497
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There for that nature that they might go
to a certain member of the team or it's a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/740-1
02:44:22.497 --> 02:44:26.206
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>certain value,
or whether all the team pick it up. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/740-2
02:44:26.206 --> 02:44:30.110
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we can decide that.
Or you can decide that we do the skills</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/740-3
02:44:30.110 --> 02:44:34.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>matrix and then it can be on the action,
you know, updated in free.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/741-0
02:44:34.975 --> 02:44:37.541
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know,
capture that and then it's closed.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/741-1
02:44:37.541 --> 02:44:42.101
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Complete. Yeah. There's no other is.
It tends to be that when you get them you,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/741-2
02:44:42.101 --> 02:44:46.547
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there's no push back or you find that
you're not going to write it off or are</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/741-3
02:44:46.547 --> 02:44:51.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they tend to be again, I call them happy.
Yeah. They're pretty standard. Yeah. Now.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/742-0
02:44:53.215 --> 02:44:59.151
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But they tend to be raised by the PE.
Yeah. Or requested by the PE. Generally.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/742-1
02:44:59.151 --> 02:45:02.757
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah,
there's a wee bit of confusion with them,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/742-2
02:45:02.757 --> 02:45:07.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and it's a lot. Again,
the terminology within Asher for them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/743-0
02:45:08.055 --> 02:45:13.227
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is because some people call them value
account and other people call them credit</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/743-1
02:45:13.227 --> 02:45:17.761
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>account and we have two separate
processes so usually depending on how</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/743-2
02:45:17.761 --> 02:45:21.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's been requested,
there's usually it's usually myself who</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/743-3
02:45:21.655 --> 02:45:24.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>goes back because I tend to know them a
bit better.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/744-0
02:45:25.495 --> 02:45:29.888
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And when they ask for something to go to
the value account, I tend to big back.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/744-1
02:45:29.888 --> 02:45:34.390
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Or do you actually mean you want us to go
here because and explain the difference</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/744-2
02:45:34.390 --> 02:45:37.519
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>between the policy,
there is interchange of terminology,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/744-3
02:45:37.519 --> 02:45:40.648
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but there is 2.
I mean we did client and trust the other</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/744-4
02:45:40.648 --> 02:45:45.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>day, but they actually wonders, you know,
rock, paper, scissors. What? Actually.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/745-0
02:45:45.175 --> 02:45:48.630
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we're going to call it,
but these value account and the credit</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/745-1
02:45:48.630 --> 02:45:52.347
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>card are credit account are two separate
things. They're two separate,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/745-2
02:45:52.347 --> 02:45:56.221
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>even though it's in exchange of and
everybody always calls one the other.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/745-3
02:45:56.221 --> 02:46:00.042
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So that's and why do we do that?
Is that a learning curve bit where they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/745-4
02:46:00.042 --> 02:46:03.916
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>could actually say the reason it's this
name and this name, I mean, yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/745-5
02:46:03.916 --> 02:46:05.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's a difficult one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/746-0
02:46:05.055 --> 02:46:10.467
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And and I I I don't know what as it just
seems to be because for years folk call</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/746-1
02:46:10.467 --> 02:46:15.611
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it. I think part of it is the site,
I don't see if I think it's called might</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/746-2
02:46:15.611 --> 02:46:19.352
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>actually officially be called the credit
value account.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/746-3
02:46:19.352 --> 02:46:23.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But there also as value account billing
where it gets right and it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/747-0
02:46:24.695 --> 02:46:28.284
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's and they're the worksite we use.
Is called credit account and it just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/747-1
02:46:28.284 --> 02:46:31.059
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>causes confusion,
but usually it sounds like three things</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/747-2
02:46:31.059 --> 02:46:33.738
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there as well.
There credit and value value and a yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/747-3
02:46:33.738 --> 02:46:36.609
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So maybe that's a term you know when
they're requesting it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/747-4
02:46:36.609 --> 02:46:40.436
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think it could be straight handy for
that vitos presumably that business rule</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/747-5
02:46:40.436 --> 02:46:43.546
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is that they always go.
I'm not going to guess which one it goes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/747-6
02:46:43.546 --> 02:46:44.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to, but it goes to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/748-0
02:46:44.495 --> 02:46:47.516
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So the credit accounts write off.
Is that correct,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/748-1
02:46:47.516 --> 02:46:51.365
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>even though they might say it's value,
you know that it's going.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/748-2
02:46:51.365 --> 02:46:55.569
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I will always get them to confirm.
I'll always go back and explain the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/748-3
02:46:55.569 --> 02:46:58.412
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>difference between them and get them to
put it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/748-4
02:46:58.412 --> 02:47:02.557
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I know Mark's going to interject because
I can hear him for a minute,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/748-5
02:47:02.557 --> 02:47:04.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but that's something we can.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/750-0
02:47:04.935 --> 02:47:10.028
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's something. Which one? Yeah.
So that could be a part of that request</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/750-1
02:47:10.028 --> 02:47:14.509
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>learning that they're the the
differentiating the two and it will</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/750-2
02:47:14.509 --> 02:47:17.972
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>probably be,
you know in the initial phase they'll</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/750-3
02:47:17.972 --> 02:47:23.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just pick one but they but but saying
that it can go to either that write off.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/751-0
02:47:25.415 --> 02:47:28.511
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>No, not really.
It just be a different than our value.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/751-1
02:47:28.511 --> 02:47:31.382
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Account matters where you just write off
the time,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/751-2
02:47:31.382 --> 02:47:33.915
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so that's where it's it's just to make
sure.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/751-3
02:47:33.915 --> 02:47:36.729
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm just thinking whatever they select
then yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/751-4
02:47:36.729 --> 02:47:40.725
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm just thinking what the outcome.
So if they pick value or they pick</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/751-5
02:47:40.725 --> 02:47:41.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>credits.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/752-0
02:47:42.295 --> 02:47:46.357
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It it does have different actions of
where you write it off against. OK. Sorry,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/752-1
02:47:46.357 --> 02:47:48.946
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sandeep,
you're going to say I'm slightly confused</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/752-2
02:47:48.946 --> 02:47:53.160
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>when will that pop up box trigger at the
start. So when they're doing their query,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/752-3
02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:56.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you could have a validation,
you know when they're doing the write off.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/753-0
02:47:57.495 --> 02:48:01.790
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It could be if they picked, you know,
so the keyword would that they want to be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/753-1
02:48:01.790 --> 02:48:04.958
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>doing this right off.
It would could almost that option be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/753-2
02:48:04.958 --> 02:48:05.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>always there.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/754-0
02:48:07.135 --> 02:48:09.866
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Will that are you asking me?
Can it be or will it be?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/754-1
02:48:09.866 --> 02:48:13.102
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Will it be always there? Yeah.
So when they're doing the right,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/754-2
02:48:13.102 --> 02:48:17.198
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so they've generated query and service.
Now it's a write off on that keywords it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/754-3
02:48:17.198 --> 02:48:21.294
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>should be did you want a credit account
or a value account and then you can have</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/754-4
02:48:21.294 --> 02:48:25.137
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the FAQ or explanation next to it so that
you know what credit account is I</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/754-5
02:48:25.137 --> 02:48:25.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>wouldn't value.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/755-0
02:48:26.575 --> 02:48:30.925
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I wouldn't really want them mixed in with
the other write offs because although the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/755-1
02:48:30.925 --> 02:48:35.119
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>process we do is a write off to their
mind, it's something completely different.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/755-2
02:48:35.119 --> 02:48:37.811
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Don't call it. What is it?
What would they call it?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/755-3
02:48:37.811 --> 02:48:41.228
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They always tend to ask for like it's
like a credit account bill,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/755-4
02:48:41.228 --> 02:48:45.008
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but they don't get a bill. OK,
so the action that you do is a write off,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/755-5
02:48:45.008 --> 02:48:46.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but they're actually.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/756-0
02:48:46.175 --> 02:48:51.052
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Asking for a credit account bill,
would you like a credit? So as you said,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/756-1
02:48:51.052 --> 02:48:54.888
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's been, yeah. So they don't,
there's no actual invoice,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/756-2
02:48:54.888 --> 02:48:58.984
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it it's just they're not there.
So client account billing,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/756-3
02:48:58.984 --> 02:49:03.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we only do one or two, so they're not.
So what would they know it as?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/757-0
02:49:04.815 --> 02:49:08.116
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's a problem.
That's what I always go have to go back.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/757-1
02:49:08.116 --> 02:49:11.921
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But usually because again,
sometimes when I went back and said blah</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/757-2
02:49:11.921 --> 02:49:14.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>blah,
that's written off to here and then the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/757-3
02:49:14.495 --> 02:49:18.747
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the partner comes in panic and go.
I don't want a write off and you have to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/757-4
02:49:18.747 --> 02:49:22.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then explain it isn't written off,
but it's to the credit account.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/758-0
02:49:23.375 --> 02:49:28.709
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's the process we need to do,
so maybe that language is when we notify</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/758-1
02:49:28.709 --> 02:49:33.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>them back is less scarce,
more about what they ask for. For example,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/758-2
02:49:33.615 --> 02:49:38.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>how do we just send an e-mail when they
don't need to ask for anything?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/759-0
02:49:39.055 --> 02:49:43.582
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But what we're trying to do is put it
through a form so that they can like</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/759-1
02:49:43.582 --> 02:49:46.781
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>maybe click.
I've got a request I want to and that's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/759-2
02:49:46.781 --> 02:49:50.403
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what we need. Is that word.
And I want to do the following.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/759-3
02:49:50.403 --> 02:49:53.541
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What would they, can I say to you,
do they call it?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/759-4
02:49:53.541 --> 02:49:55.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I want to take action accounts, credit.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/760-0
02:49:56.815 --> 02:50:01.072
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I want a credit bill. Yes,
I think this working would probably be if</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/760-1
02:50:01.072 --> 02:50:05.513
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they'll be able to go. I want. Yeah,
I want to. We want to allocate 70,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/760-2
02:50:05.513 --> 02:50:10.325
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>000 of time to the credit account. OK.
So I would say the I want to allocate,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/760-3
02:50:10.325 --> 02:50:12.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>allocate it to it rather than.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/761-0
02:50:12.935 --> 02:50:16.269
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Be right off,
it might be useful to see some of those</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/761-1
02:50:16.269 --> 02:50:21.207
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>queries that you've got in share world
just to capture some of the language and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/761-2
02:50:21.207 --> 02:50:25.959
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then we could say I can't because they
call it seven different things. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/765-0
02:50:24.575 --> 02:50:27.503
<v Mark Sedge>If it helps,
one of the things you could do is have</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/761-3
02:50:25.959 --> 02:50:27.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's it's sorry Mark.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/765-1
02:50:27.503 --> 02:50:29.924
<v Mark Sedge>two.
One that says what they want and then</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/762-0
02:50:28.695 --> 02:50:28.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/765-2
02:50:29.924 --> 02:50:34.596
<v Mark Sedge>another cell to say what outcome are they
expecting because sometimes they may not</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/763-0
02:50:34.295 --> 02:50:34.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/765-3
02:50:34.596 --> 02:50:39.044
<v Mark Sedge>ask in the right way but from the outcome
that they're looking for gives you a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/764-0
02:50:37.535 --> 02:50:37.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/765-4
02:50:39.044 --> 02:50:41.295
<v Mark Sedge>better clear of what they actually want.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/767-0
02:50:41.775 --> 02:50:44.816
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah,
almost that you use the story as a person.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/767-1
02:50:44.816 --> 02:50:49.408
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I want to do the following so that the
money goes from. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/766-0
02:50:46.695 --> 02:50:47.055
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/767-2
02:50:49.408 --> 02:50:54.311
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think as long as it wasn't and together
with other write offs because how we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/767-3
02:50:54.311 --> 02:50:58.468
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>receive hundreds of them.
So sure you just want them to be a right</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/767-4
02:50:58.468 --> 02:50:59.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>off question right off.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/768-0
02:51:00.775 --> 02:51:04.003
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They would use. We won't.
We won't put that on that side.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/768-1
02:51:04.003 --> 02:51:07.676
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So what we need to get to is the language
that they'll use. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/768-2
02:51:07.676 --> 02:51:10.625
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that would be a different thing to you.
That's fine.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/768-3
02:51:10.625 --> 02:51:14.798
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The system will figure that out. Yeah.
Yeah, we do our job properly. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/768-4
02:51:14.798 --> 02:51:17.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If I could just jump in. Dave. Sorry back.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/769-0
02:51:17.695 --> 02:51:20.362
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>A wee while ago,
if we go back maybe half an hour,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/769-1
02:51:20.362 --> 02:51:24.336
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>when we were all kind of talking about
how we get the PES to use consistent</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/769-2
02:51:24.336 --> 02:51:28.205
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>processes and take accountability,
and there's a piece of work being done</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/769-3
02:51:28.205 --> 02:51:32.284
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>around their relationships and everything
else is, is this sort of, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/769-4
02:51:32.284 --> 02:51:34.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the definition of certain types of task.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/770-0
02:51:34.935 --> 02:51:38.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Going to be built into that is that being
covered off so that there is that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/770-1
02:51:38.735 --> 02:51:41.635
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>consistent language getting modelled
against the process,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/770-2
02:51:41.635 --> 02:51:45.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so that if I if you say to somebody,
this is a value or it's a write off,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/770-3
02:51:45.335 --> 02:51:48.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's very, very clear what it is.
So as because as much as we can build</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/770-4
02:51:48.935 --> 02:51:52.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>stuff that's here's a paragraph that
tells you if we actually build it into</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/770-5
02:51:52.735 --> 02:51:53.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the process.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/771-0
02:51:53.735 --> 02:51:56.371
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And change,
you know if we're talking to be easy</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/771-1
02:51:56.371 --> 02:51:59.006
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>anyway,
about how they make change their ways of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/771-2
02:51:59.006 --> 02:52:01.748
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>working,
we can actually agree what we're going to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/771-3
02:52:01.748 --> 02:52:05.190
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>call these things. Yeah.
Is that part of it or would that be an</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/771-4
02:52:05.190 --> 02:52:08.040
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>extension of it or I think, yeah,
it probably would.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/771-5
02:52:08.040 --> 02:52:12.289
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think the problem a lot of the time
again it it comes from what the partners</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/771-6
02:52:12.289 --> 02:52:13.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>telling the PE.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/772-0
02:52:14.415 --> 02:52:20.698
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>To do and if they've not came across that
like a request before of that sort of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/772-1
02:52:20.698 --> 02:52:27.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what's been asked, then they don't know.
So they just come to us with a very vague.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/773-0
02:52:28.815 --> 02:52:32.447
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Now how? Yeah, again.
What's something I appreciate also this</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/773-1
02:52:32.447 --> 02:52:36.958
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>about a rabbit hole for something that
you don't do every day. So, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/773-2
02:52:36.958 --> 02:52:41.117
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't really think it. Yeah.
I think probably in time like with that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/773-3
02:52:41.117 --> 02:52:44.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>if you're seeing if there's a form thing
and it's there.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/774-0
02:52:44.975 --> 02:52:47.988
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There's probably a few queries to begin
with,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/774-1
02:52:47.988 --> 02:52:52.898
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but they they would get into the swing of
and no or that's actually there.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/774-2
02:52:52.898 --> 02:52:54.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's the section there.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/775-0
02:53:04.295 --> 02:53:09.085
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Switched myself off as I was eating that
because I was opening it quietly are the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/775-1
02:53:09.085 --> 02:53:13.817
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>right offs of this type that's probably
open another can of worms that there are</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/775-2
02:53:13.817 --> 02:53:18.724
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>other types of right off so these tend to
come as a reactive behaviour of something</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/775-3
02:53:18.724 --> 02:53:22.054
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>else. Are they preventable?
Is probably what I'm saying.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/775-4
02:53:22.054 --> 02:53:23.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>These credit count ones.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/776-0
02:53:23.695 --> 02:53:27.680
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>No, no, no. That requirement. Yeah,
a requirement. OK. All right. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/776-1
02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:31.720
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But we could standardise that that
language and then back to the PS when</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/776-2
02:53:31.720 --> 02:53:36.314
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they start to use the same terminology as
you when the partner might say something</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/776-3
02:53:36.314 --> 02:53:40.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>different, they know that actually,
I know that he's or he or she is saying.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/777-0
02:53:40.935 --> 02:53:44.868
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's for this. Yeah, as well.
And they could try correct that language</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/777-1
02:53:44.868 --> 02:53:47.970
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>up that street,
that whole language part is a big part.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/777-2
02:53:47.970 --> 02:53:51.239
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Early Ruth and Joy's part around this
change. So actually,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/777-3
02:53:51.239 --> 02:53:55.892
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we'll put some language in that we think
will be right, but it'll be tested, right?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/777-4
02:53:55.892 --> 02:54:00.379
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And that kind of heads up will be given
to whoever it is that will be requesting</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/777-5
02:54:00.379 --> 02:54:00.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/778-0
02:54:00.775 --> 02:54:03.673
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sort of stuff we can make tweaks and
things like that too,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/778-1
02:54:03.673 --> 02:54:06.521
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so I know it maybe feels that we're, like,
tie this down,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/778-2
02:54:06.521 --> 02:54:09.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it's it's going to be movable and
we'll test it, you know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/779-0
02:54:12.375 --> 02:54:12.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/780-0
02:54:15.455 --> 02:54:15.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/781-0
02:54:16.175 --> 02:54:20.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And I'm sure in service now you know when
you hover over the question mark to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/781-1
02:54:20.335 --> 02:54:23.909
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>explain what a field is,
I'm sure they'll have something like that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/781-2
02:54:23.909 --> 02:54:26.522
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as well.
So even when they come to like once the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/781-3
02:54:26.522 --> 02:54:30.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>system goes live and they come to
actually submitting the request there and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/781-4
02:54:30.575 --> 02:54:35.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then hopefully they can see that guidance
as well around what what that language is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/781-5
02:54:35.055 --> 02:54:35.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and what.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/782-0
02:54:36.095 --> 02:54:38.958
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The request is is for exactly. Oh good.
Yeah. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/782-1
02:54:38.958 --> 02:54:43.526
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And even the leading questions would be,
you know, people don't tend to, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/782-2
02:54:43.526 --> 02:54:47.489
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they just fill it in. They want to.
They're busy. They want to pass it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/782-3
02:54:47.489 --> 02:54:50.407
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then it's done.
It's off their plate for at least 10</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/782-4
02:54:50.407 --> 02:54:53.269
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>minutes. They can stop thinking about it,
you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/782-5
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:55.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we'll have those leading questions.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/783-0
02:54:55.575 --> 02:54:59.890
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That they come in, I mean,
is it a good time to now talk about write</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/783-1
02:54:59.890 --> 02:55:04.829
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>offs in general or does that come out of
complex billing? Are they tend to be?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/783-2
02:55:04.829 --> 02:55:08.205
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>No no general write offs part of complex
billing? No.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/783-3
02:55:08.205 --> 02:55:11.269
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's fairly such a simple process.
Write offs,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/783-4
02:55:11.269 --> 02:55:14.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>write offs generally general ones not the
credit account.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/784-0
02:55:15.495 --> 02:55:17.903
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK,
so right off generally they come as</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/784-1
02:55:17.903 --> 02:55:22.236
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>queries are they and are they part of
reactive behaviour or that's just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/784-2
02:55:22.236 --> 02:55:26.509
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>something that you do a lot of that's
part of billing basically. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/784-3
02:55:26.509 --> 02:55:28.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it can just be certain time that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/785-0
02:55:30.215 --> 02:55:34.528
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They just don't want to really charge for
OK, you know, and how it could maybe be,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/785-1
02:55:34.528 --> 02:55:37.074
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know,
some trainee time that would have took</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/785-2
02:55:37.074 --> 02:55:41.074
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>how longer than there were exemptions of
the billing that you're that you're</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/785-3
02:55:41.074 --> 02:55:43.776
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>creating,
just say the things they wouldn't want to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/785-4
02:55:43.776 --> 02:55:47.517
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>charge or they're like they need to know
how not charge for them. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/785-5
02:55:47.517 --> 02:55:49.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think there was some things that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/786-0
02:55:49.655 --> 02:55:53.214
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Some things are, you know,
they take all the research off or they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/786-1
02:55:53.214 --> 02:55:57.581
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>take all the things like that. You know,
whatever it might be agreements or they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/786-2
02:55:57.581 --> 02:56:01.085
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>may as what Louise said,
we've maybe done the final bill and but</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/786-3
02:56:01.085 --> 02:56:05.075
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there's some sort of a post now how
completion work going that you're not</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/786-4
02:56:05.075 --> 02:56:08.363
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>going to charge for.
So we've done it all some after they'll</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/786-5
02:56:08.363 --> 02:56:09.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>go create everything.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/787-0
02:56:10.255 --> 02:56:13.100
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But it's the general default.
Say for example,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/787-1
02:56:13.100 --> 02:56:17.820
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>don't charge this client for research.
Is that something that gets happens in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/787-2
02:56:17.820 --> 02:56:21.632
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>three years? Captures?
It's not something that you have to do.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/787-3
02:56:21.632 --> 02:56:26.110
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is that set as defaults? You know?
So some of the exclusions, as it were,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/787-4
02:56:26.110 --> 02:56:26.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>are set in.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/788-0
02:56:27.375 --> 02:56:30.354
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Three east.
So you don't have to manage those or is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/788-1
02:56:30.354 --> 02:56:34.764
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it tend to be that that you get these
requesting to not generate yeah on the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/788-2
02:56:34.764 --> 02:56:38.715
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>bill they would just yeah they would just
mark up and see right off.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/788-3
02:56:38.715 --> 02:56:42.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean there's certain places there's
certain time that that the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/789-0
02:56:43.215 --> 02:56:47.743
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's just non chargeable and they've
that they have their own sort of a sure</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/789-1
02:56:47.743 --> 02:56:51.926
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>non chargeable matters for that client
that they will post that time to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/789-2
02:56:51.926 --> 02:56:55.536
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But there were other sort of time that's
that's on the matter,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/789-3
02:56:55.536 --> 02:56:59.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they were just advisors some there's the
odd matter that actually.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/790-0
02:57:01.095 --> 02:57:04.568
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Set. They set up a phase for.
I can't remember what they call it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/790-1
02:57:04.568 --> 02:57:07.672
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>some say non available,
other ones will see to be written.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/790-2
02:57:07.672 --> 02:57:11.829
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think ones get to be written off and
they post it all against that phase and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/790-3
02:57:11.829 --> 02:57:14.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then they just send it in and see
everything under the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/792-0
02:57:15.415 --> 02:57:19.199
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Should be that no fees right off,
but that it it just depends on the the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/792-1
02:57:19.199 --> 02:57:21.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>individuals,
but more often than not it's just what</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/792-2
02:57:21.895 --> 02:57:26.197
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>marked up what a marked up building guide
we score throughs right then and it says</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/792-3
02:57:26.197 --> 02:57:29.152
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what we're trying to do is avoid on the
individual base.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/792-4
02:57:29.152 --> 02:57:32.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know we're trying to formalise a
process so that you don't get this.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/793-0
02:57:33.615 --> 02:57:37.171
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Rowing, arms and legs scenario.
But they would tend to write to you as</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/793-1
02:57:37.171 --> 02:57:39.725
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>razor query.
I want to write off the following and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/793-2
02:57:39.725 --> 02:57:43.731
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they'll give you the matter number or is
that is that how you would receive it?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/793-3
02:57:43.731 --> 02:57:47.037
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So again we've talked about lots of it
you'll hear is like, yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/793-4
02:57:47.037 --> 02:57:50.091
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we've talked about that.
That's great as we move through it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/793-5
02:57:50.091 --> 02:57:52.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So you'll get that validation and they'll
give you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/794-0
02:57:53.175 --> 02:57:58.098
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>From the effective date or whether there
might be a date range on the and and then</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/794-1
02:57:58.098 --> 02:58:01.894
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you receive it and then do and then
that's just close complete.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/794-2
02:58:01.894 --> 02:58:06.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's inferred that you're not going to do.
Have you got any balance and cheques that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/794-3
02:58:06.935 --> 02:58:10.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you do on that or it's just go into three
close complete?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/795-0
02:58:10.935 --> 02:58:15.032
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yes. Yeah, Model S, that's it. Yeah.
And you're attaching as part of that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/795-1
02:58:15.032 --> 02:58:19.128
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Write off. No supporting evidence.
You don't have to say anything to them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/795-2
02:58:19.128 --> 02:58:22.187
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Just confirm.
It's just confirm and then they would get</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/795-3
02:58:22.187 --> 02:58:25.573
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that automatic notification to say it's
been completed. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/795-4
02:58:25.573 --> 02:58:29.779
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't know what the SLA is on them.
Are they just they as you get them you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/795-5
02:58:29.779 --> 02:58:30.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>tend to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/796-0
02:58:31.055 --> 02:58:36.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Are they are they churn sort of activity
there which actually we try to our sort</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/796-1
02:58:36.575 --> 02:58:41.959
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of basic we have a sort of 24 hour SLE in
which we're always but only you pay.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/796-2
02:58:41.959 --> 02:58:47.207
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So you've lost sort of the 8 hours of
night you judge mean it's an SLA of 24</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/796-3
02:58:47.207 --> 02:58:49.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>hours. Does it take into account?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/797-0
02:58:49.815 --> 02:58:54.836
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So if I raise it at 9:00 AM today, it's,
you know it's due because we're going</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/797-1
02:58:54.836 --> 02:58:57.949
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>into the weekend.
If I raised it 9:00 AM Monday,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/797-2
02:58:57.949 --> 02:59:01.953
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is it 9:00 AM Tuesday,
or do you have 9:00 AM plus the working</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/797-3
02:59:01.953 --> 02:59:05.638
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>hour? Is it business? 24 hours? Yeah,
just from it. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/797-4
02:59:05.638 --> 02:59:07.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So if you send it in a in a home.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/798-0
02:59:08.575 --> 02:59:12.591
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>12 noon guarantee it'll be from 12 noon.
I mean you'll get it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/798-1
02:59:12.591 --> 02:59:16.287
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The Jack Chip most often. No, we're way,
way ahead of it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/798-2
02:59:16.287 --> 02:59:21.322
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's just to give us sort of leeway,
especially as we run into one phase where</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/798-3
02:59:21.322 --> 02:59:25.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it just becomes now easy, crazy busy.
So that just gives us leeway.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/799-0
02:59:27.415 --> 02:59:30.429
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Write offs,
as I say we we try to would basic thing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/799-1
02:59:30.429 --> 02:59:33.327
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is just all dispersed.
That's where we work from.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/799-2
02:59:33.327 --> 02:59:36.920
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But again we'll maybe,
as I say when it's a newest patient or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/799-3
02:59:36.920 --> 02:59:41.614
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>put someone on like can you get rid of
all the what we call quite wins there's a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/799-4
02:59:41.614 --> 02:59:45.786
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>whole load of write off requests there
from and nothing based on value.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/799-5
02:59:45.786 --> 02:59:46.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it could be.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/800-0
02:59:46.895 --> 02:59:49.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Write off this.
You know we need to write off.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/800-1
02:59:49.295 --> 02:59:51.899
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You don't have a threshold that says, oh,
my gosh,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/800-2
02:59:51.899 --> 02:59:55.881
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>this is a particular client or no,
they wouldn't really get that information.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/800-3
02:59:55.881 --> 02:59:59.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So say we'll try and push them forward
round about one thing because.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/801-0
03:00:00.775 --> 03:00:03.755
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We know generally what a lot of the
departments will go.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/801-1
03:00:03.755 --> 03:00:07.258
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They're going through the pro forma,
so they'll be certainly mark,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/801-2
03:00:07.258 --> 03:00:11.387
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>no markups markdowns as they're going
through it. So if we see any write offs,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/801-3
03:00:11.387 --> 03:00:14.837
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what they might want to do,
the 1X amount of time written off and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/801-4
03:00:14.837 --> 03:00:19.019
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then they want to run themselves a new
billing guide so the partner can look at</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/801-5
03:00:19.019 --> 03:00:20.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it again. So when we towards.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/802-0
03:00:20.575 --> 03:00:24.126
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And one friend,
we'll try and push them forward where we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/802-1
03:00:24.126 --> 03:00:27.802
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>can because we they won't say that's what
they want to do,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/802-2
03:00:27.802 --> 03:00:32.848
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we just know that's generally bought
and they can add multiple write offs in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/802-3
03:00:32.848 --> 03:00:36.461
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>one request like we,
yeah and then they may come back and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/802-4
03:00:36.461 --> 03:00:39.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>forth like especially with disputes team.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/803-0
03:00:40.775 --> 03:00:44.689
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>A lot of that,
their work so has to be very specific on</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/803-1
03:00:44.689 --> 03:00:50.210
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what amount gets charged to know how the
clients because they go through every</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/803-2
03:00:50.210 --> 03:00:55.941
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>entry with a outside before they request
the write off is that officiated process</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/803-3
03:00:55.941 --> 03:00:59.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>done out. So before you receive it,
that's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/804-0
03:00:59.375 --> 03:01:02.087
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Officiated.
It's been done of how much they're</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/804-1
03:01:02.087 --> 03:01:06.703
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>allowed, or disputes or anything. No,
we think they're just. They'll just keep.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/804-2
03:01:06.703 --> 03:01:11.089
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They can spend days and how a week
looking good through a billing guide and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/804-3
03:01:11.089 --> 03:01:14.204
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they'll mark up different entries and
write off some.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/804-4
03:01:14.204 --> 03:01:15.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Write up some write some down.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/805-0
03:01:16.255 --> 03:01:20.362
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Then they'll run a new one they bring in,
and it can take the best part of a week</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/805-1
03:01:20.362 --> 03:01:24.268
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>before the invoice will get issued,
but they're they're constantly working on</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/805-2
03:01:24.268 --> 03:01:27.273
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it and just making,
so we'll keep getting sort of requests.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/805-3
03:01:27.273 --> 03:01:30.728
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And for the make amendment here,
then we close it off. The next day,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/805-4
03:01:30.728 --> 03:01:33.883
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we might get another one.
And and there's an opportunity there</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/805-5
03:01:33.883 --> 03:01:35.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>where you're not getting.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/806-0
03:01:35.655 --> 03:01:40.834
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>For every activity they want to do,
it could be added to the original request</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/806-1
03:01:40.834 --> 03:01:46.212
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so that you're working on what you know.
So it's so you don't have to link them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/806-2
03:01:46.212 --> 03:01:50.196
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know you don't have 10 variations of
updates from them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/806-3
03:01:50.196 --> 03:01:55.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It can be consolidated into one. Yeah,
it sort of works that way on share.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/807-0
03:01:55.335 --> 03:01:58.690
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>At the moment,
which can be good but can be annoying</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/807-1
03:01:58.690 --> 03:02:03.943
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because once you've got that person's hit
like they're they they originally signed</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/807-2
03:02:03.943 --> 03:02:07.677
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the first ticket,
so when they send in the next request it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/807-3
03:02:07.677 --> 03:02:10.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it tends to automatically assigns to that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/808-0
03:02:11.895 --> 03:02:16.394
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Which can be good sometimes,
but it could be annoying because C Louise</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/808-1
03:02:16.394 --> 03:02:20.829
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>could have been working on it,
got that request and is now working on</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/808-2
03:02:20.829 --> 03:02:25.327
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Goldman Sachs or some horror.
But she's now got that journal again for</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/808-3
03:02:25.327 --> 03:02:29.318
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the next amendment,
and we'll keep getting it all week, right.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/808-4
03:02:29.318 --> 03:02:31.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it sounds like maybe you prefer.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/809-0
03:02:31.735 --> 03:02:35.727
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But you know, yeah.
Prefer that they are mutually exclusive,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/809-1
03:02:35.727 --> 03:02:40.308
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know, write UPS, I mean.
But there's something we can think about</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/809-2
03:02:40.308 --> 03:02:43.907
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>consolidating,
particularly if they're coming in. Yes,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/809-3
03:02:43.907 --> 03:02:48.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they're basically well from a practical
perspective in the department and.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/810-0
03:02:49.095 --> 03:02:53.382
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The is that iterative process tends to be
the norm. Do they tend to?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/810-1
03:02:53.382 --> 03:02:57.358
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Once you've done one,
you know that there's going to be another</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/810-2
03:02:57.358 --> 03:03:00.029
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>five,
or with your disputes team it's it's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/810-3
03:03:00.029 --> 03:03:03.757
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>great. So. OK. Yeah.
So when did the PE knows at that point</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/810-4
03:03:03.757 --> 03:03:08.354
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there's a dispute team involved.
I'm just thinking it's not what disputes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/810-5
03:03:08.354 --> 03:03:08.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the power.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/811-0
03:03:09.015 --> 03:03:12.180
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Department.
So the PE for what sort of disputes a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/811-1
03:03:12.180 --> 03:03:15.472
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>legal team.
So they're writing it off anyway. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/811-2
03:03:15.472 --> 03:03:20.155
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's just it's just the the sort of way
that that legal department works.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/811-3
03:03:20.155 --> 03:03:25.156
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's it's always what in every disputes a
local team would be work along those</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/811-4
03:03:25.156 --> 03:03:25.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>lines.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/812-0
03:03:26.735 --> 03:03:30.485
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Most other ones they might come back and
forth a wee bit,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/812-1
03:03:30.485 --> 03:03:35.398
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but maybe once or twice at the most,
but generally it's just right off. OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/812-2
03:03:35.398 --> 03:03:38.243
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Tickets closed. OK. Yeah.
Can I just check?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/812-3
03:03:38.243 --> 03:03:43.221
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I've seen an example where the time
entries are listed like multiple like</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/812-4
03:03:43.221 --> 03:03:45.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>50-60 time entries, you know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/813-0
03:03:45.815 --> 03:03:50.241
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And you know,
there are handwritten notes on those time</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/813-1
03:03:50.241 --> 03:03:54.351
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>entries and where some of them are, say,
remove it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/813-2
03:03:54.351 --> 03:03:59.487
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Some of them might be the write offs as
well. How do we, I mean,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/813-3
03:03:59.487 --> 03:04:05.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't like those handwritten notes
because we we do miss those out and.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/814-0
03:04:05.455 --> 03:04:09.871
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is a big kind of like risk of yeah,
you know, having a manual error,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/814-1
03:04:09.871 --> 03:04:15.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is there anything we can try to put those
handwritten on some kind of format? I,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/814-2
03:04:15.055 --> 03:04:17.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean, I don't know. I mean,
just thinking.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/815-0
03:04:20.535 --> 03:04:21.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's what they might.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/816-0
03:04:22.815 --> 03:04:27.445
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think we receive it on the PDF I've
seen on either the like the billing guide</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/816-1
03:04:27.445 --> 03:04:31.958
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>or on if the Vrana draught invoice and it
it's it's horrible or is it kind of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/816-2
03:04:31.958 --> 03:04:35.661
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>battles and yeah, yeah.
So they they've hand marked on the it's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/816-3
03:04:35.661 --> 03:04:40.233
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>like marked on with like highlighters and
then and what sort of thing are they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/816-4
03:04:40.233 --> 03:04:40.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>writing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/817-0
03:04:42.055 --> 03:04:46.434
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Because I'm thinking those instructions
can be part of the original request,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/817-1
03:04:46.434 --> 03:04:51.097
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know that they? Yeah, usually. I mean,
if it's just a straight off right off.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/817-2
03:04:51.097 --> 03:04:53.998
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Such bad.
But sometimes they want the the one that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/817-3
03:04:53.998 --> 03:04:57.808
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>might be an entry for two hours.
They want to change to 1.1 hours.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/817-4
03:04:57.808 --> 03:05:00.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Or they might want it split into two
separate entries.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/818-0
03:05:01.695 --> 03:05:04.427
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And the one one of those questions and to
take it off,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/818-1
03:05:04.427 --> 03:05:07.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that falling that they're actually
instead of spot you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/818-2
03:05:07.455 --> 03:05:11.378
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because that's because you're trying to
get these metrics from it is that they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/818-3
03:05:11.378 --> 03:05:14.804
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just say reason for write off change that
you know it could be done.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/818-4
03:05:14.804 --> 03:05:18.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't want to make it our awful journey
for them because you're just you know it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/819-0
03:05:19.495 --> 03:05:23.701
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, I mean, we push back we we,
I mean technically we don't need to know</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/819-1
03:05:23.701 --> 03:05:28.018
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>why. They're yeah. Making a job. Right.
But it's more about alleviating that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/819-2
03:05:28.018 --> 03:05:31.270
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>whole manual element.
Arrows and highlighters and do this</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/819-3
03:05:31.270 --> 03:05:33.849
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>online.
But this whole with exclamation mark.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/819-4
03:05:33.849 --> 03:05:37.158
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Avoiding that in a school through 'cause</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/819-5
03:05:37.158 --> 03:05:38.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they make a mistake. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/820-0
03:05:39.215 --> 03:05:43.199
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What? What? What do you think? Like what?
What's the solution for that?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/820-1
03:05:43.199 --> 03:05:47.127
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Those kind of issues, you know? Yeah.
I mean, not to solutionize here,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/820-2
03:05:47.127 --> 03:05:51.608
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but to see, I mean, it'd be useful to say,
but when they're actually doing those</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/820-3
03:05:51.608 --> 03:05:54.485
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>requests,
why don't they officiate that that detail</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/820-4
03:05:54.485 --> 03:05:57.860
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is part of the request to form,
which they can do, you know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/820-5
03:05:57.860 --> 03:05:58.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So they're adding.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/821-0
03:05:59.495 --> 03:06:03.035
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That you know the write off.
They're moving it from time to and it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/821-1
03:06:03.035 --> 03:06:06.100
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>tends to be categorised of time or full
amount or matter.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/821-2
03:06:06.100 --> 03:06:10.168
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean it doesn't sound difficult,
it just is part of the request, isn't it?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/821-3
03:06:10.168 --> 03:06:13.813
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You're formalising their scribbles into
the upfront request. I mean,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/821-4
03:06:13.813 --> 03:06:17.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>maybe to have a look at them would be a
good example of probably you know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/822-0
03:06:17.415 --> 03:06:20.186
<v Mark Sedge>The thing is,
with this is about the big business</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/822-1
03:06:20.186 --> 03:06:23.456
<v Mark Sedge>behaviour, right?
They're just again and maybe it's just a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/822-2
03:06:23.456 --> 03:06:26.337
<v Mark Sedge>bit lethargy,
it's easy for them to scrawl all over</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/822-3
03:06:26.337 --> 03:06:30.771
<v Mark Sedge>something and just Chuck it at you than
it is to go into a form and properly do</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/822-4
03:06:30.771 --> 03:06:33.098
<v Mark Sedge>it.
Is that is that the behaviour pattern</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/822-5
03:06:33.098 --> 03:06:34.095
<v Mark Sedge>that we're seeing?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/823-0
03:06:34.495 --> 03:06:38.797
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's in a way, yes, Mark.
And I think where I'm coming from is more</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/823-1
03:06:38.797 --> 03:06:43.541
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>about my control not to miss out
something and not to have a manual error.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/823-2
03:06:43.541 --> 03:06:45.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I'm I'm looking for, yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/826-0
03:06:43.855 --> 03:06:46.327
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.
Now I I understand what you're trying to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/826-1
03:06:46.327 --> 03:06:48.851
<v Mark Sedge>prevent.
What what we need to do is actually go</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/826-2
03:06:48.851 --> 03:06:51.323
<v Mark Sedge>back to source and say you can't submit
those.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/826-3
03:06:51.323 --> 03:06:55.530
<v Mark Sedge>You have to go through this route and
actually shut the portcullis down on that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/824-0
03:06:51.895 --> 03:06:52.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/825-0
03:06:53.695 --> 03:06:53.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/828-0
03:06:55.295 --> 03:06:59.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But which is tricky. Yeah,
but what you're saying is that you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/826-4
03:06:55.530 --> 03:06:56.055
<v Mark Sedge>behaviour.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/827-0
03:06:57.855 --> 03:06:58.815
<v Mark Sedge>I know, I know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/828-1
03:06:59.895 --> 03:07:04.421
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>receive a general query,
and they're all scribed on the PDF.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/828-2
03:07:04.421 --> 03:07:10.281
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The instructions and what we're trying to
say is that it is a. It is a system,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/828-3
03:07:10.281 --> 03:07:12.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's a platform we're trying to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/829-0
03:07:13.695 --> 03:07:17.942
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Get details. We're trying to channel.
We're trying to make it efficient and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/829-1
03:07:17.942 --> 03:07:21.631
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they've got a role and responsibility
upfront as well to provide,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/829-2
03:07:21.631 --> 03:07:24.089
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know it's just a a mechanism to get
to,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/829-3
03:07:24.089 --> 03:07:28.169
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to give you the right information that's
landed and they have a role and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/829-4
03:07:28.169 --> 03:07:31.968
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>responsibility to provide that.
You know they're they're making the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/829-5
03:07:31.968 --> 03:07:32.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>request.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/831-0
03:07:33.055 --> 03:07:35.340
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know, like, you know,
we all have requests.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/831-1
03:07:35.340 --> 03:07:38.196
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I want you to do the following.
What do you want? You know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/831-2
03:07:38.196 --> 03:07:41.861
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there has to be some detail that they'll
provide and probably that change of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/831-3
03:07:41.861 --> 03:07:45.431
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>behaviour of what schooling it onto a
PDFI. Haven't seen that for a while.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/831-4
03:07:45.431 --> 03:07:48.287
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But you're probably saying that's
probably common practise.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/831-5
03:07:48.287 --> 03:07:52.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Why don't you know there's a chance for
change that they should be officiating?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/832-0
03:07:53.895 --> 03:07:59.315
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Because they have a role as what you know,
they've asked you to do it and I know</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/832-1
03:07:59.315 --> 03:08:02.862
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that there is a often seen as then
delegated to you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/832-2
03:08:02.862 --> 03:08:06.475
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know the fact that I've handed over
will be done,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/832-3
03:08:06.475 --> 03:08:10.557
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but I'm assuming the role of
responsibility is also on them,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/832-4
03:08:10.557 --> 03:08:12.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that it gets completed.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/833-0
03:08:12.415 --> 03:08:16.837
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know, it's not a it is.
They are part of the overall workflow.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/833-1
03:08:16.837 --> 03:08:22.181
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I would say that we've got to capture
those requests officially and I I don't</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/833-2
03:08:22.181 --> 03:08:25.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>think you can workflow your way out of
this one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/833-3
03:08:25.415 --> 03:08:30.760
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think I don't think systemically that
is this is a absolute behavioural thing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/833-4
03:08:30.760 --> 03:08:31.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But I also know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/834-0
03:08:32.535 --> 03:08:35.108
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>My time and here and jump in,
everybody's been here logically.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/834-1
03:08:35.108 --> 03:08:38.457
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Me tell me if a partner's writing across
that and just be a highlight on whatever</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/834-2
03:08:38.457 --> 03:08:41.724
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>else that's going to take him 10 minutes.
If we're asking him to fill in forms,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/834-3
03:08:41.724 --> 03:08:44.992
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's going to take him an awful lot
longer and he's just not going to do that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/834-4
03:08:44.992 --> 03:08:48.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because he'd rather be doing work for a
client and billing that 20 minutes.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/835-0
03:08:48.855 --> 03:08:51.212
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So,
but it sounds like it comes from the the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/835-1
03:08:51.212 --> 03:08:55.559
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>only way you can change behaviour is when
we go back to and I know bold each other</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/835-2
03:08:55.559 --> 03:08:59.853
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to death with us, which is like your Slas,
you get a better service if you do the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/835-3
03:08:59.853 --> 03:09:02.105
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>form,
you get a long long a lower level of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/835-4
03:09:02.105 --> 03:09:04.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>service.
If you send it as APDF and whatever else.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/836-0
03:09:05.335 --> 03:09:08.284
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Again, though,
that is a challenge that's not going to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/836-1
03:09:08.284 --> 03:09:11.877
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>be something we can fix for day one
unless we extend some of these</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/836-2
03:09:11.877 --> 03:09:12.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>conversations into.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/837-0
03:09:14.535 --> 03:09:19.773
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>To cover this stuff with the PES,
etcetera to say he does it sends his TSP</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/837-1
03:09:19.773 --> 03:09:25.430
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>in D fill in the form but again that is a
step beyond the scope of this piece of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/837-2
03:09:25.430 --> 03:09:27.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>work. I mean it tends to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/838-0
03:09:28.655 --> 03:09:35.045
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You can sort of tell which ones do the
PDS and which ones give you like an X</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/838-1
03:09:35.045 --> 03:09:41.850
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>spell spreadsheet of an extra column that
you can philtre and you know my age and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/838-2
03:09:41.850 --> 03:09:45.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>above probably do. The PDS you're younger.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/839-0
03:09:45.855 --> 03:09:48.549
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>No hope. I think we need.
We need to show you some example,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/839-1
03:09:48.549 --> 03:09:50.974
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to be honest.
Exactly on on that one because it's not</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/839-2
03:09:50.974 --> 03:09:53.758
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just one partner or one PE.
There could be a matter where two</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/839-3
03:09:53.758 --> 03:09:57.304
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>partners force associates are there and
all of them are scribbling at the same</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/839-4
03:09:57.304 --> 03:09:59.460
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>time.
You don't need the metrics to prove that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/839-5
03:09:59.460 --> 03:10:02.558
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So as so that is your system.
I mean we I completely agree with you,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/839-6
03:10:02.558 --> 03:10:05.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but I think we if we show some example
then might be you know we'll.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/840-0
03:10:05.775 --> 03:10:09.075
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Have that brainstorming around. Yeah.
What would we do? Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/840-1
03:10:09.075 --> 03:10:13.227
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And I think it also comes down to how
simple we make these forms and get that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/840-2
03:10:13.227 --> 03:10:16.048
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>balance right.
So because if it's the partner that's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/840-3
03:10:16.048 --> 03:10:18.922
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>scribbling,
it's going through the PE to then come to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/840-4
03:10:18.922 --> 03:10:21.849
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you. They can't.
The PES we can work with them, right.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/840-5
03:10:21.849 --> 03:10:25.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We may not be able to change everything
in day one, but we can.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/841-0
03:10:25.335 --> 03:10:28.726
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And work with them that they take that
and put that into the form.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/841-1
03:10:28.726 --> 03:10:31.206
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And if that seems to be forward enough
for them,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/841-2
03:10:31.206 --> 03:10:35.053
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they're not having to do ex sales,
they're not having to Add all that stuff</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/841-3
03:10:35.053 --> 03:10:39.102
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and you're just replacing that for that.
That's where we need to put our focus,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/841-4
03:10:39.102 --> 03:10:42.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think particularly for a new one,
even if you're half in the labour.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/842-0
03:10:43.575 --> 03:10:45.994
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah,
because it sounds like you're having to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/842-1
03:10:45.994 --> 03:10:50.252
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>do the heavy lifting on the back of that,
particularly if they scrolled over the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/842-2
03:10:50.252 --> 03:10:54.090
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>bit of information that you needed to
read, you know, over on the train,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/842-3
03:10:54.090 --> 03:10:56.561
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's sort of like a journey you get,
you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/842-4
03:10:56.561 --> 03:10:59.347
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>based on where you're starting from. Like,
you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/842-5
03:10:59.347 --> 03:11:01.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that whole could have meet people where
they are.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/843-0
03:11:02.375 --> 03:11:05.007
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You you if you got everybody on the
spreadsheet,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/843-1
03:11:05.007 --> 03:11:09.410
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that would be a leap and then you can go
for the spreadsheet to the form you know</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/843-2
03:11:09.410 --> 03:11:11.934
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and then you could. But yeah,
it's baby steps.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/843-3
03:11:11.934 --> 03:11:14.673
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think culture of change. Yeah,
it's set to mark.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/843-4
03:11:14.673 --> 03:11:19.077
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think for me it is more about I don't
make an error because we have made errors</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/843-5
03:11:19.077 --> 03:11:21.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>on on those because we have missed out or
we have.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/844-0
03:11:21.935 --> 03:11:25.480
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Not done what would have been the final
scribbling on on the piece.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/844-1
03:11:25.480 --> 03:11:28.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So that's where I'm coming from.
The how can I since?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/845-0
03:11:27.055 --> 03:11:30.108
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, well,
because sorry Parrot Parrot's got his</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/845-1
03:11:30.108 --> 03:11:31.695
<v Mark Sedge>hand up. Go ahead, parrot.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/846-0
03:11:32.415 --> 03:11:34.943
<v Parik Narain>It's just a few ideas to float around
right.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/846-1
03:11:34.943 --> 03:11:39.324
<v Parik Narain>I mean then in in my one of my previous
previous project where we had to face</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/846-2
03:11:39.324 --> 03:11:42.974
<v Parik Narain>similar issues, right.
Legal teams are very similar in most most</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/846-3
03:11:42.974 --> 03:11:47.242
<v Parik Narain>most firms and the way they behave
because it stays the way of you know Wet</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/846-4
03:11:47.242 --> 03:11:51.735
<v Parik Narain>Wet ink on paper kind of attitudes what
we kind of gave a few general counsels.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/848-0
03:11:51.775 --> 03:11:54.618
<v Parik Narain>It was and again,
something to discover is a collaboration</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/848-1
03:11:54.618 --> 03:11:57.749
<v Parik Narain>channel on teams, right?
So what they do they did was to because</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/848-2
03:11:57.749 --> 03:12:00.688
<v Parik Narain>teams is on the mobile phone teams,
is accessible regularly.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/848-3
03:12:00.688 --> 03:12:03.290
<v Parik Narain>These individual channels were for the
work for them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/848-4
03:12:03.290 --> 03:12:07.095
<v Parik Narain>So they used to put updates on based on
the case references and marked number.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/850-0
03:12:07.535 --> 03:12:11.173
<v Parik Narain>They are directly so into 100 notes.
We kind of gave them a team's channel,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/850-1
03:12:11.173 --> 03:12:14.667
<v Parik Narain>which is only for them a private channel
and then we integrate that with</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/850-2
03:12:14.667 --> 03:12:17.156
<v Parik Narain>ServiceNow to kind of update the cases
accordingly.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/850-3
03:12:17.156 --> 03:12:21.176
<v Parik Narain>So we did not ask them to actually go on
service now and update them. We told them,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/850-4
03:12:21.176 --> 03:12:23.282
<v Parik Narain>hey,
obviously paper is something we can't,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/850-5
03:12:23.282 --> 03:12:25.819
<v Parik Narain>you know,
import into a digital format quite easily.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/850-6
03:12:25.819 --> 03:12:27.015
<v Parik Narain>So we give you a channel.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/852-0
03:12:27.455 --> 03:12:30.987
<v Parik Narain>There was a training involved, etcetera,
but channels became quite popular.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/849-0
03:12:27.775 --> 03:12:28.015
<v Mark Sedge>But.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/855-0
03:12:30.975 --> 03:12:35.058
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, parrot the my. I think.
I think the thing to be mindful there is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/852-1
03:12:30.987 --> 03:12:33.495
<v Parik Narain>So we're going to look at these kind of
things, yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/855-1
03:12:35.058 --> 03:12:39.600
<v Mark Sedge>it's still when someone's scrolling
something. No disrespect to their writing,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/855-2
03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:43.683
<v Mark Sedge>but they're still to Sandy's point the
risk of error because you don't</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/853-0
03:12:43.055 --> 03:12:43.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>S.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/855-3
03:12:43.683 --> 03:12:47.535
<v Mark Sedge>understand it's not clear whereas if
you're doing it systemically.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/858-0
03:12:47.935 --> 03:12:51.869
<v Mark Sedge>You can usually by process rule out your
error rate and that's what I think</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/854-0
03:12:48.095 --> 03:12:48.455
<v Parik Narain>Correct.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/858-1
03:12:51.869 --> 03:12:55.026
<v Mark Sedge>Sandeep trying to target is how does he
eradicate his error?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/856-0
03:12:54.775 --> 03:12:54.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/858-2
03:12:55.026 --> 03:12:58.494
<v Mark Sedge>Note again Sandeep just checked,
I've understood that that's your.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/858-3
03:12:58.494 --> 03:13:00.615
<v Mark Sedge>That's what you're driving for, isn't it?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/857-0
03:13:00.775 --> 03:13:01.895
<v Parik Narain>Yeah. Yeah, so.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/859-0
03:13:00.895 --> 03:13:03.769
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, that that, that's true.
And and the point,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/859-1
03:13:03.769 --> 03:13:07.639
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what Alex and Jill made is,
is is more about our process like us,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/859-2
03:13:07.639 --> 03:13:12.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we can't change or we won't change their
habit day one. You know. Yep. Yep.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/860-0
03:13:13.215 --> 03:13:16.973
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, there's a change element there.
So I think it took us about a couple of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/860-1
03:13:16.973 --> 03:13:20.827
<v Parik Narain>months to kind of move move a majority
population away from from paper on paper</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/860-2
03:13:20.827 --> 03:13:23.718
<v Parik Narain>and pen to at least a collaboration
channel based approach.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/860-3
03:13:23.718 --> 03:13:26.897
<v Parik Narain>So something to look at,
you know where there are tools available</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/860-4
03:13:26.897 --> 03:13:30.125
<v Parik Narain>and not just ServiceNow,
others which we can integrate with to get</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/860-5
03:13:30.125 --> 03:13:33.015
<v Parik Narain>that detail and to make life a little
easier for everybody.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/861-0
03:13:33.055 --> 03:13:35.895
<v Parik Narain>He was doing diligence on top of those,
those details.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/862-0
03:13:35.215 --> 03:13:39.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But if we could, if we could see them,
that would be great. OK, her face.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/863-0
03:13:42.615 --> 03:13:42.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>None.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/864-0
03:13:44.695 --> 03:13:48.188
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I've got my other types.
I mean this was meant to be simple</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/864-1
03:13:48.188 --> 03:13:51.040
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>managed.
We haven't got the complex billing yet,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/864-2
03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:53.659
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but I mean there it's straightforward.
Look,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/864-3
03:13:53.659 --> 03:13:57.908
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there's all scenarios of your your
raising and we just want to make that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/864-4
03:13:57.908 --> 03:14:01.691
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>workload easy for you.
And I've got I've got sort of three other</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/864-5
03:14:01.691 --> 03:14:04.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>things. I've got reissue there's probably.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/865-0
03:14:05.095 --> 03:14:10.115
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>On there as well is that now is that part
of again a query or is it something based?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/865-1
03:14:10.115 --> 03:14:15.076
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean your happy path actually is hasn't
been touched at the moment we haven't got</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/865-2
03:14:15.076 --> 03:14:19.091
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>subsequent issues from it,
but it's reissue a query that you get or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/865-3
03:14:19.091 --> 03:14:23.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is something that you generate off the
back of when you're processing invoices?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/866-0
03:14:24.855 --> 03:14:28.872
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Again, just yeah,
as part of what the request coming in now</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/866-1
03:14:28.872 --> 03:14:34.429
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as part of our sort of generally be part
of a the cancellation sort of cancel. Oh,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/866-2
03:14:34.429 --> 03:14:38.982
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is it part of the cancellation,
OK that we discussed earlier. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/866-3
03:14:38.982 --> 03:14:40.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK if if we cancelled it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/867-0
03:14:41.695 --> 03:14:44.486
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know first and then they come back a
week later.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/867-1
03:14:44.486 --> 03:14:48.488
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's a reissue we would we would class
that as a new invoice request really</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/867-2
03:14:48.488 --> 03:14:51.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because it'd probably be a new ticket
etcetera.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/867-3
03:14:51.015 --> 03:14:53.490
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So would is there education that you know,
OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/867-4
03:14:53.490 --> 03:14:57.597
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they've been informed of can't I mean
they could give you the but essentially</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/867-5
03:14:57.597 --> 03:15:00.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you're processing it, processing it.
If it was new.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/868-0
03:15:00.695 --> 03:15:04.160
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. Yeah, it's actually,
you're back at scratch because you've</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/868-1
03:15:04.160 --> 03:15:07.358
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we've said that for the cancellation,
it's closed complete.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/868-2
03:15:07.358 --> 03:15:11.142
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's come off because they're going to do
a might not be a week later,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/868-3
03:15:11.142 --> 03:15:14.126
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it might be X amount of time. Yeah,
they're just. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/868-4
03:15:14.126 --> 03:15:18.390
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's the language that it is reissued.
Do they tend to do reissue on that or is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/868-5
03:15:18.390 --> 03:15:20.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it just a new? It would just be a new.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/869-0
03:15:20.495 --> 03:15:25.324
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Request really. OK. All right. Perfect.
And then just go through that that we've</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/869-1
03:15:25.324 --> 03:15:29.915
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>discussed. I've got these 3 E workflows.
I think they're a bit further down.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/869-2
03:15:29.915 --> 03:15:34.803
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Maybe I've just sort of saw them as and
we've probably already touched upon them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/869-3
03:15:34.803 --> 03:15:39.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is there one other below? There's a three,
yeah, there's three of them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/870-0
03:15:39.535 --> 03:15:43.909
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>This simple billing three EI think that's
maybe we've touched upon.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/870-1
03:15:43.909 --> 03:15:48.862
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's the cheques that you're doing
anyway that we've seen in in them we've</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/870-2
03:15:48.862 --> 03:15:52.142
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>got third party client invoice 3E work
for client.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/870-3
03:15:52.142 --> 03:15:57.159
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know there was a combination of
processes in there I thought are they all</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/870-4
03:15:57.159 --> 03:15:58.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>one of the same that we've.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/871-0
03:15:58.935 --> 03:16:03.153
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We've already discussed this morning
because we're doing the three cheques</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/871-1
03:16:03.153 --> 03:16:05.740
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>well.
There's ones that are already generated</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/871-2
03:16:05.740 --> 03:16:08.327
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>in three that don't come to you with
queries.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/871-3
03:16:08.327 --> 03:16:12.882
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The first two are would be I think we're
we've told them to go back and generate</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/871-4
03:16:12.882 --> 03:16:15.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it through the the 3E workflow exactly
where it, yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/871-5
03:16:15.975 --> 03:16:18.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because it lives and breathes in the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/872-0
03:16:19.095 --> 03:16:22.008
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yes, yeah.
And then I'm not sure why that's got.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/872-1
03:16:22.008 --> 03:16:26.584
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think the last one is I think that's
just probably saying that's a sort of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/872-2
03:16:26.584 --> 03:16:29.377
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>request that may come through sheer well,
yes,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/872-3
03:16:29.377 --> 03:16:34.251
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because we would use that category direct
request or it may also come through the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/872-4
03:16:34.251 --> 03:16:37.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they were the two options that we've
discussed earlier. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/873-0
03:16:38.695 --> 03:16:42.103
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You wouldn't even touch chair world today.
OK, perfect. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/873-1
03:16:42.103 --> 03:16:46.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I just know that this is scheduled on
there. GAIL, are they scheduled cases?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/874-0
03:16:49.375 --> 03:16:51.559
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think that was initially captured,
but I can check.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/874-1
03:16:51.559 --> 03:16:53.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'll check just now what we've bought.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/875-0
03:16:54.775 --> 03:16:57.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sorry, just carry on. It was just, yeah,
up there, OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/876-0
03:17:01.175 --> 03:17:07.673
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The other thing actually I wrote it and
retainer. There's two additional ones now.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/876-1
03:17:07.673 --> 03:17:13.623
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>How do they come into you? Right.
Why do we get 2 retainer? Yeah. OK. Well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/876-2
03:17:13.623 --> 03:17:15.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>this is the problem as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/877-0
03:17:16.415 --> 03:17:17.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean retainer billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/878-0
03:17:19.855 --> 03:17:19.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Uh.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/880-0
03:17:21.735 --> 03:17:25.666
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We probably we have got that category.
Sometimes they'll make it quite clear</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/880-1
03:17:25.666 --> 03:17:29.189
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that it's a retainer bill,
other times they send a request in and it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/880-2
03:17:29.189 --> 03:17:30.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>probably is retainer building, but.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/881-0
03:17:32.295 --> 03:17:36.705
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But we wouldn't be aware of it.
So detainer billing could just be the big</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/881-1
03:17:36.705 --> 03:17:41.234
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>now agreed we're going to Bill 10,
000 a month for the next year and that's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/881-2
03:17:41.234 --> 03:17:44.094
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what's agreed with the client, right?
Yeah. OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/881-3
03:17:44.094 --> 03:17:48.027
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And there's a standard request of what
you're going to pay. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/881-4
03:17:48.027 --> 03:17:49.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there's not really anything.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/882-0
03:17:51.695 --> 03:17:55.092
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Does that happen in 3E or where are they
generating that?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/882-1
03:17:55.092 --> 03:17:59.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Does that come in as queries?
It could come in again in both ways.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/882-2
03:17:59.015 --> 03:18:02.820
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It could come in through 3E,
and because it is generally quite a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/882-3
03:18:02.820 --> 03:18:06.217
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>simple bill in most cases,
I'm thinking does it does that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/882-4
03:18:06.217 --> 03:18:09.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>information be captured there?
Is that something a bit?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/883-0
03:18:10.255 --> 03:18:14.321
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I know it was a detainer.
I think at the time we had that category</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/883-1
03:18:14.321 --> 03:18:17.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just to try and see if we can keep an eye
on them,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/883-2
03:18:17.415 --> 03:18:21.237
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but I would say we probably do lots of
retainer bills as part,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/883-3
03:18:21.237 --> 03:18:26.212
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it doesn't actually see anywhere that
that's what the agreement is because we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/883-4
03:18:26.212 --> 03:18:30.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>don't really need to know.
So if they just constantly each one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/884-0
03:18:30.175 --> 03:18:34.211
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sent a request for matter X for 10,000.
You can just spell it. OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/884-1
03:18:34.211 --> 03:18:38.125
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so they're just interrupting. Yeah,
there's nothing, really. OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/884-2
03:18:38.125 --> 03:18:42.943
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that makes sense because I was thinking
that that's probably where it lives and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/884-3
03:18:42.943 --> 03:18:46.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>breathes. Yeah, another one.
Money on account. That's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/885-0
03:18:47.295 --> 03:18:51.276
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Process.
We don't really do because it's not great.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/885-1
03:18:51.276 --> 03:18:56.099
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, under the SRA.
But we keep that category just because we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/885-2
03:18:56.099 --> 03:19:02.300
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>get we quite often get requests for them
and an occasion we can work around with</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/885-3
03:19:02.300 --> 03:19:03.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>approval fee.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/886-0
03:19:03.975 --> 03:19:09.163
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Mark here but the CFO, but we just,
we've always just kept that category just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/886-1
03:19:09.163 --> 03:19:14.283
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so we can look back and basically find
out when we've been asked to do them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/886-2
03:19:14.283 --> 03:19:18.273
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So you do get asked,
yeah quite often does it often enough,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/886-3
03:19:18.273 --> 03:19:20.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but not like you know maybe.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/887-0
03:19:21.535 --> 03:19:24.665
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Maybe not.
Maybe when someone fit them or oh, OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/887-1
03:19:24.665 --> 03:19:27.606
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.
And is it something that proactively can</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/887-2
03:19:27.606 --> 03:19:32.675
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>be done in 3 E or is it something that
you have to do is I'm just thinking of an</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/887-3
03:19:32.675 --> 03:19:36.806
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>educational piece of push of why you get
them, are they reactive?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/887-4
03:19:36.806 --> 03:19:38.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's generally where looks.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/888-0
03:19:39.975 --> 03:19:44.237
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>A client wants to maybe put money into
client account and you've got certain</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/888-1
03:19:44.237 --> 03:19:47.613
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ones and they say,
but we want an invoice and you can't give</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/888-2
03:19:47.613 --> 03:19:51.986
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>an invoice for money's come into client
account if we've not actually done any</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/888-3
03:19:51.986 --> 03:19:53.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>illegal work yet. So it's a.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/889-0
03:19:54.255 --> 03:19:59.371
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There's a breach SRE because how the
money's come in if it goes to the wrong</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/889-1
03:19:59.371 --> 03:20:04.421
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>if it goes to the business account as any
money for an actual invoice would</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/889-2
03:20:04.421 --> 03:20:09.403
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>automatically then we've breached.
But it's just like a lot of clients ask</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/889-3
03:20:09.403 --> 03:20:12.460
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>for it.
So there's the odd occasion we've had</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/889-4
03:20:12.460 --> 03:20:13.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>been able to make.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/890-0
03:20:13.655 --> 03:20:14.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You can accept.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/891-0
03:20:14.335 --> 03:20:17.863
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>In between building cashiers and
everybody gets involved to make sure it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/891-1
03:20:17.863 --> 03:20:21.776
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>doesn't go into the business account.
Yeah, we've talked about that again. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/891-2
03:20:21.776 --> 03:20:25.062
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the policy. And it's only like,
if Mark here but gets the go ahead.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/891-3
03:20:25.062 --> 03:20:27.574
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And it really does.
But there has been no occasion.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/891-4
03:20:27.574 --> 03:20:30.087
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I wonder if we capture that rather than
officiated.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/891-5
03:20:30.087 --> 03:20:33.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It becomes part of the general query.
Yeah. It's really is. It's not. Really.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/892-0
03:20:35.535 --> 03:20:40.288
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK. Yeah. Just going back very quickly.
Sorry I checked the schedule case. No,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/892-1
03:20:40.288 --> 03:20:44.920
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it doesn't look to be you've only got 1
schedule case which thinks daily RTB</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/892-2
03:20:44.920 --> 03:20:48.048
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>report. Yeah,
I think we've got reports here. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/892-3
03:20:48.048 --> 03:20:50.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we've got a report section that comes up.
Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/893-0
03:20:52.655 --> 03:20:55.921
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sundry.
I think there was some sundry which I</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/893-1
03:20:55.921 --> 03:21:01.317
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>thought that's probably a science in
itself. It's at the very bottom. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/893-2
03:21:01.317 --> 03:21:05.932
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's for clients. Yeah. Billing. Yeah.
That's for things like,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/893-3
03:21:05.932 --> 03:21:09.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just see if there was any seminars held
or.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/894-0
03:21:10.415 --> 03:21:15.152
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sometimes it's an office catering.
You know what, more? London office.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/894-1
03:21:15.152 --> 03:21:20.556
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think we've been out one of the floors,
so it's not any legal client building,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/894-2
03:21:20.556 --> 03:21:25.293
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we have to issue an invoice.
So we have sundry matters set up, OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/894-3
03:21:25.293 --> 03:21:29.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And where we just go in and we who raises
that, that could be.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/895-0
03:21:29.575 --> 03:21:33.936
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Anybody that raises up to you. Yeah. Yeah,
it can. It tends to be, yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/895-1
03:21:33.936 --> 03:21:37.341
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it tends to be the same sort of a
departments. But yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/895-2
03:21:37.341 --> 03:21:41.761
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>MD could technically ask for it. OK.
And so they don't do that in, sorry.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/895-3
03:21:41.761 --> 03:21:44.091
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Carry on.
So just just a little bit of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/895-4
03:21:44.091 --> 03:21:47.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>clarification between billing and
accounts payable then.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/896-0
03:21:47.815 --> 03:21:52.315
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So is it just you are generating the
draught of that invoice?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/896-1
03:21:52.315 --> 03:21:57.395
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sorry the PDF of the invoice and then you
go to AP for clearance. No,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/896-2
03:21:57.395 --> 03:22:00.589
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we just issued the invoice for whatever
SC.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/896-3
03:22:00.589 --> 03:22:06.467
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If it was like now whatever the one is
seminar whatever and who we're billing it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/896-4
03:22:06.467 --> 03:22:06.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to and.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/897-0
03:22:07.295 --> 03:22:11.067
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The the provider GL account and when we
let so This Is Us, yes,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/897-1
03:22:11.067 --> 03:22:15.605
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we are issuing an invoice to to gosh,
I'm trying to think who the ones look.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/897-2
03:22:15.605 --> 03:22:20.202
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There's one like an event company or yes.
Yeah. They're not an actual client.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/897-3
03:22:20.202 --> 03:22:23.149
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we do ones every month an actual
client. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/897-4
03:22:23.149 --> 03:22:27.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>For the London Office because I think we
went out one of the floors.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/898-0
03:22:27.335 --> 03:22:30.448
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Right. OK.
So it's like the sundry bills go out.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/898-1
03:22:30.448 --> 03:22:33.306
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's from like the heat and the
electricity.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/898-2
03:22:33.306 --> 03:22:36.100
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So why is it not sitting with the
accounts?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/898-3
03:22:36.100 --> 03:22:41.435
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But I think accounts those heat electric,
they mentioned those utility based ones I</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/898-4
03:22:41.435 --> 03:22:43.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>think yeah, I think this is ones we are.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/899-0
03:22:45.215 --> 03:22:45.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Look for your.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/900-0
03:22:47.575 --> 03:22:51.838
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So what I was trying to think is that is
that because of a client and then it has</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/900-1
03:22:51.838 --> 03:22:55.112
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to go from client activity.
You know for whatever it might be.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/900-2
03:22:55.112 --> 03:22:58.075
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And so they tend to come,
it's old and it's not clients.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/900-3
03:22:58.075 --> 03:23:02.389
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We're not an actual client if I was but
but it becomes a pure office expense then.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/900-4
03:23:02.389 --> 03:23:04.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So why would you do it and not accounts
payable?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/901-0
03:23:06.975 --> 03:23:12.228
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's I'm trying to think how you've got
an opportunity to pass it now to yes. No,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/901-1
03:23:12.228 --> 03:23:17.481
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's because we need to issue them and it
goes against the gaol because we issue,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/901-2
03:23:17.481 --> 03:23:22.093
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we're sending an invoice out to them and
then we let the accounts team,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/901-3
03:23:22.093 --> 03:23:25.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>financial management accounts and
important team.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/902-0
03:23:25.855 --> 03:23:30.607
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We whoever requests it has to provide the
GL code for it to then go against once</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/902-1
03:23:30.607 --> 03:23:33.833
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the money's come in.
And then I think it maybe goes to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/902-2
03:23:33.833 --> 03:23:36.883
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>accounts payable.
Can we investigate that that it's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/902-3
03:23:36.883 --> 03:23:41.048
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>something that we can, Simon,
can we put that on the service catalogue</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/902-4
03:23:41.048 --> 03:23:41.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>piece to?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/903-0
03:23:42.015 --> 03:23:46.400
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Have a look because you're going to
pigment just for the GL code because they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/903-1
03:23:46.400 --> 03:23:50.278
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>manage the list of GL code,
so that's purely going to that team from</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/903-2
03:23:50.278 --> 03:23:53.201
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>an information perspective,
they won't do anything,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/903-3
03:23:53.201 --> 03:23:56.967
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but I think my opinion. Yep,
the event say you have done an event,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/903-4
03:23:56.967 --> 03:24:01.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the event should be raising an invoice
going to AP directly and then AP managing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/904-0
03:24:01.655 --> 03:24:03.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That payments and everything.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/905-0
03:24:05.055 --> 03:24:07.819
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Can I check what's the? What's the what?
Sorry.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/905-1
03:24:07.819 --> 03:24:11.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Can I check something from from Wednesday
with Cashiering?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/905-2
03:24:11.215 --> 03:24:13.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They did sundry invoice creation as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/906-0
03:24:15.775 --> 03:24:18.246
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>When they got into the manager invoice
piece.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/906-1
03:24:18.246 --> 03:24:22.167
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I'm trying to think the other examples.
I guess it is a rear as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/906-2
03:24:22.167 --> 03:24:25.229
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's not much,
not not many invoices because I think the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/906-3
03:24:25.229 --> 03:24:29.580
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>money because I think there's a case it's
been a big seminar that it's coming to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/906-4
03:24:29.580 --> 03:24:30.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and maybe if there's a.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/907-0
03:24:31.375 --> 03:24:34.310
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>A course to attend it,
and we'll send the invoice.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/907-1
03:24:34.310 --> 03:24:38.568
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We'll provide the invoices I think.
I think it's something for them to be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/907-2
03:24:38.568 --> 03:24:41.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>able to.
I think it depends like an alignment</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/907-3
03:24:41.215 --> 03:24:44.782
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>piece that something you should be, yeah.
Suspected presents.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/907-4
03:24:44.782 --> 03:24:46.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It should not sit with you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/908-0
03:24:46.775 --> 03:24:46.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/909-0
03:24:49.655 --> 03:24:54.488
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Because yours is purely client, right?
So it should be all client billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/909-1
03:24:54.488 --> 03:24:57.581
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It should.
Anything else should be but this is,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/909-2
03:24:57.581 --> 03:25:01.834
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but this is the one that is non client
billing. Yeah, yeah, yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/909-3
03:25:01.834 --> 03:25:05.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I will check on the caches pieces. Well,
Tim and.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/910-0
03:25:06.655 --> 03:25:10.662
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And we we put that down as a general
query as well. I've got it on the board.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/910-1
03:25:10.662 --> 03:25:13.179
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, I've got it as a general query.
Thank you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/910-2
03:25:13.179 --> 03:25:16.209
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm just going to check before we move on
to the next one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/910-3
03:25:16.209 --> 03:25:20.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm aware that we are said that we would
finish at 1:30. We might be able to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/911-0
03:25:22.615 --> 03:25:27.832
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>PO Edit I think was we discussed at the
beginning that it might be part of the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/911-1
03:25:27.832 --> 03:25:32.982
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>actions that you is that correct that
part of the invoicing you might request</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/911-2
03:25:32.982 --> 03:25:38.397
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that it needs to be to whip or needs to
edit on it etcetera or is that were there</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/911-3
03:25:38.397 --> 03:25:40.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>any update additional activities?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/912-0
03:25:41.295 --> 03:25:44.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Let me just find where it was and then
we've done making pro formas.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/912-1
03:25:44.935 --> 03:25:48.997
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't making, sorry pro forma edits.
I think we discussed not PO edits and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/912-2
03:25:48.997 --> 03:25:53.058
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's just slipping. Yeah, yeah. Well,
quite often if they've created a pro</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/912-3
03:25:53.058 --> 03:25:56.750
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>forma and they no longer want it or they
might want to run a new one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/912-4
03:25:56.750 --> 03:26:00.337
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So they'll get requests.
And can you make it dormant? Yep, Yep. OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/912-5
03:26:00.337 --> 03:26:00.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/913-0
03:26:01.295 --> 03:26:06.371
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sort of quick win. Yep.
I think we've done those lots of the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/913-1
03:26:06.371 --> 03:26:10.628
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Let me just check maybe the draught
invoice review.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/913-2
03:26:10.628 --> 03:26:17.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think it does that come upstream for
those. I know that we've got this GNGM.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/914-0
03:26:17.775 --> 03:26:18.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>PFA.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/915-0
03:26:19.855 --> 03:26:24.772
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is that the stuff that we were talking
about that you review the Christie's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/915-1
03:26:24.772 --> 03:26:27.618
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>stuff?
Is that the pro forma is the initial</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/915-2
03:26:27.618 --> 03:26:32.987
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>draught invoice the pro forma or are they
separate they would because what we have</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/915-3
03:26:32.987 --> 03:26:38.356
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>one is the working members as as classed
as PFA practise finance assistant for the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/915-4
03:26:38.356 --> 03:26:39.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>investment funds.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/916-0
03:26:39.655 --> 03:26:43.459
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Right.
So he picks up all the billing and the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/916-1
03:26:43.459 --> 03:26:48.006
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the arrangement is with some of the other
departments,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/916-2
03:26:48.006 --> 03:26:54.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the same processes the PES would do with
investment funds all comes to us in.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/917-0
03:26:54.855 --> 03:26:57.574
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>He, like he would action them.
So if they want,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/917-1
03:26:57.574 --> 03:27:01.651
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just like a basic draught invoice,
he's doing that activity that the PE</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/917-2
03:27:01.651 --> 03:27:04.426
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>would do but officiated under this PFA
activity.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/917-3
03:27:04.426 --> 03:27:08.163
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So those draught invoice pro forma,
the things that we discussed,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/917-4
03:27:08.163 --> 03:27:12.523
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's what they will be doing. OK.
So that's something that can be auto are</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/917-5
03:27:12.523 --> 03:27:14.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>saying to him that has ruled in.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/918-0
03:27:14.615 --> 03:27:18.736
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. Yeah. But I think we've got,
we've got a subcategory for those.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/918-1
03:27:18.736 --> 03:27:22.150
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we could go through them. OK.
We've done credit bills.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/918-2
03:27:22.150 --> 03:27:25.152
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Just go to the top for me.
I think that's reissue,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/918-3
03:27:25.152 --> 03:27:28.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we discussed reissue issue third party
payer, OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/919-0
03:27:28.455 --> 03:27:28.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/920-0
03:27:31.135 --> 03:27:31.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's good.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/922-0
03:27:36.935 --> 03:27:41.681
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Edit Pro formas we've got quite a few.
We've captured a lot of those scenarios.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/922-1
03:27:41.681 --> 03:27:45.062
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean this is the as is we've been
talking to it today.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/922-2
03:27:45.062 --> 03:27:48.383
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's certainly not what we're then taking
to systemize.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/922-3
03:27:48.383 --> 03:27:53.128
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's it's taking a lot of that stuff that
we said we've got actually that happy</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/922-4
03:27:53.128 --> 03:27:55.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>path wasn't challenged too much apart
from the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/923-0
03:27:56.095 --> 03:28:00.726
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The whip and credit control that will
pick it up as those steps or the reversal</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/923-1
03:28:00.726 --> 03:28:04.431
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of the cancellations.
So that was with I think the probably the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/923-2
03:28:04.431 --> 03:28:08.945
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>one that I was thinking about was that
storage of that when you generate that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/923-3
03:28:08.945 --> 03:28:11.550
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that PDF and then notifications back to
the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/923-4
03:28:11.550 --> 03:28:15.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So that's something ServiceNow will do,
it sends it back to the request.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/924-0
03:28:15.895 --> 03:28:20.932
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So if the PE just to close off that loop
when you have completed them,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/924-1
03:28:20.932 --> 03:28:24.266
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the whoever requested it,
you know they could.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/924-2
03:28:24.266 --> 03:28:29.800
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It could be the PE on behalf of the
partner and that could be captured at the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/924-3
03:28:29.800 --> 03:28:32.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>upfront request and query, but the PE?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/925-0
03:28:33.215 --> 03:28:37.930
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We'll get that information with the
attached invoice that we discussed and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/925-1
03:28:37.930 --> 03:28:41.450
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then as we said,
officiating that those hand scrolling,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/925-2
03:28:41.450 --> 03:28:46.101
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know, getting copies of that,
can we then move on to then the PF just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/925-3
03:28:46.101 --> 03:28:51.381
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>have a look at the PFA activity to see if
it's what we've already discussed for the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/925-4
03:28:51.381 --> 03:28:52.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>PE. So on the TMRT.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/926-0
03:28:52.655 --> 03:28:57.596
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If you I'm a recommendation,
I think I did put APFA section and then</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/926-1
03:28:57.596 --> 03:28:59.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we can go into complex billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/927-0
03:29:02.135 --> 03:29:07.322
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There's there's a few of these,
and I think just to check that they've</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/927-1
03:29:07.322 --> 03:29:12.801
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>got editing phase and tasks now.
Is that something that you that this role</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/927-2
03:29:12.801 --> 03:29:17.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is doing under billing and or is that
something that's outside of?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/928-0
03:29:18.255 --> 03:29:23.086
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is is it activities that they're doing in
three or the things that come on the back</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/928-1
03:29:23.086 --> 03:29:27.917
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of the queries that you get in billing is
is probably what I'm asking. Yeah, again,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/928-2
03:29:27.917 --> 03:29:32.172
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the the withdrawal just come in. Yeah,
as an an e-mail and tours are they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/928-3
03:29:32.172 --> 03:29:36.198
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>general queries or are they fish?
Are they particular activities that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/928-4
03:29:36.198 --> 03:29:37.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you're expecting?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/929-0
03:29:37.535 --> 03:29:41.163
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So packs,
I think there's task codes invoice update</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/929-1
03:29:41.163 --> 03:29:44.441
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>call.
There seems to be that some of them like</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/929-2
03:29:44.441 --> 03:29:47.580
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the weekly update call is a scheduled
event,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/929-3
03:29:47.580 --> 03:29:53.229
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know rather than a query that's been
raised by somebody that they're because</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/929-4
03:29:53.229 --> 03:29:57.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>this is for managing the level of
activities and tasks.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/930-0
03:29:57.215 --> 03:30:01.067
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You're doing on behalf of someone else,
so I'm just checking that these aren't</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/930-1
03:30:01.067 --> 03:30:04.869
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the their roles and responsibilities that
they're doing as part of their role</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/930-2
03:30:04.869 --> 03:30:06.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>rather than on the back of a query.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/931-0
03:30:08.215 --> 03:30:11.708
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Because it looks like it's doing notary
tracking,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/931-1
03:30:11.708 --> 03:30:16.039
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>global markets end to end processes.
Does the Notary 1 still?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/931-2
03:30:16.039 --> 03:30:19.811
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Or whether these are is me that does
you're that one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/931-3
03:30:19.811 --> 03:30:25.330
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I think there's some of these tasks
originally where PFA and no they're not</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/931-4
03:30:25.330 --> 03:30:27.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>right. So any ones that are IF.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/932-0
03:30:28.975 --> 03:30:33.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Basically that have IF somewhere or
investment funds they are all still PFA,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/932-1
03:30:33.855 --> 03:30:38.544
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but the ones that are GM so delighted
that I think I was hoping that you,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/932-2
03:30:38.544 --> 03:30:42.536
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is there another one?
Is there an oh look at the left hand I'm</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/932-3
03:30:42.536 --> 03:30:45.832
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>looking in.
I was looking at the left hand so there</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/932-4
03:30:45.832 --> 03:30:46.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>are a couple.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/933-0
03:30:47.095 --> 03:30:50.275
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There's 1/2,
so there's they remain with you in their</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/933-1
03:30:50.275 --> 03:30:54.278
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing. Yes, they are PFA.
They're still part of the billing team,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/933-2
03:30:54.278 --> 03:30:57.928
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but they are specific to that. OK.
But it comes into billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/933-3
03:30:57.928 --> 03:31:01.579
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So the weekly invoice,
that's an activity that they do rather</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/933-4
03:31:01.579 --> 03:31:05.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>than a query on the back of it,
is that correct image should get started.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/934-0
03:31:06.375 --> 03:31:11.318
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It wouldn't if it's not actually 100%,
should. If you no longer still do that,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/934-1
03:31:11.318 --> 03:31:15.134
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it will just be, yeah,
it will be something that's scheduled</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/934-2
03:31:15.134 --> 03:31:18.513
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that. Yeah.
And did you want to capture that? I mean,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/934-3
03:31:18.513 --> 03:31:21.579
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>a bit like the one that we talked about
earlier,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/934-4
03:31:21.579 --> 03:31:25.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>which is a scheduled call that you have
and that you're officiating.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/935-0
03:31:26.095 --> 03:31:26.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Outcomes.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/936-0
03:31:26.695 --> 03:31:29.277
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Of it? Or is it?
Is it tend to be a calendar event?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/936-1
03:31:29.277 --> 03:31:32.951
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sometimes in this week we've captured so
that they remain a task on their</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/936-2
03:31:32.951 --> 03:31:36.824
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>dashboard that they know that they're
doing, rather than it being in outlook.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/936-3
03:31:36.824 --> 03:31:40.746
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's something that's scheduled that
they're do they're doing and there is the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/936-4
03:31:40.746 --> 03:31:44.023
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>outcomes on the back of it that you need
to know. So for example,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/936-5
03:31:44.023 --> 03:31:46.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you might say to him,
you know during that call.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/937-0
03:31:46.655 --> 03:31:49.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What? What was your findings?
They could be captured and reported upon.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/938-0
03:31:52.255 --> 03:31:55.658
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You have to decide that now.
Maybe that will just that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/938-1
03:31:55.658 --> 03:31:59.486
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I want you just check.
I'm not 100% sure on this weekly update</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/938-2
03:31:59.486 --> 03:32:02.341
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>call.
Maybe follow up and see if that actually</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/938-3
03:32:02.341 --> 03:32:07.263
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>yeah that one actually or the outcome of
the purpose of it weekly invoice update</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/938-4
03:32:07.263 --> 03:32:08.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>call that sounds.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/939-0
03:32:09.095 --> 03:32:12.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Like something,
but you will do as a department maybe.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/940-0
03:32:14.935 --> 03:32:18.780
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Just seems a bit weird to have that as a
yeah, yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/940-1
03:32:18.780 --> 03:32:23.640
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there was a few changes like with the
investment funds in the PFE.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/940-2
03:32:23.640 --> 03:32:28.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What what Christa did originally and
maybe we did move some things away.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/940-3
03:32:28.935 --> 03:32:30.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I'm not sure.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/941-0
03:32:30.895 --> 03:32:35.454
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I know one point because he used to hunt
to fit in part of that he used to run a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/941-1
03:32:35.454 --> 03:32:39.394
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>sort of whip report for them,
which then moved to the whip management</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/941-2
03:32:39.394 --> 03:32:41.870
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>team.
But I don't know if that OK been part</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/941-3
03:32:41.870 --> 03:32:45.303
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that might be the whip management.
That's fine, Simon. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/941-4
03:32:45.303 --> 03:32:46.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'll get checked that, Simon.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/942-0
03:32:49.095 --> 03:32:51.293
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sorry,
it's a process documentation for this.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/942-1
03:32:51.293 --> 03:32:54.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Can we understand what that process
actually looks like?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/943-0
03:32:55.895 --> 03:32:58.482
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, we can.
We can part that one and just yeah</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/943-1
03:32:58.482 --> 03:33:00.910
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>officiate.
I can also run a quick search from</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/943-2
03:33:00.910 --> 03:33:05.028
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sharewell and see if there's anything
categorised using that one just to kind</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/943-3
03:33:05.028 --> 03:33:08.195
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of see what. Yeah,
but if you don't recognise that you know</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/943-4
03:33:08.195 --> 03:33:12.312
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's not but it can be look a bit like
the other one that could be officiated</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/943-5
03:33:12.312 --> 03:33:15.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and the outcomes reported upon well it
makes sense to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/944-0
03:33:15.575 --> 03:33:18.819
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Stress does it and you know,
will it make sense to him, do you think?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/944-1
03:33:18.819 --> 03:33:21.043
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah,
I think we just get heads and foot on it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/944-2
03:33:21.043 --> 03:33:24.194
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, I think it's useful. Yeah.
You can have a look and see what's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/944-3
03:33:24.194 --> 03:33:24.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>happening. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/945-0
03:33:26.815 --> 03:33:30.669
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK, that's good.
Investment funds end to end process now.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/945-1
03:33:30.669 --> 03:33:36.117
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That could be a minefield, I don't know.
But again maybe we can get Chris's input</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/945-2
03:33:36.117 --> 03:33:39.106
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>on that on that end to end process.
I don't,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/945-3
03:33:39.106 --> 03:33:42.827
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean maybe could you briefly describe
what that yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/945-4
03:33:42.827 --> 03:33:46.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>let me just queries that come off the
back end.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/946-0
03:33:46.975 --> 03:33:51.740
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>As the billing requests and you know
everything just goes all that particular</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/946-1
03:33:51.740 --> 03:33:54.611
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>type,
so they're always relating funds because</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/946-2
03:33:54.611 --> 03:33:58.093
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>under that, OK,
in the general in quit query form we can</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/946-3
03:33:58.093 --> 03:34:03.041
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>lead that they're invested fund query if
it was a write off request and it'll be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/946-4
03:34:03.041 --> 03:34:06.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>in their invoice request.
So it's it's sort of a.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/947-0
03:34:06.375 --> 03:34:09.307
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's right.
So we've got a keyword in there that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/947-1
03:34:09.307 --> 03:34:13.102
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>which is investment fund,
too much different in the other half of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/947-2
03:34:13.102 --> 03:34:17.126
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>general billing, it's just OK.
So we could capture that as one of the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/947-3
03:34:17.126 --> 03:34:19.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>categories within the general. OK,
perfect.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/948-0
03:34:21.895 --> 03:34:25.882
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That was very helpful.
I just pulled them out because they just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/948-1
03:34:25.882 --> 03:34:29.121
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>seemed yeah,
to not naturally fall into the service</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/948-2
03:34:29.121 --> 03:34:33.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that we're trying to end,
that I'm going to go to complex billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/948-3
03:34:33.295 --> 03:34:38.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I did actually notice that some of the
other manage invoice had complex in it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/949-0
03:34:39.535 --> 03:34:41.719
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>David,
can I just take a visiting to check?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/949-1
03:34:41.719 --> 03:34:44.002
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Do you think we will get through what's
left?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/949-2
03:34:44.002 --> 03:34:46.931
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm just not sure what's going to pull up
complex billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/949-3
03:34:46.931 --> 03:34:50.852
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>When I pulled it up just a minute ago,
I thought I just wanted to ask the room</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/949-4
03:34:50.852 --> 03:34:53.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>if it.
If we think we're going to finish with</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/949-5
03:34:53.135 --> 03:34:56.808
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>one, are we happy to just keep?
I think if I pull up complex billing now,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/949-6
03:34:56.808 --> 03:34:58.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you might be pleasantly surprised.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/950-0
03:34:58.615 --> 03:35:04.561
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think there's two OK in there and then
we reporting and we've done whip, OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/950-1
03:35:04.561 --> 03:35:10.357
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>not that I want to whisk through it. Look,
we, we're here to get through it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/950-2
03:35:10.357 --> 03:35:15.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but maybe just pull up query and report.
So I just know that the count.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/951-0
03:35:16.255 --> 03:35:18.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Look, I'm reports.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/952-0
03:35:23.255 --> 03:35:26.404
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.
And I think there was a query one as well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/952-1
03:35:26.404 --> 03:35:29.102
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>yes,
a billing support and that's billing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/952-2
03:35:29.102 --> 03:35:32.443
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>support query.
You know that can come under general</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/952-3
03:35:32.443 --> 03:35:35.591
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>inquiry,
but why don't we do the complex billing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/952-4
03:35:35.591 --> 03:35:37.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and I'm not sure I mean it says 2.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/953-0
03:35:38.255 --> 03:35:42.038
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But that could be yes, you know?
And so this is going to be complex,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/953-1
03:35:42.038 --> 03:35:45.053
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I guess. Well,
some of the other actually I found that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/953-2
03:35:45.053 --> 03:35:49.273
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>if we look through manage invoice,
there was some complexities that actually</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/953-3
03:35:49.273 --> 03:35:53.001
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>fell under complex as well.
So we started with simple billing which</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/953-4
03:35:53.001 --> 03:35:56.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>sounded actually there was lots of
scenarios in there.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/954-0
03:35:56.615 --> 03:36:01.298
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We had the new work in progress closed
with maybe some actions.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/954-1
03:36:01.298 --> 03:36:05.835
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The fact that it is,
you know assigned to whip or reversed or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/954-2
03:36:05.835 --> 03:36:09.347
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>etcetera.
So tell me what or maybe what defines</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/954-3
03:36:09.347 --> 03:36:11.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>complex billing in addition to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/955-0
03:36:12.135 --> 03:36:16.585
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Billing of the scenarios that we
discussed today and you'll probably say</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/955-1
03:36:16.585 --> 03:36:21.339
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>where do I, where do I start on that?
But you know maybe the the scenarios or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/955-2
03:36:21.339 --> 03:36:26.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>why why they deem the separation or do
you have a separation you just know that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/955-3
03:36:26.215 --> 03:36:30.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>these are going to be complex.
I mean there are other complex.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/956-0
03:36:30.455 --> 03:36:37.674
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Requests that commend these as a monthly
you know how every single month these are</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/956-1
03:36:37.674 --> 03:36:43.848
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>dealt with, and they're the most complex.
That is very time consuming.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/956-2
03:36:43.848 --> 03:36:47.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Louise is the expert in terms of the the
time.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/957-0
03:36:48.615 --> 03:36:54.676
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And the amount of scenarios within them
and the back and forth also the client,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/957-1
03:36:54.676 --> 03:36:58.843
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>yeah. And the client, oh,
you have particular clients,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/957-2
03:36:58.843 --> 03:37:03.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but for this well for this these
categories specifically this.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/958-0
03:37:03.935 --> 03:37:07.342
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Only covers Goldman Sachs.
That's just one time.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/958-1
03:37:07.342 --> 03:37:11.791
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So basically complex billing equals
Goldman Sachs. Yes, I mean,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/958-2
03:37:11.791 --> 03:37:15.962
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there are other things that are classed
as complex billing,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/958-3
03:37:15.962 --> 03:37:21.733
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we would probably categorise them as
part of the scenario voice or reversal or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/958-4
03:37:21.733 --> 03:37:22.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>whatever it is.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/959-0
03:37:23.495 --> 03:37:26.605
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean split invoice,
I've noticed as we were going through.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/959-1
03:37:26.605 --> 03:37:29.000
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Actually I should have put that under
complex,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/959-2
03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:32.874
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we covered so this categories you
have everything whereas some of these</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/959-3
03:37:32.874 --> 03:37:35.626
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>components could be across other other
clients. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/959-4
03:37:35.626 --> 03:37:38.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So you have all those scenarios that we
discussed today and.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/960-0
03:37:39.015 --> 03:37:43.755
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's and some more. Yeah, I mean, again,
this is just in terms of these actual</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/960-1
03:37:43.755 --> 03:37:48.435
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>categories are probably things that
actually could be maybe renamed or reject</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/960-2
03:37:48.435 --> 03:37:51.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>about.
I was just going to say like thinking</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/960-3
03:37:51.135 --> 03:37:55.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>about how the actual request comes in.
I'm assuming somebody wouldn't come up</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/960-4
03:37:55.815 --> 03:37:56.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and say.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/962-0
03:37:56.655 --> 03:38:01.515
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I want to raise a complex invoice.
Would they say I want to raise a some an</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/962-1
03:38:01.515 --> 03:38:06.567
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>invoice or a bill for Goldman Sachs? Well,
and the instance of these ones? No,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/962-2
03:38:06.567 --> 03:38:09.381
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because we don't actually receive
requests.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/962-3
03:38:09.381 --> 03:38:14.689
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>These are ones that are a bit kind of out
niche out of the norm and you're handing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/962-4
03:38:14.689 --> 03:38:16.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>them you've separated.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/963-0
03:38:16.135 --> 03:38:20.832
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Good to them out. Yes.
So basically how how these kind of start</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/963-1
03:38:20.832 --> 03:38:26.190
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>life is by us running a report.
So it's kind of generated by the billing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/963-2
03:38:26.190 --> 03:38:31.988
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>team and and the first instance yes.
So rather than the request coming in from</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/963-3
03:38:31.988 --> 03:38:33.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>APE or whoever it's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/964-0
03:38:34.295 --> 03:38:39.465
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sort of triggered by usually myself or
someone else. A monthly report? Yes.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/964-1
03:38:39.465 --> 03:38:44.906
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we do have other activity that we do
around that like that is weekly reports</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/964-2
03:38:44.906 --> 03:38:50.347
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that we run and everything basically to
do with that is categorised under these</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/964-3
03:38:50.347 --> 03:38:51.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>categories.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/965-0
03:38:51.575 --> 03:38:54.850
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And share bill.
So even if it was something like a write</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/965-1
03:38:54.850 --> 03:38:59.674
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>off or an invoice rejection or something,
we put everything to do with this process</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/965-2
03:38:59.674 --> 03:39:04.097
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>into these categories really just so that
it's kind of all in the one place.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/965-3
03:39:04.097 --> 03:39:08.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But in terms of the actual kind of
billing process for them basically.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/966-0
03:39:10.255 --> 03:39:13.381
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There's swallows,
so it's like where to begin?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/966-1
03:39:13.381 --> 03:39:17.571
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And there's two different clients.
They're both Goldman Sachs,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/966-2
03:39:17.571 --> 03:39:21.428
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but they're separated on two different
clients by region.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/966-3
03:39:21.428 --> 03:39:25.883
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's how they're separated.
So the the most straightforward 1 to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/966-4
03:39:25.883 --> 03:39:26.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>explain.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/967-0
03:39:26.815 --> 03:39:31.186
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The we already essentially know when
they're ready to Bill,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/967-1
03:39:31.186 --> 03:39:34.609
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and we already have their billing
information,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/967-2
03:39:34.609 --> 03:39:39.999
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so I can just go on and run the report
and essentially set up the groups.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/967-3
03:39:39.999 --> 03:39:44.296
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And so I mean that in itself and you do
that all in three.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/967-4
03:39:44.296 --> 03:39:46.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So that's yeah and what you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/968-0
03:39:46.535 --> 03:39:50.126
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Running on the report,
what sort of information are you trying</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/968-1
03:39:50.126 --> 03:39:54.172
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to find the report around? Flight.
It's just called the ready to build</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/968-2
03:39:54.172 --> 03:39:58.504
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>report and you kind of run that on any
Goldman Sachs matters that have been</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/968-3
03:39:58.504 --> 03:40:01.695
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>marked as ready to build.
That happens prior to patent.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/969-0
03:40:02.175 --> 03:40:05.355
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The billing team and also that's by date
as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/969-1
03:40:05.355 --> 03:40:10.251
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it will be to just the current date
theoretically anything that's on that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/969-2
03:40:10.251 --> 03:40:14.384
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>report is ready to Bill. So it doesn't,
we don't need approvals,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/969-3
03:40:14.384 --> 03:40:18.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it doesn't need to go to be ease.
It's all fixed fee work.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/970-0
03:40:18.695 --> 03:40:23.955
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So the WEP doesn't, you know,
really come into or anything like that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/970-1
03:40:23.955 --> 03:40:27.637
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>In theory,
we can just set up the groups and and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/970-2
03:40:27.637 --> 03:40:31.468
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>practise.
This will be more complicated than that,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/970-3
03:40:31.468 --> 03:40:35.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but that is the kind of basics of the
process, the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/971-0
03:40:36.095 --> 03:40:41.889
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Other side of this is a little bit more
complicated because we issue bills for</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/971-1
03:40:41.889 --> 03:40:46.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the month end figures,
but we don't actually have the breakdowns</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/971-2
03:40:46.655 --> 03:40:50.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>at that point.
So we then have to wait for the client</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/971-3
03:40:50.615 --> 03:40:54.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>allocations and they are then reversed
and reassured.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/972-0
03:40:55.975 --> 03:41:02.126
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But all of these processes are happening
just in three E it's not been triggered</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/972-1
03:41:02.126 --> 03:41:06.986
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>by anything and share will or OK service
now. So I'm wondering,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/972-2
03:41:06.986 --> 03:41:12.681
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean so everything for your complex
internal happens in 3E today and the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/972-3
03:41:12.681 --> 03:41:14.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>notifications and all the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/973-0
03:41:15.815 --> 03:41:19.779
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Actions that you need to do happen in
there so well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/973-1
03:41:19.779 --> 03:41:25.686
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm saying the IT lives its life in 3E
for this particular in terms of getting</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/973-2
03:41:25.686 --> 03:41:29.948
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>up to the point of billing,
so running off to the ports,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/973-3
03:41:29.948 --> 03:41:34.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>all that stuff. Yes,
once it's billed as sent out just.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/974-0
03:41:34.415 --> 03:41:38.635
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Via e-mail at the moment I'll go to the
client or E billing or whatever,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/974-1
03:41:38.635 --> 03:41:43.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and at that point that's when I'll copy
and billing and that's when it'll come in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/974-2
03:41:43.375 --> 03:41:46.959
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>through share well.
But it's only really so that as a kind of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/974-3
03:41:46.959 --> 03:41:50.081
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>audit trail and share well of this has
happened. Yep.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/974-4
03:41:50.081 --> 03:41:52.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So just to give you a little bit of
background.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/975-0
03:41:53.135 --> 03:41:57.913
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There are four clients,
what we call like G20. Like, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/975-1
03:41:57.913 --> 03:42:02.464
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the big twenty clients,
but out of those 24 big and complex</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/975-2
03:42:02.464 --> 03:42:08.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>clients we we work in a very different
way from a working capital perspective.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/977-0
03:42:09.015 --> 03:42:12.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And we won't have any issues with PS as
well on those,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/977-1
03:42:12.255 --> 03:42:16.613
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because we work in a collaborative way.
So all these things, for example,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/977-2
03:42:16.613 --> 03:42:19.794
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>trigger by the whip,
the whip goes to credit control,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/977-3
03:42:19.794 --> 03:42:23.092
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they both verify and then it comes from a
billing site.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/977-4
03:42:23.092 --> 03:42:26.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we all chip in our responsibilities
over there.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/978-0
03:42:26.575 --> 03:42:32.082
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And we monitor the steps of those as well.
We have a specific person called</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/978-1
03:42:32.082 --> 03:42:36.865
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>strategic account manager Sam assigned
for these clients as well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/978-2
03:42:36.865 --> 03:42:41.285
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>who drives centralised in a centralised
way with the client.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/978-3
03:42:41.285 --> 03:42:44.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's a very tight water tight process.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/979-0
03:42:44.855 --> 03:42:45.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But it's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/980-0
03:42:47.295 --> 03:42:50.189
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yes, everything should be in three. Yeah,
nothing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/980-1
03:42:50.189 --> 03:42:54.786
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Nothing goes out because the reportings
are slightly different from your rest of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/980-2
03:42:54.786 --> 03:42:57.339
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>your billing.
Your E billing people as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/980-3
03:42:57.339 --> 03:43:01.822
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And I think from enabling perspective the
the client portals would be same but</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/980-4
03:43:01.822 --> 03:43:04.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>still the process managed is very
different.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/981-0
03:43:11.575 --> 03:43:17.253
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. Actually in terms of all we say,
it's complex billing in terms of what</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/981-1
03:43:17.253 --> 03:43:23.077
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>will actually go through service now, yes,
it's zero. Pretty much, yeah. Well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/981-2
03:43:23.077 --> 03:43:28.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean that's so it's not anything that's
really being managed and shared with.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/982-0
03:43:29.095 --> 03:43:33.864
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm wondering if you're communicating
because you've got a query or whatever,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/982-1
03:43:33.864 --> 03:43:38.938
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you can't communicate through 3 E so you
would communicate or when you communicate</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/982-2
03:43:38.938 --> 03:43:41.628
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>through service now.
Or do you communicate?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/982-3
03:43:41.628 --> 03:43:46.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is there notifications in three-way?
You say it's a very structured process.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/983-0
03:43:46.695 --> 03:43:50.995
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So how are you communicating between
workflow states at the moment in that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/983-1
03:43:50.995 --> 03:43:55.753
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's all manual outlook, you know? Yeah,
as you do that through your personal mail</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/983-2
03:43:55.753 --> 03:43:59.078
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>book mail. Yes. Although as again,
it depends what it is.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/983-3
03:43:59.078 --> 03:44:02.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If it was just something that was a query
or sometimes like.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/984-0
03:44:03.455 --> 03:44:07.602
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Unless like if I need to e-mail the fee
and or say because there's missing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/984-1
03:44:07.602 --> 03:44:11.527
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>information or something like that,
that just goes through my outlook.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/984-2
03:44:11.527 --> 03:44:14.346
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's not.
I'm not copying billing and capture that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/984-3
03:44:14.346 --> 03:44:18.880
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>though and and one thing is that a lot of
a lot of scenarios and these clients we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/984-4
03:44:18.880 --> 03:44:21.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>are also speaking directly to the client
as well, yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/985-0
03:44:22.735 --> 03:44:25.795
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So agree.
But I think client will be contacting day</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/985-1
03:44:25.795 --> 03:44:30.679
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>in day out with us on on such scenarios.
So I'm talking about Goldman Sachs at NOC</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/985-2
03:44:30.679 --> 03:44:34.268
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>etcetera, etcetera.
So agree that it should follow some side</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/985-3
03:44:34.268 --> 03:44:39.092
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of channel because we don't have a we do
have oversight of the different statuses</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/985-4
03:44:39.092 --> 03:44:41.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as well.
Don't get me wrong and it's more water.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/986-0
03:44:42.055 --> 03:44:45.921
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Right than others. But yes,
why not put somewhere in the service now</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/986-1
03:44:45.921 --> 03:44:48.666
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to do? Well,
I'm just thinking if Louise is off,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/986-2
03:44:48.666 --> 03:44:51.411
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>for example,
it's all going through her personal</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/986-3
03:44:51.411 --> 03:44:54.156
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>mailbox.
She won't have any anything that's sent</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/986-4
03:44:54.156 --> 03:44:58.022
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's actually sent out.
Like to the client. Or when we have, like,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/986-5
03:44:58.022 --> 03:45:01.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>say, the final invoices.
I'll always copy billing in. So there is.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/987-0
03:45:01.935 --> 03:45:02.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/988-0
03:45:04.375 --> 03:45:07.593
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. Yeah. So we won't.
So we won't be using e-mail if we imagine</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/988-1
03:45:07.593 --> 03:45:11.243
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>a world where we're not using e-mail.
So you can't copy yourself and see in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/988-2
03:45:11.243 --> 03:45:14.268
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that instance though,
like if we're emailing out directly to a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/988-3
03:45:14.268 --> 03:45:16.525
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>client,
are we going to be sending emails from</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/988-4
03:45:16.525 --> 03:45:20.127
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ServiceNow, you can't do that. Yeah,
that's that's what I was about to say</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/988-5
03:45:20.127 --> 03:45:22.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because you may want to trigger the case.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/989-0
03:45:22.695 --> 03:45:26.641
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then direct all the e-mail
communication through that case for these</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/989-1
03:45:26.641 --> 03:45:30.640
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>complex matters. If we had that workflow,
for example, within ServiceNow,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/989-2
03:45:30.640 --> 03:45:34.693
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you could officiate those communications
that you're doing. That might be,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/989-3
03:45:34.693 --> 03:45:38.206
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you would start them rather than waiting
for someone to commend,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/989-4
03:45:38.206 --> 03:45:41.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you would just create it under whatever
we agree the category to be.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/991-0
03:45:42.695 --> 03:45:46.303
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then any correspondence client would
go e-mail.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/991-1
03:45:46.303 --> 03:45:50.050
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If there's other teams and ask for
example, involved,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/991-2
03:45:50.050 --> 03:45:54.421
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and they're on service now,
it can go through the notification</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/990-0
03:45:53.055 --> 03:45:53.335
<v Mark Sedge>Yep.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/991-3
03:45:54.421 --> 03:45:58.931
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>process and an e-mail.
One thing for us is Steven triggers a lot</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/991-4
03:45:58.931 --> 03:46:01.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of these discussions and reports as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/993-0
03:46:02.015 --> 03:46:05.054
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>From credit control and they're not
unsure about right now.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/993-1
03:46:05.054 --> 03:46:08.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That might be one of the reason that we
are not following that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/993-2
03:46:08.295 --> 03:46:11.941
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But then with the one with service now
they will be, yeah they will be,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/993-3
03:46:11.941 --> 03:46:15.941
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>yeah they will be. So it makes sense.
So we could have that official workflow,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/992-0
03:46:15.575 --> 03:46:15.735
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/993-4
03:46:15.941 --> 03:46:19.537
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean officiate that we could have a
look at the touch points and the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/993-5
03:46:19.537 --> 03:46:21.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>assignment groups and then the
notification.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/995-0
03:46:22.095 --> 03:46:25.133
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That get and it's monitoring your tasks
because again,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/995-1
03:46:25.133 --> 03:46:28.116
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know you say that it's zero impact on
ServiceNow,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/995-2
03:46:28.116 --> 03:46:32.313
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but actually you want ServiceNow to
reflect your capacity and your efforts.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/995-3
03:46:32.313 --> 03:46:35.572
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It will be that right?
Because if it doesn't happen at the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/994-0
03:46:34.575 --> 03:46:34.695
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/995-4
03:46:35.572 --> 03:46:37.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>moment, but you know if you remember.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/996-0
03:46:37.735 --> 03:46:41.423
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And it it it is,
it is that on during our AP discussion,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/996-1
03:46:41.423 --> 03:46:46.534
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I was talking about manual payments,
individual payments and then a bulk file.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/996-2
03:46:46.534 --> 03:46:51.515
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So this is a more of a bulk file logic
because we are not sending individual</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/996-3
03:46:51.515 --> 03:46:53.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>emails, it's a file, isn't it?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/997-0
03:46:53.975 --> 03:46:58.131
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>With the listings of the Bills,
which needs to be going out so it would</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/997-1
03:46:58.131 --> 03:47:02.517
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>be interesting to know how does the MI
stats etcetera get captured as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/997-2
03:47:02.517 --> 03:47:06.960
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think we were talking like total value,
total count kind of thing as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/997-3
03:47:06.960 --> 03:47:09.788
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah the guys will discuss it on Monday
as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/997-4
03:47:09.788 --> 03:47:13.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What happens to the billing status in
terms of some gets?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/998-0
03:47:13.655 --> 03:47:17.195
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Rejected as well some line items,
some line items will be rejected,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/998-1
03:47:17.195 --> 03:47:20.422
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>some will be. Yeah.
Proves that I think maybe something for a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/998-2
03:47:20.422 --> 03:47:24.378
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>parking lot for Monday to remind those
guys and say how to? How will? Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/998-3
03:47:24.378 --> 03:47:26.669
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Baldwin's on the call. So we capture.
Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/998-4
03:47:26.669 --> 03:47:30.156
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think the I think the first focus is
that workflow to manage the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/998-5
03:47:30.156 --> 03:47:33.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>communications that kind of stuff.
So obviously the next.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/999-0
03:47:33.575 --> 03:47:37.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What we also need to remember,
as well as the reporting, will be on it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/999-1
03:47:37.135 --> 03:47:40.744
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so you wouldn't need to wait for,
I don't know how they send them to you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/999-2
03:47:40.744 --> 03:47:44.700
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>just now if they emailed the reports over.
No, I never run them off myself. OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/999-3
03:47:44.700 --> 03:47:47.518
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But another thing as well.
And that's my with E billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/999-4
03:47:47.518 --> 03:47:49.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But we do get quite a bit of rejections.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1000-0
03:47:49.535 --> 03:47:53.258
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, on these as well. And again,
just now and when they come through share,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1000-1
03:47:53.258 --> 03:47:56.838
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>well, they're stuck in these categories.
It tends to be if myself depicts.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1000-2
03:47:56.838 --> 03:47:59.081
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But again,
now you get a rejection and that is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1000-3
03:47:59.081 --> 03:48:02.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>recorded in shareville, yes,
because you well if it's something that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1000-4
03:48:02.375 --> 03:48:05.000
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Ebel and I've just can pick up and
resolve themselves,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1000-5
03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:08.245
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it doesn't need to come back to us.
We don't need to know about it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1000-6
03:48:08.245 --> 03:48:09.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but quite often worth.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1002-0
03:48:09.535 --> 03:48:11.787
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The Goldman Sachs one is JP Morgan's as
well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1002-1
03:48:11.787 --> 03:48:15.949
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There's quite a lot of rejections on them,
so it'll be billing that start that then,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1002-2
03:48:15.949 --> 03:48:19.424
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so they'll OE upload the bill because
it's an E bill and get rejected,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1002-3
03:48:19.424 --> 03:48:22.068
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then they'll pass it to you and see it's
a rejection.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1002-4
03:48:22.068 --> 03:48:25.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You manage it I think because credit
control was not unsure and I think that's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1002-5
03:48:25.935 --> 03:48:29.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the missing link. That's yeah,
that should have a better workflow.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1003-0
03:48:30.015 --> 03:48:34.107
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, yeah. And you can pick up, you know,
all those processes that we talked about</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1003-1
03:48:34.107 --> 03:48:36.883
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>this morning as part of your workflow.
When it hits you,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1003-2
03:48:36.883 --> 03:48:40.000
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>when we we get that access to that
workflow, you can, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1003-3
03:48:40.000 --> 03:48:43.653
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>access reversals and split bill,
you know that you've got all those things</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1003-4
03:48:43.653 --> 03:48:47.208
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that we discussed as part of that
workflow that can be built in as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1003-5
03:48:47.208 --> 03:48:48.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>When it hits yourself at billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1004-0
03:48:50.095 --> 03:48:53.606
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That'd be good, but if we get that,
we can do that as a a separate workshop</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1004-1
03:48:53.606 --> 03:48:56.654
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>or it's one of the ones where it's kind
of an end to end service,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1004-2
03:48:56.654 --> 03:48:58.825
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>which we need to connect together. Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1004-3
03:48:58.825 --> 03:49:01.550
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So can I just ask a general question as
well? So then see,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1004-4
03:49:01.550 --> 03:49:05.199
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>like on those ones when we're talking
about sending out to the client directly</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1004-5
03:49:05.199 --> 03:49:06.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>when they e-mail back.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1005-0
03:49:07.015 --> 03:49:10.529
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Does that just comment to service? No.
Yeah, we'll come into that case.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1005-1
03:49:10.529 --> 03:49:13.701
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You'll get those updates as well.
So everybody's got well again.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1005-2
03:49:13.701 --> 03:49:17.799
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It could be. And again with the workflow,
it could be you don't want this person to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1005-3
03:49:17.799 --> 03:49:20.483
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>have transfer.
You know you can hide and show what you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1005-4
03:49:20.483 --> 03:49:23.460
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>want or your own notes or you know,
because it isn't really.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1005-5
03:49:23.460 --> 03:49:25.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The thing is we're not sending out a lot
of.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1006-0
03:49:27.015 --> 03:49:30.062
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Maybe a silly question because on APPS I
I don't think so.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1006-1
03:49:30.062 --> 03:49:34.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We we had that kind of a scenario where
you're sending the bulk file and there is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1006-2
03:49:34.295 --> 03:49:36.722
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>a rejection,
but there will be only one or two</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1006-3
03:49:36.722 --> 03:49:40.284
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>rejections which is easy to manage that
response back from the bank.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1006-4
03:49:40.284 --> 03:49:44.157
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But in this case there might be multiple
reject not might be there will be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1006-5
03:49:44.157 --> 03:49:46.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>multiple rejections on the invoices.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1007-0
03:49:46.095 --> 03:49:49.659
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So if I am triggering if I'm sending out
that report out.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1007-1
03:49:49.659 --> 03:49:54.390
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So basically it's just one report report
and I can't go on and create 100 of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1007-2
03:49:54.390 --> 03:49:58.076
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>categories for. Yeah,
we need to have a look at that. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1007-3
03:49:58.076 --> 03:50:01.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Out of those hundred bills at 10
rejections are there.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1008-0
03:50:01.895 --> 03:50:04.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>How will it work?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1009-0
03:50:05.535 --> 03:50:08.593
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Can we not solution?
But I mean it's possible. I mean look,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1009-1
03:50:08.593 --> 03:50:12.008
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you could have it all listed and they
they they're rejecting them,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1009-2
03:50:12.008 --> 03:50:14.862
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is that right?
Is that the client side that's rejecting</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1009-3
03:50:14.862 --> 03:50:17.105
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it?
I mean it could be I mean again I don't</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1009-4
03:50:17.105 --> 03:50:20.774
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>want to solutionize but you know
sometimes in the past they got a whole</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1009-5
03:50:20.774 --> 03:50:24.648
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>checklist which they can you know
officially gives you a line item for each</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1009-6
03:50:24.648 --> 03:50:25.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1010-0
03:50:25.455 --> 03:50:28.465
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You don't want to do and.
Look I went solution but there is the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1010-1
03:50:28.465 --> 03:50:31.898
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>possibility again that we'll make that
journey easy for, but is that is,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1010-2
03:50:31.898 --> 03:50:35.801
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ServiceNow has functionality to is that
from the client or making it down? No, no,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1010-3
03:50:35.801 --> 03:50:37.729
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>no.
We could give that access to them to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1010-4
03:50:37.729 --> 03:50:40.080
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>break it down.
I mean they don't have to do that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1010-5
03:50:40.080 --> 03:50:43.137
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What essentially what you want them to do,
what do you do today?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1010-6
03:50:43.137 --> 03:50:44.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What do they do today do they say?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1012-0
03:50:46.095 --> 03:50:48.648
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Say reject line item 123 reject line item
456.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1012-1
03:50:48.648 --> 03:50:52.829
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think they will refer at the back of
the invoice number and say yes. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1012-2
03:50:52.829 --> 03:50:57.337
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Well from what gets sent back to Bell and
anyway it tends to be just so they could</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1012-3
03:50:57.337 --> 03:51:01.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean and reason for maybe I'll do it as
a simple level it could be reject all.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1013-0
03:51:02.775 --> 03:51:07.736
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Reject none. Reject some. So if it's some,
you could get them leading.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1013-1
03:51:07.736 --> 03:51:11.369
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Which ones you know as a again,
not to solutionize,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1013-2
03:51:11.369 --> 03:51:17.098
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but would they be prepared to say before
you know and they enter those details of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1013-3
03:51:17.098 --> 03:51:18.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the reject some.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1014-0
03:51:18.655 --> 03:51:22.330
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean, if it's,
if it's and again the reverse of that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1014-1
03:51:22.330 --> 03:51:25.676
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If they're rejecting most of it apart
from not to,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1014-2
03:51:25.676 --> 03:51:30.270
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they could do that logic as well.
It depends what depends what we've.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1014-3
03:51:30.270 --> 03:51:34.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm just conscious because they are first
of all client portals.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1014-4
03:51:34.535 --> 03:51:37.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's like a client's third party
portal, yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1015-0
03:51:38.135 --> 03:51:42.447
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So convincing them to use a service,
what we want them to use a different ball</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1015-1
03:51:42.447 --> 03:51:45.940
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>game. That's what I was just thinking.
Yeah, it was just crazy.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1015-2
03:51:45.940 --> 03:51:49.761
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's maybe not the step that we go to.
It's maybe just if they sit,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1015-3
03:51:49.761 --> 03:51:52.271
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so they send it back in the same form,
right?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1015-4
03:51:52.271 --> 03:51:56.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We're basically emailing out to them.
It'll go out as an e-mail to them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1016-0
03:51:56.615 --> 03:51:59.200
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>However,
they would reject that at the moment I'm</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1016-1
03:51:59.200 --> 03:52:03.283
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>assuming they'd reply to that e-mail and
they tell you what it is that they're</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1016-2
03:52:03.283 --> 03:52:06.643
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>rejecting in some shape or form.
How do they send the rejection?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1016-3
03:52:06.643 --> 03:52:09.796
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Do they send it back?
It's like emailing back with a list of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1016-4
03:52:09.796 --> 03:52:12.794
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>invoices I assume,
or highlighting them on the track that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1016-5
03:52:12.794 --> 03:52:15.895
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>might be in terms of what?
What I mean more an e-mail info.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1017-0
03:52:16.695 --> 03:52:20.963
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm in terms of as far as I'm aware,
they'll reject it on their portal and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1017-1
03:52:20.963 --> 03:52:25.344
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then that triggers a notification to E
billing to E billing and it will tell</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1017-2
03:52:25.344 --> 03:52:28.246
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>them what it is will be and send it to
you, right?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1017-3
03:52:28.246 --> 03:52:30.920
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That might be useful for certainly the
myself,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1017-4
03:52:30.920 --> 03:52:33.935
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and probably for some like Mark and
whatever else's.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1018-0
03:52:34.415 --> 03:52:38.209
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We obviously this obviously came up early
in the week where you get like 600 emails</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1018-1
03:52:38.209 --> 03:52:41.732
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>into the box for rejections etcetera.
It would be useful to get an example of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1018-2
03:52:41.732 --> 03:52:45.254
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>each of the type of rejections that the
client portals are sending in because</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1018-3
03:52:45.254 --> 03:52:48.777
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then we should be able to see look for
things like consistencies and whatever</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1018-4
03:52:48.777 --> 03:52:50.899
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>else.
And also I think you said there's a demo</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1018-5
03:52:50.899 --> 03:52:51.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of our.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1019-0
03:52:51.935 --> 03:52:55.683
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>A platform in a few weeks that we're
moving to from from an E billing point of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1019-1
03:52:55.683 --> 03:52:59.193
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>view because I know that Eddie Com you're
talking about. Yeah, Eddie com.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1019-2
03:52:59.193 --> 03:53:02.940
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I know in the past you can sort of set
rules up there to test it to see before</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1019-3
03:53:02.940 --> 03:53:06.734
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it gets to the client rather than client
rejecting it because they don't reject</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1019-4
03:53:06.734 --> 03:53:09.343
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>based on. Yeah,
I mean that's kind of like a different</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1019-5
03:53:09.343 --> 03:53:11.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>functionality. Eddie. Com is not going to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1020-0
03:53:11.415 --> 03:53:14.218
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Be able to say reject or not reject.
To be honest,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1020-1
03:53:14.218 --> 03:53:18.173
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's edicom is just going to be the
centre point where we are resource.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1020-2
03:53:18.173 --> 03:53:21.195
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We are we're channelling those invoices.
Yeah, I know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1020-3
03:53:21.195 --> 03:53:23.723
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I know it's the middleware and whatever
else.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1020-4
03:53:23.723 --> 03:53:28.008
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But in in previous businesses it was
possible to set rules up and to say if I</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1020-5
03:53:28.008 --> 03:53:30.535
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>send you an invoice and it's for that
target.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1021-0
03:53:31.135 --> 03:53:35.036
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And it's got this in it. Send me it back.
Don't send it over there. So it just goes,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1021-1
03:53:35.036 --> 03:53:38.661
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it bounces off your own platform rather
than going out and then bouncing back.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1021-2
03:53:38.661 --> 03:53:42.469
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I was saying that at least in the first
instance, not every solution, as you said,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1021-3
03:53:42.469 --> 03:53:45.727
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>everybody that's involved in that
workflow will now be on service now.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1021-4
03:53:45.727 --> 03:53:46.415
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we've got a.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1022-0
03:53:46.775 --> 03:53:50.697
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Advantage that we can start to use of
assignments and monitoring that workflow.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1022-1
03:53:50.697 --> 03:53:53.000
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah,
I I I I think now I'm comfortable in the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1022-2
03:53:53.000 --> 03:53:56.872
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>sense when you said it goes to E billing.
So that's OK because they will get a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1022-3
03:53:56.872 --> 03:53:59.176
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>normal. Yeah,
they'll do what they need to do.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1022-4
03:53:59.176 --> 03:54:03.097
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They'll receive their action later and
they'll give you the instructions. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1022-5
03:54:03.097 --> 03:54:04.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I I think I'm. I'm.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1023-0
03:54:04.495 --> 03:54:07.572
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Fine. Yeah. Yes.
So because if we create multiple line</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1023-1
03:54:07.572 --> 03:54:10.480
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>items on the request,
it's really a lot more, yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1023-2
03:54:10.480 --> 03:54:14.115
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And I think when we're talking about
communicating with clients,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1023-3
03:54:14.115 --> 03:54:17.975
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it needs to be really simple.
We should just be asking them to reply</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1023-4
03:54:17.975 --> 03:54:20.715
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>back to us and we do the work on the
other side,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1023-5
03:54:20.715 --> 03:54:23.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you do the heavy lifting rather than
getting them to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1024-0
03:54:24.095 --> 03:54:24.775
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1025-0
03:54:27.935 --> 03:54:31.590
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Was that complex billing?
I think it's slightly complex and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1025-1
03:54:31.590 --> 03:54:34.271
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>necessary. Sure,
I think that was actually,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1025-2
03:54:34.271 --> 03:54:38.596
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think that was a great win to have that
workflow to at least assist,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1025-3
03:54:38.596 --> 03:54:42.494
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know yourself and to officiate it
through ServiceNow. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1025-4
03:54:42.494 --> 03:54:46.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and with the kind of other ones that for
other clients come under.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1026-0
03:54:47.135 --> 03:54:52.175
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They're still under the PFA category,
although they're not done by APFA,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1026-1
03:54:52.175 --> 03:54:57.354
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but the other clients that have these
kind of different processes that are</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1026-2
03:54:57.354 --> 03:55:01.358
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>filed under PFA.
So I don't really want to have a look at</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1026-3
03:55:01.358 --> 03:55:02.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>them as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1027-0
03:55:03.135 --> 03:55:06.472
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yes, yes. Yeah. Which ones are they? So,
yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1027-1
03:55:06.472 --> 03:55:12.010
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>basically any of the ones that are GM, OK,
they still belong to billing. Yes.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1027-2
03:55:12.010 --> 03:55:15.844
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it was pre.
It's just really kind of changing role</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1027-3
03:55:15.844 --> 03:55:19.465
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>really.
It was APFA role that did this previously.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1027-4
03:55:19.465 --> 03:55:22.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So the actual tasks are still being done.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1028-0
03:55:22.455 --> 03:55:26.093
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But so if we're talking about
categorising those global markets ones,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1028-1
03:55:26.093 --> 03:55:29.783
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then we should categorise them as complex
the same as the other. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1028-2
03:55:29.783 --> 03:55:32.641
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Goldman Sachs,
so that we can categorise them probably</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1028-3
03:55:32.641 --> 03:55:35.032
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>yes because they I think they probably
would,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1028-4
03:55:35.032 --> 03:55:38.825
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>would you agree with that that global
market stuff would all come in the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1028-5
03:55:38.825 --> 03:55:41.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>complex only really because it has a
different process.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1029-0
03:55:42.335 --> 03:55:45.838
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>To our standard invoice here that's
getting that makes sense.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1029-1
03:55:45.838 --> 03:55:49.736
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's just heavy lifting outside of the
process. It's a all internal,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1029-2
03:55:49.736 --> 03:55:54.312
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's a complex working capital billing
you know rather than just for the billing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1029-3
03:55:54.312 --> 03:55:57.249
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>actually because if you look at the, the,
the dots,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1029-4
03:55:57.249 --> 03:56:01.373
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what everybody's joining it's way,
way bigger than what normal Bill will</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1029-5
03:56:01.373 --> 03:56:01.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>come.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1030-0
03:56:02.055 --> 03:56:05.494
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Right. OK, Deborah. Sorry.
Just quickly that weekly invoice update</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1030-1
03:56:05.494 --> 03:56:09.754
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>call. So it's actually not on share will,
but Simon managed to find it on the MPL,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1030-2
03:56:09.754 --> 03:56:12.063
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's been archived,
it's no longer required.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1030-3
03:56:12.063 --> 03:56:15.655
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So that's probably to you can cross that
out in your your list scale.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1032-0
03:56:18.495 --> 03:56:21.737
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What's that? We're just going to.
We unmark it.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1032-1
03:56:21.737 --> 03:56:25.249
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's another one that is in task.
Question. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1032-2
03:56:25.249 --> 03:56:28.625
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't really know why it's under the
EFA. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1032-3
03:56:28.625 --> 03:56:33.758
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's not something I think we covered
that one. Didn't know whether it was.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1032-4
03:56:33.758 --> 03:56:34.095
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1033-0
03:56:34.615 --> 03:56:39.958
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think that's probably that's what one's
probably just more kind of general. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1033-1
03:56:39.958 --> 03:56:44.474
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>yeah. Yeah. It came under the,
I don't know why it was captured there,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1033-2
03:56:44.474 --> 03:56:49.498
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but that's a managing voice for the edit
pro forma ones and the next one down.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1033-3
03:56:49.498 --> 03:56:51.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So for these ones that are.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1034-0
03:56:53.375 --> 03:56:57.687
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They also come under complex billing.
I think that's and the one that's crossed</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1034-1
03:56:57.687 --> 03:57:00.112
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>out.
You also do that one for the investment</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1034-2
03:57:00.112 --> 03:57:03.184
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>funds. Oh, no,
that's been crossed out for the week. OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1034-3
03:57:03.184 --> 03:57:06.094
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so complex billing.
Do you do that again that we just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1034-4
03:57:06.094 --> 03:57:10.135
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>discussed? It doesn't hit you well,
you're doing them all outside into 3E.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1035-0
03:57:10.455 --> 03:57:14.467
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then is there a workflow similar to
what we just discussed that can be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1035-1
03:57:14.467 --> 03:57:15.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>officiated?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1036-0
03:57:18.015 --> 03:57:22.286
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Pretty much yes, because again,
it's they're kind of related to specific</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1036-1
03:57:22.286 --> 03:57:25.211
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>clients,
but it is kind of similar in that we are</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1036-2
03:57:25.211 --> 03:57:29.598
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>generating the report rather than
somebody's not coming to you and saying,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1036-3
03:57:29.598 --> 03:57:33.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>can you do this complex and it touches
client workflow that we can.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1037-0
03:57:35.095 --> 03:57:39.082
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. I mean, there are still,
it will still go through sharewell at the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1037-1
03:57:39.082 --> 03:57:41.704
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>moment,
kind of in a similar way to the Goldman</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1037-2
03:57:41.704 --> 03:57:44.926
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sachs like when I'm sending out to the
client or whatever,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1037-3
03:57:44.926 --> 03:57:48.421
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing is always in there.
So there is always a trail of it in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1037-4
03:57:48.421 --> 03:57:52.299
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>sharewell, but it's just as I say,
being triggered by us rather than a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1037-5
03:57:52.299 --> 03:57:52.735
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>request.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1038-0
03:57:52.855 --> 03:57:59.287
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And are the steps different for these non
Goldman Sachs clients like the tasks that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1038-1
03:57:59.287 --> 03:58:05.412
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you do? Yes. So there's 30, there's two.
The two kind of main clients that this</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1038-2
03:58:05.412 --> 03:58:08.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>covers as Citigroup and JP Morgan.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1040-0
03:58:08.415 --> 03:58:13.016
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So the second Group One has a kind of
similar process to Goldman Sachs and that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1040-1
03:58:13.016 --> 03:58:17.559
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we are going out to the client to get
their billing information at this stage,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1040-2
03:58:17.559 --> 03:58:22.045
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>which again is just kind of different to
what we do for other clients because</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1040-3
03:58:22.045 --> 03:58:25.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>usually we would already that or it would
come via the PES.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1041-0
03:58:25.655 --> 03:58:28.898
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Whatever. So again,
that's kind of similar really to them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1041-1
03:58:28.898 --> 03:58:32.856
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Once we've got their information,
we're running there as a good billing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1041-2
03:58:32.856 --> 03:58:33.295
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>process.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1042-0
03:58:37.775 --> 03:58:39.575
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yes. Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1043-0
03:58:42.895 --> 03:58:43.215
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1044-0
03:58:47.215 --> 03:58:52.335
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The JP Morgan ones are slightly different
because that actually may be changing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1044-1
03:58:52.335 --> 03:58:57.076
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So at the moment it's kind of similar
that we run a daily report for that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1044-2
03:58:57.076 --> 03:59:00.615
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think that was on there somewhere as I
scheduled and.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1045-0
03:59:01.735 --> 03:59:05.800
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And that's basically just a daily report
that we can run and then we can just go</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1045-1
03:59:05.800 --> 03:59:08.710
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ahead and build them because similar to
those other ones,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1045-2
03:59:08.710 --> 03:59:12.374
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they're fixed fees and they don't really
need any approvals or anything.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1045-3
03:59:12.374 --> 03:59:15.635
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But that is something a process that
might be actually changing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1045-4
03:59:15.635 --> 03:59:18.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But as it is right now,
that's sort of what happens. So.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1046-0
03:59:18.935 --> 03:59:19.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1047-0
03:59:20.295 --> 03:59:21.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>No.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1048-0
03:59:24.135 --> 03:59:27.808
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.
And just because the volumes of it and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1048-1
03:59:27.808 --> 03:59:34.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>really just because it has a separate
process to the, the kind of norm really.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1049-0
03:59:38.215 --> 03:59:38.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Mm-hmm.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1050-0
03:59:40.655 --> 03:59:41.855
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Hey, browse your mic on.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1051-0
03:59:43.735 --> 03:59:46.296
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Can't really use now is it?
Is that better?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1051-1
03:59:46.296 --> 03:59:49.148
