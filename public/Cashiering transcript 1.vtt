START OF Cashiering CONVERSATION PART 1:


717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/83-0
00:17:00.443 --> 00:17:05.320
<v Josh Sparkes>Please you mind with yourself for picking
up managed payments yesterday by</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/83-1
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:10.262
<v Josh Sparkes>Cashiering handle that signed a bit
differently from the UK. It's all that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/83-2
00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:13.123
<v Josh Sparkes>That was a good base to land,
if that's OK.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/84-0
00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:18.883
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. And we talked about the dispatch,
yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/85-0
00:17:21.163 --> 00:17:25.559
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, I mean, two reasons,
many reasons that I'm aware of that we</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/85-1
00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:28.787
<v Josh Sparkes>process it,
those invoices in different teams.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/85-2
00:17:28.787 --> 00:17:34.212
<v Josh Sparkes>One that's a bit more of a traditional
view of how Australian AP is structured</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/85-3
00:17:34.212 --> 00:17:36.203
<v Josh Sparkes>in general. So all law firms.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/86-0
00:17:36.643 --> 00:17:40.113
<v Josh Sparkes>In Australia,
you would generally find the accounts</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/86-1
00:17:40.113 --> 00:17:45.049
<v Josh Sparkes>payable team process all types of
invoices rather than separating out the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/86-2
00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:48.452
<v Josh Sparkes>different types,
whereas over the UK the cashiers,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/86-3
00:17:48.452 --> 00:17:53.655
<v Josh Sparkes>because the majority of the work that
cashier Cashiering team does a law firm</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/86-4
00:17:53.655 --> 00:17:55.923
<v Josh Sparkes>is to do with client monies to do.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/87-0
00:17:56.723 --> 00:18:02.758
<v Josh Sparkes>With legal matters to do with receiving
funds from received from both from</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/87-1
00:18:02.758 --> 00:18:08.228
<v Josh Sparkes>clients, and that has it's developed,
that's kind of it. Naturally,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/87-2
00:18:08.228 --> 00:18:10.883
<v Josh Sparkes>in that their process as well so.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/88-0
00:18:11.243 --> 00:18:16.973
<v Josh Sparkes>That's really why why we've done it like
that at the end of the day, OK,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/88-1
00:18:16.973 --> 00:18:19.563
<v Josh Sparkes>anything else you want to add on?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/89-0
00:18:22.203 --> 00:18:26.343
<v Josh Sparkes>The cost to be processed in the UK set of
cashiers as well,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/89-1
00:18:26.343 --> 00:18:31.380
<v Josh Sparkes>because regulatory and they'll see about
regulatory environments in SRA,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/89-2
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.900
<v Josh Sparkes>although we will charge costs on to our
client that we will not pay those costs</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/89-3
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.763
<v Josh Sparkes>until the client pays us as soon as the
client pays us.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/90-0
00:18:41.003 --> 00:18:45.302
<v Josh Sparkes>The clock starts ticking that we have to
then pay those funds out to the 4th party</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/90-1
00:18:45.302 --> 00:18:47.995
<v Josh Sparkes>and and this came that all doing money
set in Asha.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/90-2
00:18:47.995 --> 00:18:50.430
<v Josh Sparkes>So an account is considered to client's
money.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/90-3
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:54.573
<v Josh Sparkes>So we want to manage that to make sure
this process properly and if there's any</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/90-4
00:18:54.573 --> 00:18:57.163
<v Josh Sparkes>problems we would then share the money
from Asha.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/90-5
00:18:57.163 --> 00:18:58.923
<v Josh Sparkes>So an account to a client account.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/92-0
00:18:59.363 --> 00:19:02.243
<v Josh Sparkes>So if it's all called,
didn't miss on Earth,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/92-1
00:19:02.243 --> 00:19:07.555
<v Josh Sparkes>make it with the requirements you know,
I'll think say it quite a few times today.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/92-2
00:19:07.555 --> 00:19:10.691
<v Josh Sparkes>That's fine.
And that's so that's different from</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/92-3
00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:14.659
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia. So that's yeah.
So I was going to say because Josh</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/92-4
00:19:14.659 --> 00:19:16.003
<v Josh Sparkes>mentioned previously.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/93-0
00:19:17.203 --> 00:19:23.256
<v Josh Sparkes>That what things can be streamlined and
what we can't streamline so just a bit</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/93-1
00:19:23.256 --> 00:19:29.385
<v Josh Sparkes>back a little bit of a backdrop is that
we in the UK are governed by SRA and we</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/93-2
00:19:29.385 --> 00:19:35.283
<v Josh Sparkes>have like external audits and like proper
key audits on the caching process.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/94-0
00:19:35.923 --> 00:19:41.509
<v Josh Sparkes>Whereas in Oz you don't have one
regulatory body covering the whole of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/94-1
00:19:41.509 --> 00:19:47.882
<v Josh Sparkes>laws, it's split across the five states.
And so there's a difference between the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/94-2
00:19:47.882 --> 00:19:52.523
<v Josh Sparkes>regulation or regulatory requirements
between laws and UK.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/95-0
00:19:53.043 --> 00:19:57.160
<v Josh Sparkes>But at the same time in OS,
there are five jurisdictions which the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/95-1
00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.075
<v Josh Sparkes>guys have to follow and so there will be
slight smaller differences in in their</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/95-2
00:20:02.075 --> 00:20:05.393
<v Josh Sparkes>requirements as well.
And but then there are some key</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/95-3
00:20:05.393 --> 00:20:08.834
<v Josh Sparkes>differences between OS and the UK.
So there are layers.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/95-4
00:20:08.834 --> 00:20:12.643
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's where you will see that Tom
quite often regulatory.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/96-0
00:20:12.683 --> 00:20:17.213
<v Josh Sparkes>Requirement but then it doesn't mean that
she would and I would have the same</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/96-1
00:20:17.213 --> 00:20:21.393
<v Josh Sparkes>requirement as Martin. But again,
it would be interesting to understand</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/96-2
00:20:21.393 --> 00:20:24.761
<v Josh Sparkes>that as a best practise,
can we adopt each or vice versa.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/96-3
00:20:24.761 --> 00:20:28.942
<v Josh Sparkes>You know of of the regulatory
requirements or can we streamline that or</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/96-4
00:20:28.942 --> 00:20:32.483
<v Josh Sparkes>not but there will be some challenges in
doing that as well.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/98-0
00:20:32.843 --> 00:20:36.377
<v Josh Sparkes>People decides. Yeah. OK.
And your workflow could possibly,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/98-1
00:20:36.377 --> 00:20:39.439
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
maybe start saying that you're processing</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/98-2
00:20:39.439 --> 00:20:43.620
<v Josh Sparkes>and then it splits to meet that
regulatory and get that work on these.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/98-3
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:48.037
<v Josh Sparkes>com all day. Now regulatory for that,
you're still it's still an action of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/98-4
00:20:48.037 --> 00:20:51.452
<v Josh Sparkes>meeting. You know,
whichever country you're in your chair</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/98-5
00:20:51.452 --> 00:20:51.923
<v Josh Sparkes>meeting.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/99-0
00:20:52.203 --> 00:20:55.503
<v Josh Sparkes>I think standards I think yes,
that is a state potentially and then</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/99-1
00:20:55.503 --> 00:20:58.658
<v Josh Sparkes>composed and then maybe there's
differences that we can capture,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/99-2
00:20:58.658 --> 00:21:01.424
<v Josh Sparkes>but it can still be a state as it doesn't
say. But yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/99-3
00:21:01.424 --> 00:21:04.676
<v Josh Sparkes>so typically you have this kind of global
standard that you apply,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/99-4
00:21:04.676 --> 00:21:08.364
<v Josh Sparkes>but you might have a certain task that
you might need to trigger because it</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/99-5
00:21:08.364 --> 00:21:12.003
<v Josh Sparkes>needs certain additional details from a
regulatory compliance perspective.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/100-0
00:21:12.043 --> 00:21:14.847
<v Josh Sparkes>As well,
so we we we have base foundation global</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/100-1
00:21:14.847 --> 00:21:19.366
<v Josh Sparkes>standards and then the offshoots are to
allow for the the regulatory pieces as</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/100-2
00:21:19.366 --> 00:21:22.055
<v Josh Sparkes>well,
yes and but in some of the key processes</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/100-3
00:21:22.055 --> 00:21:26.289
<v Josh Sparkes>like payments as well like we were
talking like yesterday and our team is</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/100-4
00:21:26.289 --> 00:21:30.465
<v Josh Sparkes>able to process the payment over there
like 3 people within the finance.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/100-5
00:21:30.465 --> 00:21:31.723
<v Josh Sparkes>But whereas over here.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/101-0
00:21:32.123 --> 00:21:35.290
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just me. Yeah,
because the whole of the final.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/101-1
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:39.797
<v Josh Sparkes>So because that is a regulatory
requirement that these guys can't process</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/101-2
00:21:39.797 --> 00:21:41.563
<v Josh Sparkes>and and you know somehow the.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/102-0
00:21:43.243 --> 00:21:48.001
<v Josh Sparkes>To be the Chief Finance Office works as
well. It's it's like more on the UK side.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/102-1
00:21:48.001 --> 00:21:52.642
<v Josh Sparkes>If there's more strictness compared to in
the OS because of whatever the reason</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/102-2
00:21:52.642 --> 00:21:55.949
<v Josh Sparkes>would be the the,
the ways of working basically which we</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/102-3
00:21:55.949 --> 00:21:59.603
<v Josh Sparkes>would want to change if there is a,
there's a possibility and.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/103-0
00:22:00.203 --> 00:22:03.356
<v Josh Sparkes>But again,
there's a big mindset difference in the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/103-1
00:22:03.356 --> 00:22:07.003
<v Josh Sparkes>way the partners would expect a pavement
to be dealt with,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/103-2
00:22:07.003 --> 00:22:11.454
<v Josh Sparkes>and also compared to over a year. Yeah.
Listen, Sir. Yeah. As you said,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/103-3
00:22:11.454 --> 00:22:15.534
<v Josh Sparkes>you're bound by, you know,
regulatory or compliance issues legal,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/103-4
00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:19.923
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, you through your work there,
you have to comply to that. So.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/104-0
00:22:20.083 --> 00:22:24.673
<v Josh Sparkes>It's something that you probably as you
said, you can't change necessarily,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/104-1
00:22:24.673 --> 00:22:28.477
<v Josh Sparkes>but it will still be a common workflow
state, you know comply,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/104-2
00:22:28.477 --> 00:22:32.281
<v Josh Sparkes>but everyone's call it.
But because of your assignment groups,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/104-3
00:22:32.281 --> 00:22:35.843
<v Josh Sparkes>you would logically service that would
logically give you.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/105-0
00:22:36.283 --> 00:22:40.940
<v Josh Sparkes>Naturally, what's applicable to yourself?
What's applicable to Australia?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/105-1
00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:45.534
<v Josh Sparkes>And then once that's completed,
then flows back into the global view and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/105-2
00:22:45.534 --> 00:22:49.562
<v Josh Sparkes>then it continues as well. Yeah. Yeah.
And both both the teams,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/105-3
00:22:49.562 --> 00:22:52.960
<v Josh Sparkes>both the locations,
they are very dynamic in terms of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/105-4
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.043
<v Josh Sparkes>implementing any changes.
The reason is because.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/106-0
00:22:56.123 --> 00:23:00.189
<v Josh Sparkes>Because we are heavily scrutinised from
our external auditors,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/106-1
00:23:00.189 --> 00:23:05.286
<v Josh Sparkes>so whatever audit recommendations would
be, we would straight away jump on it,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/106-2
00:23:05.286 --> 00:23:08.577
<v Josh Sparkes>we would try and fix that.
That's I shouldn't say.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/106-3
00:23:08.577 --> 00:23:13.803
<v Josh Sparkes>But in that context I'm not concerned
about whether my process is global or not.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/107-0
00:23:14.243 --> 00:23:18.819
<v Josh Sparkes>Because it is such a high risk process,
I want to make sure my process is more</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/107-1
00:23:18.819 --> 00:23:23.106
<v Josh Sparkes>compliant in that jurisdiction or not
coming. I mean stream streamlining.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/107-2
00:23:23.106 --> 00:23:26.002
<v Josh Sparkes>That is my second salinity.
If there's an option,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/107-3
00:23:26.002 --> 00:23:29.303
<v Josh Sparkes>but I'm not with other teams. Yes,
I am focused on that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/107-4
00:23:29.303 --> 00:23:33.010
<v Josh Sparkes>But with this team like no,
you have to hit your regulatory for</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/107-5
00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:33.763
<v Josh Sparkes>process, yes.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/108-0
00:23:33.803 --> 00:23:37.745
<v Josh Sparkes>Exactly. Yeah. Because it's heavy,
heavily regulated, you know,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/108-1
00:23:37.745 --> 00:23:41.316
<v Josh Sparkes>and these guys,
they speak to the general consuls day in,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/108-2
00:23:41.316 --> 00:23:46.119
<v Josh Sparkes>day out, every day, and then, you know,
there's a lot more of risk over here.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/108-3
00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:50.430
<v Josh Sparkes>But with the big depend effect,
the work they do and I feel proud and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/108-4
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.523
<v Josh Sparkes>saying that in both the locations.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/109-0
00:23:53.443 --> 00:23:58.100
<v Josh Sparkes>The external audit has been spotless.
We are termed Azure's cashiering.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/109-1
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:02.886
<v Josh Sparkes>Services are termed as one of one of the
best in among the lead among the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/109-2
00:24:02.886 --> 00:24:07.737
<v Josh Sparkes>competitors. I mean this is not us.
This is like Deloitte and our external</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/109-3
00:24:07.737 --> 00:24:11.877
<v Josh Sparkes>just testing us. Yeah.
So I guess the principle that we need to</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/109-4
00:24:11.877 --> 00:24:12.523
<v Josh Sparkes>show that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/110-0
00:24:13.123 --> 00:24:16.190
<v Josh Sparkes>Particularly,
this function is about how to respond to</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/110-1
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.257
<v Josh Sparkes>audit and compliance,
and then as the global piece and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/110-2
00:24:19.257 --> 00:24:23.439
<v Josh Sparkes>standardisation is a second priority
rather than that as a principle, yes,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/110-3
00:24:23.439 --> 00:24:26.785
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean now, although as we said,
we're looking at workflow,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/110-4
00:24:26.785 --> 00:24:31.134
<v Josh Sparkes>it doesn't simplify actually it can
empower your supporting evidence for that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/110-5
00:24:31.134 --> 00:24:31.803
<v Josh Sparkes>audit trail.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/111-0
00:24:32.203 --> 00:24:36.215
<v Josh Sparkes>So I want to give that message now.
I've been clear that it's not stripping</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/111-1
00:24:36.215 --> 00:24:39.066
<v Josh Sparkes>down the functionality,
it actually enhanced it more.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/111-2
00:24:39.066 --> 00:24:42.972
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can go in and there's that
checklist that you've got, as you said,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/111-3
00:24:42.972 --> 00:24:45.981
<v Josh Sparkes>when you're audited,
you've got metrics to support that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/111-4
00:24:45.981 --> 00:24:48.409
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
they weren't added after the event.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/111-5
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:51.523
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, you can see that.
Actually we didn't retrospect.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/112-0
00:24:51.803 --> 00:24:55.392
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean there will be gaps afterwards.
It's actually during a time stamp</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/112-1
00:24:55.392 --> 00:24:58.532
<v Josh Sparkes>supporting influence.
It's all there for taking operationally.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/112-2
00:24:58.532 --> 00:25:00.725
<v Josh Sparkes>There will be few points,
few dots to join.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/112-3
00:25:00.725 --> 00:25:03.466
<v Josh Sparkes>Hence Chris is here as well.
He's from credit control.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/112-4
00:25:03.466 --> 00:25:06.955
<v Josh Sparkes>But then there is a process which
overlaps between credit control and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/112-5
00:25:06.955 --> 00:25:07.403
<v Josh Sparkes>cashiers.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/113-0
00:25:07.603 --> 00:25:11.037
<v Josh Sparkes>In both the locations and then the team
do work hand in hand,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/113-1
00:25:11.037 --> 00:25:15.134
<v Josh Sparkes>so you know those are the areas which we
would kind of like say yeah, OK,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/113-2
00:25:15.134 --> 00:25:18.955
<v Josh Sparkes>how can ServiceNow, you know,
give us that bandwidth to kind of like</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/113-3
00:25:18.955 --> 00:25:23.219
<v Josh Sparkes>you know have a better ways of work in.
Yes for that check. Absolutely. Yep,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/113-4
00:25:23.219 --> 00:25:23.883
<v Josh Sparkes>that's good.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/114-0
00:25:26.363 --> 00:25:31.497
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, so I did see on that.
Note that actually all the processes were</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/114-1
00:25:31.497 --> 00:25:35.573
<v Josh Sparkes>captured in two,
unlike evening and the best accounts</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/114-2
00:25:35.573 --> 00:25:41.763
<v Josh Sparkes>payable we had a portfolio of processes
that we could combine. We could see them.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/115-0
00:25:42.083 --> 00:25:45.346
<v Josh Sparkes>Actually in cashewing they were two
different files,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/115-1
00:25:45.346 --> 00:25:48.239
<v Josh Sparkes>but we brought them together for
conversation.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/115-2
00:25:48.239 --> 00:25:52.978
<v Josh Sparkes>Now you may say these are our differences
and that's actually perfectly fine</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/115-3
00:25:52.978 --> 00:25:56.794
<v Josh Sparkes>because we can, as you said,
it's an audit and the regulatory</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/115-4
00:25:56.794 --> 00:25:57.963
<v Josh Sparkes>importance on this.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/116-0
00:25:58.683 --> 00:26:02.444
<v Josh Sparkes>I I mean this is sort of the services
that we have.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/116-1
00:26:02.444 --> 00:26:07.144
<v Josh Sparkes>I've seen all the sort of client accounts,
the trustee accounts,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/116-2
00:26:07.144 --> 00:26:12.930
<v Josh Sparkes>lots of managed pin up systems as well
that offers accounting and managing that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/116-3
00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:13.363
<v Josh Sparkes>money.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/117-0
00:26:13.883 --> 00:26:19.379
<v Josh Sparkes>Within the office. So if you don't mind,
I sort of thought maybe we could start</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/117-1
00:26:19.379 --> 00:26:22.608
<v Josh Sparkes>with the client and travel account
management.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/117-2
00:26:22.608 --> 00:26:27.623
<v Josh Sparkes>Would that be a natural place to start?
It's definitely important. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/117-3
00:26:27.623 --> 00:26:32.363
<v Josh Sparkes>If the key tasks that fall outside of a
traditional cashiering task.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/118-0
00:26:33.243 --> 00:26:37.796
<v Josh Sparkes>Where we're seeing like the ad hoc
billing support in OPS, yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/118-1
00:26:37.796 --> 00:26:42.558
<v Josh Sparkes>that is exclusively Australia,
where specific teams in the UK to do</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/118-2
00:26:42.558 --> 00:26:46.340
<v Josh Sparkes>those tasks.
So you'll have the billing team later on</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/118-3
00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:51.663
<v Josh Sparkes>this week that will cover some of that
billing support that the cashiers in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/118-4
00:26:51.663 --> 00:26:52.363
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/119-0
00:26:52.483 --> 00:26:57.044
<v Josh Sparkes>Your team do just because we,
as the Australian partners,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/119-1
00:26:57.044 --> 00:27:00.503
<v Josh Sparkes>manage their billing differently to the
UK.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/119-2
00:27:00.503 --> 00:27:05.064
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've got one central billing team in
the UK to build.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/119-3
00:27:05.064 --> 00:27:10.803
<v Josh Sparkes>It's all localised with the partners and
their EAS to do the billing so.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/120-0
00:27:11.683 --> 00:27:14.234
<v Josh Sparkes>There's no all billing function in
Australia,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/120-1
00:27:14.234 --> 00:27:18.725
<v Josh Sparkes>but there needs to be billing support and
we haven't seen there's been a need to</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/120-2
00:27:18.725 --> 00:27:21.996
<v Josh Sparkes>have it extended.
Only team in Australia so that sits with</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/120-3
00:27:21.996 --> 00:27:26.043
<v Josh Sparkes>cashiers. Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah.
Really well explanation. That's good.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/121-0
00:27:26.803 --> 00:27:29.767
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
Because globally I'm like that's billing,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/121-1
00:27:29.767 --> 00:27:32.795
<v Josh Sparkes>you know? Yeah.
So we did not file to clarify,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/121-2
00:27:32.795 --> 00:27:38.207
<v Josh Sparkes>there will be some crossover with all the
other teams that you'll probably see this</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/121-3
00:27:38.207 --> 00:27:41.106
<v Josh Sparkes>week,
next week and it's just because of the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/121-4
00:27:41.106 --> 00:27:42.523
<v Josh Sparkes>size of Australia and.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/122-0
00:27:42.923 --> 00:27:45.852
<v Josh Sparkes>Versus size of the UK and and set up a
point. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/122-1
00:27:45.852 --> 00:27:49.795
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's reassuring to hear is even if
we go through the workshops.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/122-2
00:27:49.795 --> 00:27:53.963
<v Josh Sparkes>But the functions aren't mutually
exclusive, you know, they're not there.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/123-0
00:27:55.243 --> 00:27:59.530
<v Josh Sparkes>So with nice neat swim lanes,
there is that dependency as a end to end</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/123-1
00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.549
<v Josh Sparkes>process. So yeah, that's good. OK,
so as we said,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/123-2
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:06.111
<v Josh Sparkes>so I've put in this client and traffic
account management,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/123-3
00:28:06.111 --> 00:28:10.519
<v Josh Sparkes>there's probably client management,
classic account management which say</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/123-4
00:28:10.519 --> 00:28:11.243
<v Josh Sparkes>they're two.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/124-0
00:28:11.683 --> 00:28:15.329
<v Josh Sparkes>Separate things,
but I've combined them as sort of service,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/124-1
00:28:15.329 --> 00:28:19.339
<v Josh Sparkes>but maybe we could speak to that and
you've got multiple process,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/124-2
00:28:19.339 --> 00:28:23.106
<v Josh Sparkes>some of them queries,
some of them controlled money interest,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/124-3
00:28:23.106 --> 00:28:26.994
<v Josh Sparkes>but we just talk maybe at both levels for
the UK and Australia,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/124-4
00:28:26.994 --> 00:28:29.363
<v Josh Sparkes>your processes go through that to date.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/125-0
00:28:29.883 --> 00:28:30.003
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/126-0
00:28:30.403 --> 00:28:33.112
<v Josh Sparkes>On a trust account,
the same thing exactly. OK,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/126-1
00:28:33.112 --> 00:28:36.385
<v Josh Sparkes>just to clarify now, OK,
as I went through the processes,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/126-2
00:28:36.385 --> 00:28:39.940
<v Josh Sparkes>it was just it's terminal actually the
world they were called,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/126-3
00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:44.285
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's ineffective the same thing.
So just the UK calls blind accounts was</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/126-4
00:28:44.285 --> 00:28:46.824
<v Josh Sparkes>called trust account. Yeah, that's it.
Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/126-5
00:28:46.824 --> 00:28:49.363
<v Josh Sparkes>And would you therefore moving forward as
a?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/127-0
00:28:50.203 --> 00:28:53.680
<v Josh Sparkes>Terminal as a service.
You should call it traffic help,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/127-1
00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.584
<v Josh Sparkes>measure or client, because it's actually.
I've always had this debate with the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/127-2
00:28:58.584 --> 00:29:03.116
<v Josh Sparkes>partners wherever you are in the world
will have their preference. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/127-3
00:29:03.116 --> 00:29:06.158
<v Josh Sparkes>Or it's an Australian.
Like we're just thinking,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/127-4
00:29:06.158 --> 00:29:09.323
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm happy to call the client money
because I know.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/128-0
00:29:09.963 --> 00:29:16.712
<v Josh Sparkes>That that's very clash. So yeah,
purely clanked money in that if anything</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/128-1
00:29:16.712 --> 00:29:22.914
<v Josh Sparkes>else goes in, it's a breach.
Just one thing to factor in that is if</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/128-2
00:29:22.914 --> 00:29:25.923
<v Josh Sparkes>you're going to have inputs from.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/129-0
00:29:26.683 --> 00:29:30.139
<v Josh Sparkes>You know parts or PES and they're going
to be going into the dashboard and they</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/129-1
00:29:30.139 --> 00:29:32.126
<v Josh Sparkes>go panel.
It just needs to be relative to the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/129-2
00:29:32.126 --> 00:29:35.408
<v Josh Sparkes>ceremonology for that region. Yeah,
absolutely. Gloves and appreciate that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/129-3
00:29:35.408 --> 00:29:38.907
<v Josh Sparkes>But there needs to be the partners needs
to know what they're thinking about it.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/129-4
00:29:38.907 --> 00:29:41.843
<v Josh Sparkes>They might not know it. Yeah, I know.
It's very simple to ask, but.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/130-0
00:29:42.563 --> 00:29:47.791
<v Josh Sparkes>So Catherine will will wonderful world
very, very softest challenge later. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/130-1
00:29:47.791 --> 00:29:52.051
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, it's but not the factory.
Just so you're aware. Well,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/130-2
00:29:52.051 --> 00:29:55.472
<v Josh Sparkes>I've I've come both then. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. OK good.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/130-3
00:29:55.472 --> 00:29:58.763
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you just talk to that closely today.
So you.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/131-0
00:29:59.203 --> 00:30:03.555
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there a creative old onboarding or
where's the immature trigger of that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/131-1
00:30:03.555 --> 00:30:07.036
<v Josh Sparkes>account management?
Or where does it come from? Councillor?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/131-2
00:30:07.036 --> 00:30:10.634
<v Josh Sparkes>What about the client?
You're saying the client account? Yes.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/131-3
00:30:10.634 --> 00:30:15.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you have to manage any of the accounts
set up or you're just managing the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/131-4
00:30:15.101 --> 00:30:16.203
<v Josh Sparkes>transactional side?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/132-0
00:30:19.563 --> 00:30:25.500
<v Josh Sparkes>The the DMA involves so a control money's
account involves an account creation,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/132-1
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:30.843
<v Josh Sparkes>but you guys are UK doesn't have that
many of them. Australia has more.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/134-0
00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:35.749
<v Josh Sparkes>He depends on interest rates and end up
using the water or this often.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/134-1
00:30:35.749 --> 00:30:38.779
<v Josh Sparkes>But I mean premises,
we've got accounts set up already like</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/134-2
00:30:38.779 --> 00:30:42.667
<v Josh Sparkes>the main accounts are set up and you just
deal with the transactions that go</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/134-3
00:30:42.667 --> 00:30:46.000
<v Josh Sparkes>through those accounts.
But from time to time we will have to set</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/134-4
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.363
<v Josh Sparkes>up some accounts we've got.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/135-0
00:30:47.763 --> 00:30:51.509
<v Josh Sparkes>Banking platforms that was just to do
that, but from what you were saying,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/135-1
00:30:51.509 --> 00:30:54.656
<v Josh Sparkes>no on board and you know that we we're
not involved with that,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/135-2
00:30:54.656 --> 00:30:58.652
<v Josh Sparkes>that's that's sort of kind of apartment
level to on board their own clients and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/135-3
00:30:58.652 --> 00:31:02.647
<v Josh Sparkes>decide if accounts need to be used for
transactional properties and then that's</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/135-4
00:31:02.647 --> 00:31:06.243
<v Josh Sparkes>when we get brought into they do all that
yeah that's been done before.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/136-0
00:31:07.283 --> 00:31:11.700
<v Josh Sparkes>And so is there a situation where you
know you're managing money and you sort</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/136-1
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:16.344
<v Josh Sparkes>of think other accounts doesn't exist or
it's not active or is there any of those</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/136-2
00:31:16.344 --> 00:31:18.949
<v Josh Sparkes>cheques that come into that?
I'd say it's it.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/136-3
00:31:18.949 --> 00:31:21.723
<v Josh Sparkes>There's nothing that's an account doesn't
exist.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/137-0
00:31:22.443 --> 00:31:28.019
<v Josh Sparkes>It would be that we have to be careful
that a legal matter is open before we can</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/137-1
00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:32.906
<v Josh Sparkes>receive client money into our account.
That's probably the main thing.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/137-2
00:31:32.906 --> 00:31:36.486
<v Josh Sparkes>If we cannot accept client money into our
accounts.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/137-3
00:31:36.486 --> 00:31:41.923
<v Josh Sparkes>If the matter is not open because it just
means it hasn't gone through recent.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/138-0
00:31:42.003 --> 00:31:45.520
<v Josh Sparkes>Clients. It hasn't gone through its QA,
so OK,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/138-1
00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.983
<v Josh Sparkes>does everybody understand what client is?
So with the explanation, yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/138-2
00:31:50.983 --> 00:31:53.003
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe ensuring explanation.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/139-0
00:31:58.043 --> 00:32:01.715
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've got, as we said,
client a trust account and then we've got</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/139-1
00:32:01.715 --> 00:32:04.847
<v Josh Sparkes>him office sort of farm account is that
we use Australia.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/139-2
00:32:04.847 --> 00:32:07.330
<v Josh Sparkes>So the office and farm account is like
Ashes,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/139-3
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:11.488
<v Josh Sparkes>own money like we get our bills paid,
all that money comes in today and that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/139-4
00:32:11.488 --> 00:32:12.243
<v Josh Sparkes>belongs to us.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/140-0
00:32:12.683 --> 00:32:16.632
<v Josh Sparkes>But as a client account has money that
belongs to a client and it's held and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/140-1
00:32:16.632 --> 00:32:20.120
<v Josh Sparkes>it's on separate accounts.
So it's ring fenced from ashes money and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/140-2
00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.453
<v Josh Sparkes>it's protected by the banks.
So for law firms to go to business,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/140-3
00:32:23.453 --> 00:32:26.274
<v Josh Sparkes>for example,
all the money that's held for clients has</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/140-4
00:32:26.274 --> 00:32:29.043
<v Josh Sparkes>kind of safeguarded and kept them half
those clients.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/140-5
00:32:29.043 --> 00:32:31.043
<v Josh Sparkes>So I guess a layman's tale for that is.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/141-0
00:32:31.483 --> 00:32:35.496
<v Josh Sparkes>If you were buying a house,
you bought a house for, say, quarter £1,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/141-1
00:32:35.496 --> 00:32:38.346
<v Josh Sparkes>000,000, you've got to put in £100,
000 deposit.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/141-2
00:32:38.346 --> 00:32:43.114
<v Josh Sparkes>You there would be a you'd be set up as a
client on a best specific matter opened</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/141-3
00:32:43.114 --> 00:32:47.243
<v Josh Sparkes>up for you to do with the house that
you're purchasing you would send.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/142-0
00:32:47.643 --> 00:32:50.289
<v Josh Sparkes>The £100,
000 deposit into a client account and I'd</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/142-1
00:32:50.289 --> 00:32:54.053
<v Josh Sparkes>be allocated against your matter,
but although certainly national account</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/142-2
00:32:54.053 --> 00:32:58.021
<v Josh Sparkes>is still your money on the day of the
House sale, you would get another £150,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/142-3
00:32:58.021 --> 00:33:01.887
<v Josh Sparkes>000 from the bank that you're getting a
mortgage from and that quarter of a</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/142-4
00:33:01.887 --> 00:33:05.498
<v Josh Sparkes>million pounding gets sent to the
solicitors of the person selling the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/142-5
00:33:05.498 --> 00:33:05.803
<v Josh Sparkes>House.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/143-0
00:33:06.123 --> 00:33:09.095
<v Josh Sparkes>And so that money risk realised and then
rested.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/143-1
00:33:09.095 --> 00:33:12.491
<v Josh Sparkes>Other clients solicitor until it's all
distributed. OK.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/143-2
00:33:12.491 --> 00:33:17.039
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know if that's a you saw an
explanation. So of that analogy. Yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/143-3
00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:19.768
<v Josh Sparkes>right.
I don't know if you guys are the Cass</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/143-4
00:33:19.768 --> 00:33:24.740
<v Josh Sparkes>regulations like with the OR any of the
banks like in the UK coming by the FCA so</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/143-5
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.043
<v Josh Sparkes>like.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/144-0
00:33:25.563 --> 00:33:29.584
<v Josh Sparkes>The client money for see,
we deal back to investment back.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/144-1
00:33:29.584 --> 00:33:33.672
<v Josh Sparkes>So the cast regulations it's,
it's very identical to those,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/144-2
00:33:33.672 --> 00:33:39.055
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's more stringent because over here
the lawyers or the solicitors or the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/144-3
00:33:39.055 --> 00:33:42.598
<v Josh Sparkes>partners,
they have the privilege to take the money</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/144-4
00:33:42.598 --> 00:33:45.323
<v Josh Sparkes>on those matters on the cases on behalf.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/145-0
00:33:45.403 --> 00:33:48.202
<v Josh Sparkes>Of the client.
And whereas you know for the retail</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/145-1
00:33:48.202 --> 00:33:51.275
<v Josh Sparkes>investment bank,
you're depositing your own investment,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/145-2
00:33:51.275 --> 00:33:55.884
<v Josh Sparkes>but over here you are taking money from A
to give it to B or the matter of closure.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/145-3
00:33:55.884 --> 00:33:58.518
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
once the deal signs off the the rules</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/145-4
00:33:58.518 --> 00:34:00.603
<v Josh Sparkes>over here are slightly more stringent.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/146-0
00:34:02.803 --> 00:34:07.371
<v Josh Sparkes>The sound like the like we were talking
yesterday. For one invoice,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/146-1
00:34:07.371 --> 00:34:11.602
<v Josh Sparkes>one payment and then there's business
rules that exclude that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/146-2
00:34:11.602 --> 00:34:17.243
<v Josh Sparkes>So this is the matter has to be active in
all prior to any money being transferred.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/147-0
00:34:17.563 --> 00:34:20.885
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. And you can have multiple masses,
presumably for that. Yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/147-1
00:34:20.885 --> 00:34:24.157
<v Josh Sparkes>for that client. So I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm just going a step back.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/147-2
00:34:24.157 --> 00:34:26.686
<v Josh Sparkes>You asked that.
How does these account get set up?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/147-3
00:34:26.686 --> 00:34:30.206
<v Josh Sparkes>And also when there is a client
discussion happening or when there's a</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/147-4
00:34:30.206 --> 00:34:33.776
<v Josh Sparkes>deal happening, etcetera, etcetera,
there is a form called new business</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/147-5
00:34:33.776 --> 00:34:36.403
<v Josh Sparkes>initiative form,
nvi from what we call so the front.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/148-0
00:34:37.403 --> 00:34:37.483
<v Josh Sparkes>The.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/149-0
00:34:37.803 --> 00:34:42.267
<v Josh Sparkes>We will be initiating those discussions
in on different teams in a bit with the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/149-1
00:34:42.267 --> 00:34:45.559
<v Josh Sparkes>client the the form is some 6017 and 90
page long as well.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/149-2
00:34:45.559 --> 00:34:50.079
<v Josh Sparkes>So that will capture some of the banking
details and then some of the tick boxes</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/149-3
00:34:50.079 --> 00:34:54.097
<v Josh Sparkes>like you know are you able to process on
as well as such and such bank,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/149-4
00:34:54.097 --> 00:34:57.333
<v Josh Sparkes>what people etcetera,
etcetera that goes through this can</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/149-5
00:34:57.333 --> 00:34:57.723
<v Josh Sparkes>comply.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/150-0
00:34:57.803 --> 00:35:01.353
<v Josh Sparkes>And so CG, the whole thing.
So that gets signed off and that is also</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/150-1
00:35:01.353 --> 00:35:05.109
<v Josh Sparkes>kind of like secure like all all the
terms and references and engagement</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/150-2
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:09.224
<v Josh Sparkes>letters and everything is they're done
and tested before the actual transaction</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/150-3
00:35:09.224 --> 00:35:12.516
<v Josh Sparkes>would would come in play.
Where do they store all the patterns?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/150-4
00:35:12.516 --> 00:35:15.397
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a library,
I just as a library which stores all</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/150-5
00:35:15.397 --> 00:35:17.043
<v Josh Sparkes>those client documents you know.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/151-0
00:35:18.003 --> 00:35:21.997
<v Josh Sparkes>So then all matters and all the work is
set up through a chat so that this case</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/151-1
00:35:21.997 --> 00:35:24.993
<v Josh Sparkes>all the information,
not just with large account inflation,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/151-2
00:35:24.993 --> 00:35:28.787
<v Josh Sparkes>everything you say about that matter,
second class can go and do the record</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/151-3
00:35:28.787 --> 00:35:31.133
<v Josh Sparkes>corrects.
Do you ever going to need to get the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/151-4
00:35:31.133 --> 00:35:34.478
<v Josh Sparkes>accounts payable, content,
anything you need to generally gathered</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/151-5
00:35:34.478 --> 00:35:37.323
<v Josh Sparkes>in those forms and all that information
figures through?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/152-0
00:35:37.403 --> 00:35:39.043
<v Josh Sparkes>Various systems we have, OK.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/153-0
00:35:40.843 --> 00:35:44.288
<v Josh Sparkes>That the guys don't see that,
but of course it's a engagement letter</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/153-1
00:35:44.288 --> 00:35:47.432
<v Josh Sparkes>which requires like, say,
somebody's authorised signatories et</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/153-2
00:35:47.432 --> 00:35:51.026
<v Josh Sparkes>cetera, to be verified, you know,
in in for a transaction then you know</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/153-3
00:35:51.026 --> 00:35:54.071
<v Josh Sparkes>they would have access to it.
But that step is already done,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/153-4
00:35:54.071 --> 00:35:58.163
<v Josh Sparkes>invested before we will start processing
the things you know. So type of process.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/154-0
00:35:59.363 --> 00:36:02.913
<v Josh Sparkes>There is a there is.
There's a situation where we would</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/154-1
00:36:02.913 --> 00:36:07.985
<v Josh Sparkes>process it. If the market is not wide,
but we will go through that if it comes,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/154-2
00:36:07.985 --> 00:36:11.852
<v Josh Sparkes>you know? Yeah. OK.
So in terms of how you see your request,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/154-3
00:36:11.852 --> 00:36:13.563
<v Josh Sparkes>I know that we've got some.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/155-0
00:36:14.523 --> 00:36:17.401
<v Josh Sparkes>Trust. Sorry,
sorry to so it's something this the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/155-1
00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:20.681
<v Josh Sparkes>source of truth.
The client numbers and things that will</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/155-2
00:36:20.681 --> 00:36:21.083
<v Josh Sparkes>in tap.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/156-0
00:36:22.803 --> 00:36:25.633
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, I mean it's also proof for what,
sorry.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/156-1
00:36:25.633 --> 00:36:30.915
<v Josh Sparkes>So we we said onboarding clients is until
we use is it at that point they get given</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/156-2
00:36:30.915 --> 00:36:35.945
<v Josh Sparkes>a client number I think so it's something
like a clue more number or something.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/156-3
00:36:35.945 --> 00:36:41.038
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah well it assigns it to a parent group.
So client might be assigned to like a</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/156-4
00:36:41.038 --> 00:36:41.603
<v Josh Sparkes>Barclays.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/157-0
00:36:42.723 --> 00:36:45.657
<v Josh Sparkes>US boxes Scotland doctor England,
for example,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/157-1
00:36:45.657 --> 00:36:48.965
<v Josh Sparkes>any groups together in one clue which is
overarched,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/157-2
00:36:48.965 --> 00:36:52.273
<v Josh Sparkes>but the actual setup of those clients
goes into 350.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/157-3
00:36:52.273 --> 00:36:56.268
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the numbers are individually
identified at three level.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/157-4
00:36:56.268 --> 00:37:01.074
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's where they're signed,
but that's a probably an IT question or</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/157-5
00:37:01.074 --> 00:37:01.323
<v Josh Sparkes>not.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/158-0
00:37:02.243 --> 00:37:05.872
<v Josh Sparkes>All right,
it does it down to a massive client level,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/158-1
00:37:05.872 --> 00:37:08.896
<v Josh Sparkes>so I think,
but that's probably to check the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/158-2
00:37:08.896 --> 00:37:14.407
<v Josh Sparkes>integrations bit between King, SAP and 3D,
we had to send the conversation on the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/158-3
00:37:14.407 --> 00:37:15.683
<v Josh Sparkes>billing, didn't we?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/159-0
00:37:20.923 --> 00:37:27.148
<v Josh Sparkes>I think I think that the the client and
the clue know is established in intact</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/159-1
00:37:27.148 --> 00:37:33.294
<v Josh Sparkes>because I think you could link them,
but I think the actual assignment of the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/159-2
00:37:33.294 --> 00:37:34.003
<v Josh Sparkes>physical.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/160-0
00:37:34.483 --> 00:37:38.898
<v Josh Sparkes>Number you know client number one I think
is done 3 and I think when intact you can</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/160-1
00:37:38.898 --> 00:37:43.259
<v Josh Sparkes>pick up see you have a client and you're
going to pick the from the drop down list</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/160-2
00:37:43.259 --> 00:37:45.887
<v Josh Sparkes>of clients and it'll give you a linked
clue note.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/160-3
00:37:45.887 --> 00:37:49.985
<v Josh Sparkes>And I think that pulls from three itself.
So I think as far as I know the two</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/160-4
00:37:49.985 --> 00:37:52.560
<v Josh Sparkes>integration,
but it's probably I see integrating</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/160-5
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.243
<v Josh Sparkes>conversation.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/161-0
00:37:54.163 --> 00:37:54.363
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/162-0
00:37:56.563 --> 00:38:00.231
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, thank you. OK.
So we can see that there's lots of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/162-1
00:38:00.231 --> 00:38:05.460
<v Josh Sparkes>requests that you get and you get them
today who chair one or how or e-mail.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/162-2
00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:10.825
<v Josh Sparkes>So what type of being to come into your
box and your activity that you have to</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/162-3
00:38:10.825 --> 00:38:14.221
<v Josh Sparkes>process.
So I think you've got like controlled on</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/162-4
00:38:14.221 --> 00:38:15.443
<v Josh Sparkes>the account query.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/163-0
00:38:15.963 --> 00:38:19.074
<v Josh Sparkes>Control money,
account interest and all money accounts,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/163-1
00:38:19.074 --> 00:38:22.184
<v Josh Sparkes>so there is this control money account
set up in there.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/163-2
00:38:22.184 --> 00:38:26.627
<v Josh Sparkes>So we're probably going through those
sort of different tasks that you've been,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/163-3
00:38:26.627 --> 00:38:29.182
<v Josh Sparkes>you know received to be processed daily
bank.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/163-4
00:38:29.182 --> 00:38:32.403
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that maybe we can talk about
reconciliation as a.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/164-0
00:38:33.523 --> 00:38:37.426
<v Josh Sparkes>Item,
But there's lots of pity if I look at it.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/164-1
00:38:37.426 --> 00:38:41.410
<v Josh Sparkes>Sort of.
It's that probably the work involved is</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/164-2
00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:46.776
<v Josh Sparkes>complex, essentially with that,
but to go through one sort of the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/164-3
00:38:46.776 --> 00:38:48.483
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow, so how you?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/165-0
00:38:49.203 --> 00:38:51.490
<v Josh Sparkes>Get your requests coming in and what they
look like,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/165-1
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.043
<v Josh Sparkes>those types of the breasts for that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/166-0
00:38:55.723 --> 00:38:55.883
<v Josh Sparkes>With.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/167-0
00:38:57.483 --> 00:39:00.898
<v Josh Sparkes>Where do you want to start?
Start to start.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/167-1
00:39:00.898 --> 00:39:06.718
<v Josh Sparkes>It's we started on the back of the,
you know, the types of payments. Yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/167-2
00:39:06.718 --> 00:39:12.305
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe. Yeah, that's it. Yeah.
So of business charges maybe in should we</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/167-3
00:39:12.305 --> 00:39:16.185
<v Josh Sparkes>do incoming?
How it's should we start with just a</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/167-4
00:39:16.185 --> 00:39:16.883
<v Josh Sparkes>standard.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/168-0
00:39:17.563 --> 00:39:25.316
<v Josh Sparkes>Client money's incoming. Yeah,
it's just an incoming process. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/168-1
00:39:25.316 --> 00:39:32.963
<v Josh Sparkes>Start with for client money's incoming.
We get an e-mail. Yeah, show up.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/169-0
00:39:34.243 --> 00:39:38.673
<v Josh Sparkes>And sell off the we're expecting money to
come into in Australia,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/169-1
00:39:38.673 --> 00:39:42.700
<v Josh Sparkes>we have to be told which trust account it
has to come into.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/169-2
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:47.801
<v Josh Sparkes>So Australia has four separate trust
accounts, Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/169-3
00:39:47.801 --> 00:39:48.203
<v Josh Sparkes>Perth.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/170-0
00:39:48.923 --> 00:39:52.645
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's because that's where our
office our offices are based and as</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/170-1
00:39:52.645 --> 00:39:55.281
<v Josh Sparkes>standard said before,
they're governed by separate</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/170-2
00:39:55.281 --> 00:39:58.641
<v Josh Sparkes>jurisdictions. So they four or five,
I was thinking here before,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/170-3
00:39:58.641 --> 00:40:02.466
<v Josh Sparkes>we've got ones closed now. Oh, OK,
because I'm thinking that each of them</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/170-4
00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:03.603
<v Josh Sparkes>relates to those five.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/171-0
00:40:04.843 --> 00:40:09.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Right. Yeah, poor, poor.
Now thankfully 1 less, but each. Yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/171-1
00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.971
<v Josh Sparkes>we have to have our four separate
accounts.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/171-2
00:40:12.971 --> 00:40:16.809
<v Josh Sparkes>We have to know which trust account it
comes into.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/171-3
00:40:16.809 --> 00:40:22.454
<v Josh Sparkes>So APE generally is the one that's
contacting sends an e-mail saying we're</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/171-4
00:40:22.454 --> 00:40:23.883
<v Josh Sparkes>expecting $100,000.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/172-0
00:40:23.923 --> 00:40:29.115
<v Josh Sparkes>Is coming into Melbourne trust account.
It's going to be from this person and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/172-1
00:40:29.115 --> 00:40:34.374
<v Josh Sparkes>it's going to come around this date. OK,
that's the bare minimum that we need.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/172-2
00:40:34.374 --> 00:40:38.900
<v Josh Sparkes>We cashiers will then if it we haven't
received it with the e-mail.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/172-3
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.763
<v Josh Sparkes>So there is a trust receipt.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/174-0
00:40:41.043 --> 00:40:45.485
<v Josh Sparkes>Form that we require that has the matter
information on it, all of the war,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/174-1
00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:50.219
<v Josh Sparkes>where what trust account is coming into
and and how much we're expecting to come</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/174-2
00:40:50.219 --> 00:40:52.791
<v Josh Sparkes>as well as some client information as
well.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/174-3
00:40:52.791 --> 00:40:57.466
<v Josh Sparkes>So that we can then match that off the
bank statement when it comes in provided</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/174-4
00:40:57.466 --> 00:41:00.563
<v Josh Sparkes>by the PE yeah provide that's provided by
the PE so.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/175-0
00:41:01.563 --> 00:41:05.501
<v Josh Sparkes>The ideal is that that comes we attached
with the e-mail that we get because we</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/175-1
00:41:05.501 --> 00:41:09.242
<v Josh Sparkes>also want to make sure that we're cross
checking what's in the form is also</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/175-2
00:41:09.242 --> 00:41:13.278
<v Josh Sparkes>what's in the e-mail and that's what's
we're expecting to be in our bank account.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/175-3
00:41:13.278 --> 00:41:15.443
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's almost like 3 way check that we
do.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/176-0
00:41:16.763 --> 00:41:19.735
<v Josh Sparkes>If we do not have that form received
initially,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/176-1
00:41:19.735 --> 00:41:24.377
<v Josh Sparkes>then we send that back to the PA to
complete before we receive that funds.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/176-2
00:41:24.377 --> 00:41:29.020
<v Josh Sparkes>So I mean the form or checklist or
something available at that point would</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/176-3
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Josh Sparkes>be helpful. Yeah. And I thought you said,
just say that point I think you mentioned</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/176-4
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.643
<v Josh Sparkes>the checklist that you.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/177-0
00:41:35.843 --> 00:41:39.938
<v Josh Sparkes>They have so that when the P instead of
sends you an e-mail.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/177-1
00:41:39.938 --> 00:41:43.965
<v Josh Sparkes>Obviously we're talking about replacing
it with ServiceNow.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/177-2
00:41:43.965 --> 00:41:47.926
<v Josh Sparkes>They're going to request that or
interrupt me at any time.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/177-3
00:41:47.926 --> 00:41:51.215
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can have that on the post your
checklist.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/177-4
00:41:51.215 --> 00:41:55.443
<v Josh Sparkes>So you get as much information from PE or
and they tend to be.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/178-0
00:41:55.763 --> 00:41:58.768
<v Josh Sparkes>People that request that we it's open to
anybody,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/178-1
00:41:58.768 --> 00:42:02.013
<v Josh Sparkes>so a subset of the only people that pull
the request,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/178-2
00:42:02.013 --> 00:42:06.219
<v Josh Sparkes>anyone can send you an e-mail saying
we're expecting money and trust.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/178-3
00:42:06.219 --> 00:42:09.523
<v Josh Sparkes>But the PES.
So PES are the partner executive sisters.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/179-0
00:42:11.363 --> 00:42:14.730
<v Josh Sparkes>They're the ones that are the closest to.
Yeah. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/179-1
00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:19.592
<v Josh Sparkes>Like it's either them or the partners
will know in the first instance to that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/179-2
00:42:19.592 --> 00:42:24.268
<v Josh Sparkes>the client is ending up smiling.
So that's why they're the first people to</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/179-3
00:42:24.268 --> 00:42:27.883
<v Josh Sparkes>contact us to let us know on the occasion
a lawyer might.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/180-0
00:42:28.603 --> 00:42:31.625
<v Josh Sparkes>But the PE is most often the the person
of the request,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/180-1
00:42:31.625 --> 00:42:35.457
<v Josh Sparkes>but we probably wouldn't wanna lock that
down from lawyers, et cetera,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/180-2
00:42:35.457 --> 00:42:38.695
<v Josh Sparkes>to be able to do that,
they need to be able to do that. No,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/180-3
00:42:38.695 --> 00:42:42.580
<v Josh Sparkes>I said, like anyone can let us know,
but not everyone knows that that's</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/180-4
00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:43.443
<v Josh Sparkes>happening. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/181-0
00:42:43.963 --> 00:42:47.341
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, OK, so that request form can be,
you know available,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/181-1
00:42:47.341 --> 00:42:51.963
<v Josh Sparkes>but then you will receive rather than
receiving an e-mail today that could be</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/181-2
00:42:51.963 --> 00:42:56.111
<v Josh Sparkes>populated with your checklist.
So you get that information upfront in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/181-3
00:42:56.111 --> 00:42:59.843
<v Josh Sparkes>order to, you know,
be informed that that's money's coming in.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/182-0
00:43:01.283 --> 00:43:03.710
<v Josh Sparkes>Steve,
does that have to be approved so the PDS</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/182-1
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:07.399
<v Josh Sparkes>can just do that on their own back or
does that have to be approved by a</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/182-2
00:43:07.399 --> 00:43:11.392
<v Josh Sparkes>partner say this is coming or you just
have the PE word for everything because</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/182-3
00:43:11.392 --> 00:43:14.627
<v Josh Sparkes>they're the PE partner? Yeah.
On the form that is section first</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/182-4
00:43:14.627 --> 00:43:18.317
<v Josh Sparkes>signature. So the partners like, yeah,
I'm expecting this to come in but</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/182-5
00:43:18.317 --> 00:43:18.923
<v Josh Sparkes>essentially.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/183-0
00:43:19.443 --> 00:43:23.086
<v Josh Sparkes>There's nothing for us to do until the
money actually hits our account.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/183-1
00:43:23.086 --> 00:43:27.335
<v Josh Sparkes>And you don't know that the money's going
to be coming in unless someone's told you</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/183-2
00:43:27.335 --> 00:43:30.876
<v Josh Sparkes>that the money's coming in.
It's more there's more regulations for us</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/183-3
00:43:30.876 --> 00:43:35.125
<v Josh Sparkes>to have formal approvals for the money to
be lifted out of our trust account rather</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/183-4
00:43:35.125 --> 00:43:35.883
<v Josh Sparkes>than coming in.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/184-0
00:43:36.283 --> 00:43:41.956
<v Josh Sparkes>We just need supporting documentation to
confirm where the money needs to go,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/184-1
00:43:41.956 --> 00:43:47.993
<v Josh Sparkes>where it should have been received into,
like what account it was supposed to come</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/184-2
00:43:47.993 --> 00:43:53.447
<v Josh Sparkes>into so that we can make sure that
everything is has been received against</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/184-3
00:43:53.447 --> 00:43:54.683
<v Josh Sparkes>the right client.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/185-0
00:43:55.323 --> 00:43:59.220
<v Josh Sparkes>And exactly we don't have anything that
would would ask anybody to sign off of a</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/185-1
00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.972
<v Josh Sparkes>key executives of a premium lawyer.
We just accepted from the answer to what?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/185-2
00:44:02.972 --> 00:44:05.569
<v Josh Sparkes>And it says when the money is getting
paid out again,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/185-3
00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:08.551
<v Josh Sparkes>that's when the Parliament gets involved.
And we're the same.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/185-4
00:44:08.551 --> 00:44:11.437
<v Josh Sparkes>We've we've got some sort of a question.
We've got a table.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/185-5
00:44:11.437 --> 00:44:14.323
<v Josh Sparkes>We ask people to complete with
information that we require.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/186-0
00:44:15.083 --> 00:44:18.332
<v Josh Sparkes>And they send that across to us.
We crossed once it arrives,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/186-1
00:44:18.332 --> 00:44:22.434
<v Josh Sparkes>we cross check that just been looks
correct and we simply wait for the money</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/186-2
00:44:22.434 --> 00:44:26.535
<v Josh Sparkes>to come in. We can check this. Yeah.
But we can probably uniform that. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/186-3
00:44:26.535 --> 00:44:30.476
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we'd be asking for the same type
of information probably the main</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/186-4
00:44:30.476 --> 00:44:32.820
<v Josh Sparkes>difference would just be what account
yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/186-5
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.843
<v Josh Sparkes>Because UK has got one UK has got one.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/187-0
00:44:35.403 --> 00:44:38.877
<v Josh Sparkes>Jurisdiction.
But we do have model potential different</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/187-1
00:44:38.877 --> 00:44:43.235
<v Josh Sparkes>services and so it's similar but slightly
different would they know,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/187-2
00:44:43.235 --> 00:44:48.225
<v Josh Sparkes>but is that something you decide post
receiving the receipt rather than the PE</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/187-3
00:44:48.225 --> 00:44:52.393
<v Josh Sparkes>or the the lawyer or junior lawyer
knowing that yeah, they would,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/187-4
00:44:52.393 --> 00:44:53.403
<v Josh Sparkes>they would know.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/188-0
00:44:54.083 --> 00:44:57.453
<v Josh Sparkes>After what transacted for for us,
the director transacted in pounds,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/188-1
00:44:57.453 --> 00:45:00.335
<v Josh Sparkes>EUR or U.S. dollars,
so they would know transacted in that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/188-2
00:45:00.335 --> 00:45:03.754
<v Josh Sparkes>currency. Working details to hand out.
But we we could get an e-mail.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/188-3
00:45:03.754 --> 00:45:07.759
<v Josh Sparkes>And if the money due to arrive and then
there was time we could get an e-mail and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/188-4
00:45:07.759 --> 00:45:11.617
<v Josh Sparkes>the money doesn't come for 3-4 months.
So they're just kind of over and around</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/188-5
00:45:11.617 --> 00:45:11.763
<v Josh Sparkes>or.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/189-0
00:45:12.123 --> 00:45:16.163
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know if you just get it, Anna,
but we quite often never get an e-mail at</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/189-1
00:45:16.163 --> 00:45:18.757
<v Josh Sparkes>all. Yeah,
we we don't get an e-mail or same thing.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/189-2
00:45:18.757 --> 00:45:20.952
<v Josh Sparkes>Like we'll get an e-mail. Yes.
For example,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/189-3
00:45:20.952 --> 00:45:24.842
<v Josh Sparkes>a random 260 million appeared in an
account and nobody told us anything about</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/189-4
00:45:24.842 --> 00:45:27.186
<v Josh Sparkes>this.
So we'll then scrambling about to figure</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/189-5
00:45:27.186 --> 00:45:28.283
<v Josh Sparkes>out what it's for. So.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/190-0
00:45:28.803 --> 00:45:32.259
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just going to live. Sorry. No,
just ask the question.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/190-1
00:45:32.259 --> 00:45:36.981
<v Josh Sparkes>I was going to ask about the bank account,
so your requester will know which bank</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/190-2
00:45:36.981 --> 00:45:41.416
<v Josh Sparkes>account it is to go into when they send
the request. Yeah. If it's a repeat,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/190-3
00:45:41.416 --> 00:45:46.023
<v Josh Sparkes>if it's like it's you're normally the
same client that are utilising the trust.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/190-4
00:45:46.023 --> 00:45:47.923
<v Josh Sparkes>So if they use the trust account.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/191-0
00:45:48.123 --> 00:45:50.968
<v Josh Sparkes>Months before they'll have the bank
details for us already,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/191-1
00:45:50.968 --> 00:45:54.572
<v Josh Sparkes>and you think tends to be the same,
lawyers brought them using the account,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/191-2
00:45:54.572 --> 00:45:57.701
<v Josh Sparkes>so they know what counting is.
But we do occasionally get someone</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/191-3
00:45:57.701 --> 00:46:00.830
<v Josh Sparkes>reaching out to seeing.
We've got to see what happened next week.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/191-4
00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:02.963
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you provide us with the account
details?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/192-0
00:46:03.243 --> 00:46:08.034
<v Josh Sparkes>We always prefer that they come to ask us
for account details now other than them</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/192-1
00:46:08.034 --> 00:46:12.650
<v Josh Sparkes>being readily available, because when,
like way back when when I first started</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/192-2
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:15.863
<v Josh Sparkes>over a decade ago,
account details are on Internet and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/192-3
00:46:15.863 --> 00:46:19.719
<v Josh Sparkes>people picked on account.
So we were getting client money paid in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/192-4
00:46:19.719 --> 00:46:22.523
<v Josh Sparkes>our office.
We'd say more like case of like UK.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/193-0
00:46:23.323 --> 00:46:26.731
<v Josh Sparkes>US or something like that.
You would want on the form because we</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/193-1
00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:31.029
<v Josh Sparkes>don't want to have actual bank numbers.
I'm just trying to cancel on the form for</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/193-2
00:46:31.029 --> 00:46:34.332
<v Josh Sparkes>the request there so they would
understand because we want to,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/193-3
00:46:34.332 --> 00:46:37.897
<v Josh Sparkes>if we're handling our details,
we want to make sure they've got the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/193-4
00:46:37.897 --> 00:46:41.723
<v Josh Sparkes>correct pages rather than them guessing
and selecting another one. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/194-0
00:46:42.723 --> 00:46:48.949
<v Josh Sparkes>Currency and location with you,
so the requester maybe should challenge</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/194-1
00:46:48.949 --> 00:46:56.040
<v Josh Sparkes>it so it would know on the request that
in location Australia or you know to pick</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/194-2
00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:00.363
<v Josh Sparkes>up the requesters location and then when
they're.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/195-0
00:47:01.163 --> 00:47:06.159
<v Josh Sparkes>Doing that form, they're saying, you know,
maybe your for jurisdictions or for the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/195-1
00:47:06.159 --> 00:47:08.447
<v Josh Sparkes>UK,
which currencies he's in and that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/195-2
00:47:08.447 --> 00:47:13.202
<v Josh Sparkes>naturally not saying naturally infers,
but that channels the way in which goes</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/195-3
00:47:13.202 --> 00:47:17.475
<v Josh Sparkes>in which account it will go to.
So you're picking up that information,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/195-4
00:47:17.475 --> 00:47:20.123
<v Josh Sparkes>is that the UK based on currency,
sterling?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/196-0
00:47:22.203 --> 00:47:29.098
<v Josh Sparkes>Do sometimes allow our account to be used
for offices outside of the UK would also</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/196-1
00:47:29.098 --> 00:47:35.660
<v Josh Sparkes>need to be considered if you would use an
allocation point that says automatic</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/196-2
00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:39.563
<v Josh Sparkes>selection of the combination of. Yeah,
I mean.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/197-0
00:47:39.963 --> 00:47:45.698
<v Josh Sparkes>And I was saying that it's like routing
them to the assignment group or pick it</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/197-1
00:47:45.698 --> 00:47:50.573
<v Josh Sparkes>up to do that. OK, that's this.
We've got them access to coming in.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/197-2
00:47:50.573 --> 00:47:54.443
<v Josh Sparkes>They can do that checklist comply with
that. So just.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/198-0
00:47:55.163 --> 00:48:01.186
<v Josh Sparkes>But do they know which four accounts that
they or is that something that you do?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/198-1
00:48:01.186 --> 00:48:05.350
<v Josh Sparkes>Post post. No.
The PES should know what client account,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/198-2
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:10.405
<v Josh Sparkes>what account it's coming into,
because generally it's based on what</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/198-3
00:48:10.405 --> 00:48:14.643
<v Josh Sparkes>location they're in. So OK,
a matter can only be linked.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/199-0
00:48:14.803 --> 00:48:19.084
<v Josh Sparkes>With should only be linked with a local
trust Ledger,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/199-1
00:48:19.084 --> 00:48:25.267
<v Josh Sparkes>so someone in Brisbane should only be
able to link the Brisbane Trust account</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/199-2
00:48:25.267 --> 00:48:27.883
<v Josh Sparkes>Ledger to their Nutter we've got.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/200-0
00:48:31.203 --> 00:48:36.270
<v Josh Sparkes>Got limitations in 3A to prevent a
Melbourne trust Ledger being linked to a</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/200-1
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:41.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Brisbane math based matter, but I mean OK,
you let me do have the money going to the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/200-2
00:48:41.937 --> 00:48:45.203
<v Josh Sparkes>wrong account,
but that's from the that's about.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/201-0
00:48:47.323 --> 00:48:51.127
<v Josh Sparkes>I had our control.
That's someone giving the wrong account</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/201-1
00:48:51.127 --> 00:48:55.704
<v Josh Sparkes>details. And do you get the PE?
So we've got one to one to one request</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/201-2
00:48:55.704 --> 00:48:59.830
<v Josh Sparkes>and one knowledge that these monies are
coming in. Would, Pete,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/201-3
00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:04.923
<v Josh Sparkes>you ever get situation for the PE of
saying on your e-mail that you get today?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/202-0
00:49:05.923 --> 00:49:08.714
<v Josh Sparkes>Multiple. You know,
this is expected On this date.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/202-1
00:49:08.714 --> 00:49:12.600
<v Josh Sparkes>There's another one of another,
or is it very much one to one requests</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/202-2
00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.008
<v Josh Sparkes>that you get?
I'm just thinking about that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/202-3
00:49:15.008 --> 00:49:19.495
<v Josh Sparkes>They can do one request form for multiple
informations that they're giving you in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/202-4
00:49:19.495 --> 00:49:22.231
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia.
It's more common that we would receive</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/202-5
00:49:22.231 --> 00:49:24.803
<v Josh Sparkes>multiple deposits on the same day rather
than.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/203-0
00:49:25.603 --> 00:49:30.254
<v Josh Sparkes>Multiple deposits going across multi days
that makes sense. Sorry.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/203-1
00:49:30.254 --> 00:49:35.113
<v Josh Sparkes>Similar to Martin's example,
before using property settlement we have</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/203-2
00:49:35.113 --> 00:49:38.306
<v Josh Sparkes>an offer,
a couple of officers that do manage</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/203-3
00:49:38.306 --> 00:49:39.763
<v Josh Sparkes>number of properties.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/204-0
00:49:40.043 --> 00:49:45.402
<v Josh Sparkes>So you might see 12 deposits of the same
amount of money coming in on the same day,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/204-1
00:49:45.402 --> 00:49:50.441
<v Josh Sparkes>but it might be relative to across a
couple of different matters based on what</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/204-2
00:49:50.441 --> 00:49:53.950
<v Josh Sparkes>the properties are.
So that's more likely to happen in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/204-3
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:57.714
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia, right?
So even though they've been deposited on</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/204-4
00:49:57.714 --> 00:49:59.563
<v Josh Sparkes>the same, you might have had.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/205-0
00:49:59.643 --> 00:50:05.104
<v Josh Sparkes>Multiple requests that's informing you
that they were coming in. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/205-1
00:50:05.104 --> 00:50:09.927
<v Josh Sparkes>So the e-mail would have.
I've got 12 deposit amounts of $1000 each</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/205-2
00:50:09.927 --> 00:50:14.323
<v Josh Sparkes>coming in isn't that matters,
but I've got they have to have.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/206-0
00:50:14.883 --> 00:50:19.469
<v Josh Sparkes>In separate form for each deposit.
So there'd be 12 attachments on that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/206-1
00:50:19.469 --> 00:50:22.844
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail for me.
Who can handle that multiple? I mean,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/206-2
00:50:22.844 --> 00:50:25.773
<v Josh Sparkes>Mark,
we've talked about before that it would</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/206-3
00:50:25.773 --> 00:50:30.168
<v Josh Sparkes>allow the requester user answer like
almost like multiple yeah rows.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/206-4
00:50:30.168 --> 00:50:34.243
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean if they're the same thing,
maybe if they're 12 deposits.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/207-0
00:50:34.283 --> 00:50:37.293
<v Josh Sparkes>And then it can be because they're
they're.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/207-1
00:50:37.293 --> 00:50:40.917
<v Josh Sparkes>But I have specific property references
on it. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/207-2
00:50:40.917 --> 00:50:46.457
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's why we need the 12 the the 12
forms to specify which deposit and which</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/207-3
00:50:46.457 --> 00:50:51.450
<v Josh Sparkes>property goes with which matter.
If it goes across a couple of different</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/207-4
00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:53.843
<v Josh Sparkes>matters. And that's something that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/209-0
00:50:53.883 --> 00:50:58.071
<v Josh Sparkes>That comes up in our audit that we have
to have that paperwork provided for every</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/209-1
00:50:58.071 --> 00:51:01.442
<v Josh Sparkes>single trust receipt. Yeah.
So that's about the watering evidence</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/209-2
00:51:01.442 --> 00:51:04.762
<v Josh Sparkes>that we talked about.
But there is that one to one relationship.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/209-3
00:51:04.762 --> 00:51:05.323
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/210-0
00:51:08.483 --> 00:51:12.060
<v Josh Sparkes>Generally we will get requests per matter,
so we'll get one e-mail saying we're</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/210-1
00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:15.636
<v Josh Sparkes>expecting money in for this matter and
this only comes as one payment or it may</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/210-2
00:51:15.636 --> 00:51:18.542
<v Josh Sparkes>come as five separate payments,
but it's one request per matter.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/210-3
00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:20.778
<v Josh Sparkes>Generally,
rather than you're getting 12 and then</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/210-4
00:51:20.778 --> 00:51:23.683
<v Josh Sparkes>one go for different matters do do you
ever get multiple though?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/211-0
00:51:25.283 --> 00:51:28.501
<v Josh Sparkes>Very, very, very rarely. You know,
maybe if someone you know, I'm going.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/211-1
00:51:28.501 --> 00:51:30.837
<v Josh Sparkes>It's too.
Lots of money in June for these two miles.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/211-2
00:51:30.837 --> 00:51:34.451
<v Josh Sparkes>And I've just put it in one e-mail and I
think it's just because of requested two</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/211-3
00:51:34.451 --> 00:51:36.964
<v Josh Sparkes>different clients to pay.
Probably prior to that e-mail.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/211-4
00:51:36.964 --> 00:51:39.123
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just to save time,
but very rarely happens.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/212-0
00:51:40.603 --> 00:51:44.970
<v Josh Sparkes>The requested one.
We can handle that can handle them. Yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/212-1
00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:48.262
<v Josh Sparkes>it's probably that if we have that
checklist,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/212-2
00:51:48.262 --> 00:51:53.416
<v Josh Sparkes>the moment you've got the form that they
complete and will be attached,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/212-3
00:51:53.416 --> 00:51:55.563
<v Josh Sparkes>it's that checklist. And then.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/213-0
00:51:56.083 --> 00:52:00.229
<v Josh Sparkes>As we're just saying, Chris,
that it's that inferred approval that's</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/213-1
00:52:00.229 --> 00:52:04.854
<v Josh Sparkes>come from the partner or somebody,
so would a checklist be enough supporting</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/213-2
00:52:04.854 --> 00:52:09.360
<v Josh Sparkes>evidence that's been replacing the the
form that you have the checklist be</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/213-3
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.243
<v Josh Sparkes>sufficient that they've included the
following?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/214-0
00:52:12.523 --> 00:52:15.594
<v Josh Sparkes>I think so,
as long as there's we've got the all of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/214-1
00:52:15.594 --> 00:52:19.431
<v Josh Sparkes>the tracks. Yeah. As I said,
we just need to we at the moment we</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/214-2
00:52:19.431 --> 00:52:24.037
<v Josh Sparkes>essentially that 3 way check of matching
the information on the form with the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/214-3
00:52:24.037 --> 00:52:26.634
<v Josh Sparkes>information,
the e-mail is the same and the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/214-4
00:52:26.634 --> 00:52:31.003
<v Josh Sparkes>information that turns up on our bank
statement that the right person is.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/215-0
00:52:31.323 --> 00:52:35.188
<v Josh Sparkes>Paying us into the right account and
using the same references and we're</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/215-1
00:52:35.188 --> 00:52:39.105
<v Josh Sparkes>putting it on the right matter.
So that's generally why we have that form</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/215-2
00:52:39.105 --> 00:52:42.016
<v Josh Sparkes>in that e-mail,
make sure that we're allocating it the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/215-3
00:52:42.016 --> 00:52:45.563
<v Josh Sparkes>right in the right place.
So if we have the checklist that has the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/215-4
00:52:45.563 --> 00:52:49.003
<v Josh Sparkes>same type of information that we need,
that would be fine. Cool.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/216-0
00:52:50.163 --> 00:52:53.716
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm back to and then I'm sort of jumping
a little bit ahead,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/216-1
00:52:53.716 --> 00:52:57.327
<v Josh Sparkes>but just dealing with the requester.
Do you then inform them?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/216-2
00:52:57.327 --> 00:53:01.811
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you need to pay back anything to
because they told you that to expect the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/216-3
00:53:01.811 --> 00:53:04.665
<v Josh Sparkes>money?
Is there a sort of remittance or anything</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/216-4
00:53:04.665 --> 00:53:09.323
<v Josh Sparkes>you have to notify back to the PE or the
requester the money has been received?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/217-0
00:53:09.843 --> 00:53:13.038
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, as well. Yeah. OK.
So when the money comes in,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/217-1
00:53:13.038 --> 00:53:16.342
<v Josh Sparkes>there is a once the money has been
received onto the matter,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/217-2
00:53:16.342 --> 00:53:20.349
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a trust receipt PDF that's
generated and we send that back to say</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/217-3
00:53:20.349 --> 00:53:23.652
<v Josh Sparkes>it's been receipted.
This is how much it was on this matter.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/217-4
00:53:23.652 --> 00:53:27.984
<v Josh Sparkes>So that that's our confirmation to say
that we've put it in the right place and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/217-5
00:53:27.984 --> 00:53:29.283
<v Josh Sparkes>you should be seeing it.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/218-0
00:53:31.203 --> 00:53:33.929
<v Josh Sparkes>We simply just tell them that when he's
arrived,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/218-1
00:53:33.929 --> 00:53:36.655
<v Josh Sparkes>we don't do that and it's just the script
there.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/218-2
00:53:36.655 --> 00:53:39.436
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just going to explain how they need
to see,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/218-3
00:53:39.436 --> 00:53:42.217
<v Josh Sparkes>do they need to see that remittance or
that idea.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/218-4
00:53:42.217 --> 00:53:46.500
<v Josh Sparkes>I just think is a notification sufficient
P the P is requested from a client</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/218-5
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:49.003
<v Josh Sparkes>perspective because clients might be
asking.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/219-0
00:53:49.203 --> 00:53:57.123
<v Josh Sparkes>To have a receipt or confirmation that
we've received it and oh OK.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/220-0
00:54:07.003 --> 00:54:10.171
<v Josh Sparkes>Everyone,
everyone in the pools wondering what's</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/220-1
00:54:10.171 --> 00:54:13.209
<v Josh Sparkes>going on.
I mean the the receipt PDFs are auto</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/220-2
00:54:13.209 --> 00:54:18.251
<v Josh Sparkes>generated from three a so that generally
just gets pulled out of 3A and sent.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/220-3
00:54:18.251 --> 00:54:23.163
<v Josh Sparkes>I can't remember if it's either sent
directly from three or sent an e-mail.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/221-0
00:54:23.483 --> 00:54:27.402
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably could be done both ways.
That must be a jurisdiction from them,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/221-1
00:54:27.402 --> 00:54:30.783
<v Josh Sparkes>because that that doesn't happen here. OK,
I don't think it's.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/221-2
00:54:30.783 --> 00:54:35.239
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not a requirement. It's nice to have.
It's something that generally peers and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/221-3
00:54:35.239 --> 00:54:38.083
<v Josh Sparkes>clients are asking us for. Yeah.
So also there's no.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/222-0
00:54:39.283 --> 00:54:44.046
<v Josh Sparkes>So once that is done,
you're saying 3E generates that PDF and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/222-1
00:54:44.046 --> 00:54:46.043
<v Josh Sparkes>notifies? That's probably.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/223-0
00:54:48.163 --> 00:54:53.298
<v Josh Sparkes>That mechanism we can use it then notify.
I mean it could be that as you go through</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/223-1
00:54:53.298 --> 00:54:53.603
<v Josh Sparkes>this.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/224-0
00:54:56.443 --> 00:55:00.549
<v Josh Sparkes>Amounts going off today as we go through
that process of that,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/224-1
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:04.134
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got the requests,
you know when he's coming in,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/224-2
00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:08.956
<v Josh Sparkes>so it then gets assigned to your
appropriate routes in Australia with the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/224-3
00:55:08.956 --> 00:55:11.758
<v Josh Sparkes>UK.
What other once you've received it and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/224-4
00:55:11.758 --> 00:55:15.603
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got that request in your queue in
service now what?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/225-0
00:55:15.723 --> 00:55:18.860
<v Josh Sparkes>Information.
Then you need to check against that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/225-1
00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:23.878
<v Josh Sparkes>Or is it? Is it just information only?
We're now waiting it to have to check in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/225-2
00:55:23.878 --> 00:55:28.207
<v Josh Sparkes>the bank cheque that the bank is active
or so when we get a request,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/225-3
00:55:28.207 --> 00:55:31.030
<v Josh Sparkes>we will make sure that the matter is
active.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/225-4
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:35.483
<v Josh Sparkes>And quite often matters can be kind of
partially open so that lawyers.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/226-0
00:55:35.603 --> 00:55:39.677
<v Josh Sparkes>They start recording time,
but they're not fully open yet because</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/226-1
00:55:39.677 --> 00:55:44.121
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not going to fill the compliance
cheques and and they should not be</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/226-2
00:55:44.121 --> 00:55:48.935
<v Josh Sparkes>getting any money into an account until
such time that it marks fully opened.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/226-3
00:55:48.935 --> 00:55:51.403
<v Josh Sparkes>But and that's. Is that right? Yeah. So.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/227-0
00:55:51.963 --> 00:55:54.626
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
that's one thing we can look at that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/227-1
00:55:54.626 --> 00:55:59.477
<v Josh Sparkes>other than the manual check later on that
there's a matter associated integration</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/227-2
00:55:59.477 --> 00:56:02.908
<v Josh Sparkes>to service now.
But it'd be amazing if they could put in.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/227-3
00:56:02.908 --> 00:56:06.636
<v Josh Sparkes>This is a matter number.
The money relates to and then service</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/227-4
00:56:06.636 --> 00:56:10.659
<v Josh Sparkes>payer works at freeing says actually this
matter is not opened yet.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/227-5
00:56:10.659 --> 00:56:11.723
<v Josh Sparkes>So don't get that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/228-0
00:56:11.803 --> 00:56:15.997
<v Josh Sparkes>That sorted before you ask for any money
to come in integration. Yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/228-1
00:56:15.997 --> 00:56:19.068
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a check with from the East.
I'm just thinking,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/228-2
00:56:19.068 --> 00:56:23.202
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't want this behaviour change,
but also check this step with the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/228-3
00:56:23.202 --> 00:56:26.568
<v Josh Sparkes>passwords. Yeah,
we will take the use case away with the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/228-4
00:56:26.568 --> 00:56:30.643
<v Josh Sparkes>discretion. That's pop. Not. Yeah,
the whole session of integration.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/229-0
00:56:31.483 --> 00:56:37.860
<v Josh Sparkes>In the way about the changes also. Yeah.
So the reason if you take the matter and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/229-1
00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:42.682
<v Josh Sparkes>it just says no, yes,
kind of it could be the as you said the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/229-2
00:56:42.682 --> 00:56:48.203
<v Josh Sparkes>part of that checklist, the PE cheques,
the matter is active for your.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/230-0
00:56:49.083 --> 00:56:52.819
<v Josh Sparkes>And the team that's already been pre
checked and even if you're just marking</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/230-1
00:56:52.819 --> 00:56:55.002
<v Josh Sparkes>that bit of homework that it's been
checked,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/230-2
00:56:55.002 --> 00:56:59.029
<v Josh Sparkes>I I'm making excuses for these guys here,
but I don't think they'll check properly</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/230-3
00:56:59.029 --> 00:57:02.667
<v Josh Sparkes>because every time we go back to them
saying we've received money for this</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/230-4
00:57:02.667 --> 00:57:06.451
<v Josh Sparkes>matter and it's not opened yet, they go,
we get an e-mail two months ago from</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/230-5
00:57:06.451 --> 00:57:08.003
<v Josh Sparkes>compliance to say it was opened.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/231-0
00:57:08.403 --> 00:57:12.576
<v Josh Sparkes>So now you get an e-mail from compliance
to say it's open for time recordings,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/231-1
00:57:12.576 --> 00:57:16.168
<v Josh Sparkes>so I don't think they would physically go
into the system to check.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/231-2
00:57:16.168 --> 00:57:20.394
<v Josh Sparkes>I think they would rely on what defence
in our head already for whatever it is,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/231-3
00:57:20.394 --> 00:57:23.563
<v Josh Sparkes>that's what we change the capture that,
that they check it.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/232-0
00:57:24.203 --> 00:57:27.000
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I think if we can build it into their</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/232-1
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.321
<v Josh Sparkes>processes and it's it would catalyst to
try and create some change,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/232-2
00:57:31.321 --> 00:57:35.324
<v Josh Sparkes>it will be very, I agree,
but definitely difficult to get that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/232-3
00:57:35.324 --> 00:57:39.645
<v Josh Sparkes>across in Australia as well.
But I think it would be beneficial for</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/232-4
00:57:39.645 --> 00:57:42.123
<v Josh Sparkes>both chains to save us some time. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/233-0
00:57:43.723 --> 00:57:47.438
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry, sorry. As we go through today,
it's worthwhile and things like that,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/233-1
00:57:47.438 --> 00:57:51.152
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe that's the kind of stuff to join
and capture from a change management</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/233-2
00:57:51.152 --> 00:57:54.965
<v Josh Sparkes>perspective and then we'll work with
stakeholders or certain groups of people</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/233-3
00:57:54.965 --> 00:57:58.777
<v Josh Sparkes>around what changes or state changes they
may need doing their own processing</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/233-4
00:57:58.777 --> 00:57:59.363
<v Josh Sparkes>etcetera so.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/234-0
00:58:00.323 --> 00:58:04.079
<v Josh Sparkes>I have to work that for you, joy with us,
as you said,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/234-1
00:58:04.079 --> 00:58:08.244
<v Josh Sparkes>and it could be leading you know,
is it different from time,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/234-2
00:58:08.244 --> 00:58:13.161
<v Josh Sparkes>you know as well you can always leave
them that they check with it. OK,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/234-3
00:58:13.161 --> 00:58:16.643
<v Josh Sparkes>it's active. It's open.
But it's for this purpose.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/235-0
00:58:17.083 --> 00:58:20.008
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes,
you're leading the means that it might be</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/235-1
00:58:20.008 --> 00:58:22.870
<v Josh Sparkes>looking.
It's a double double check that it's</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/235-2
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:26.666
<v Josh Sparkes>differentiating it.
It might be that we can specify that the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/235-3
00:58:26.666 --> 00:58:29.590
<v Josh Sparkes>status must be active. Yeah,
I can't remember.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/235-4
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:34.443
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like because I think pending QA is
probably the most common status that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/236-0
00:58:35.763 --> 00:58:40.939
<v Josh Sparkes>The matters have where lawyers can record
their time, but we can't.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/236-1
00:58:40.939 --> 00:58:44.973
<v Josh Sparkes>We still can't accept the cheques,
the trust monies.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/236-2
00:58:44.973 --> 00:58:49.843
<v Josh Sparkes>So I give you some state. Yeah,
I think that's where. Or Karen?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/237-0
00:58:51.123 --> 00:58:53.525
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
we can we can build that like almost like</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/237-1
00:58:53.525 --> 00:58:56.070
<v Josh Sparkes>a a question to yes,
I think it's a leading but yes,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/237-2
00:58:56.070 --> 00:58:59.864
<v Josh Sparkes>but in the future it would be that's
going to go actually for the free you can</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/237-3
00:58:59.864 --> 00:59:03.753
<v Josh Sparkes>do that scan and go actually get to see
all the different accounts and bills and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/237-4
00:59:03.753 --> 00:59:07.355
<v Josh Sparkes>what kind of accounts and go yeah,
because it's actually now you can raise</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/237-5
00:59:07.355 --> 00:59:08.123
<v Josh Sparkes>the request but.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/238-0
00:59:09.163 --> 00:59:14.082
<v Josh Sparkes>But you can't set that one. And what?
Yeah, that's possible. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/238-1
00:59:14.082 --> 00:59:19.221
<v Josh Sparkes>that Lady question would be,
I suppose we have been some screenshots.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/238-2
00:59:19.221 --> 00:59:24.653
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, so saying that, for example,
even the checklist that leaving question</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/238-3
00:59:24.653 --> 00:59:27.883
<v Josh Sparkes>and double checked, etcetera.
That's great.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/239-0
00:59:28.003 --> 00:59:31.903
<v Josh Sparkes>So you have that that could be up on your
flight. Yes, you know,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/239-1
00:59:31.903 --> 00:59:35.863
<v Josh Sparkes>and then what other texts do you have to
do? So you, as you said,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/239-2
00:59:35.863 --> 00:59:39.163
<v Josh Sparkes>you might mark their homework,
that they've done that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/239-3
00:59:39.163 --> 00:59:42.823
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've double checked that. Yes.
What we said is correct.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/239-4
00:59:42.823 --> 00:59:47.443
<v Josh Sparkes>Rid of confidence that they're doing it
correctly. And then what additional?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/240-0
00:59:47.523 --> 00:59:52.482
<v Josh Sparkes>Motion to you. Add to that, do you?
We I feel all the information of provided</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/240-1
00:59:52.482 --> 00:59:55.852
<v Josh Sparkes>looks fine.
We would just kind of leave that request</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/240-2
00:59:55.852 --> 01:00:00.747
<v Josh Sparkes>pending until such time that the money
comes in money comes in and all still</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/240-3
01:00:00.747 --> 01:00:04.243
<v Josh Sparkes>matches up we would let them that the
money is in and.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/241-0
01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:08.780
<v Josh Sparkes>That's that's that. Basically,
the money would sit there until such</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/241-1
01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:13.830
<v Josh Sparkes>times that it needs to be used and paid
back out again, and that could be seconds,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/241-2
01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:17.419
<v Josh Sparkes>so it could be years.
Just depends on the specific matter.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/241-3
01:00:17.419 --> 01:00:20.643
<v Josh Sparkes>But as part of money coming into our
client account.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/242-0
01:00:22.123 --> 01:00:26.623
<v Josh Sparkes>We do have the option to open up an
interest account for the clients so that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/242-1
01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:31.474
<v Josh Sparkes>the money earns interest on their behalf,
came while it's waiting to get paid out,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/242-2
01:00:31.474 --> 01:00:36.266
<v Josh Sparkes>but that's on a matter by matter basis.
It's not for every single matter we leave</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/242-3
01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:39.363
<v Josh Sparkes>that decision up to the fear and as if
they want to.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/243-0
01:00:39.963 --> 01:00:42.957
<v Josh Sparkes>Accrued interest or not,
that's what the control money. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/243-1
01:00:42.957 --> 01:00:46.674
<v Josh Sparkes>So the P doesn't look like that is
something you would do. That's something.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/243-2
01:00:46.674 --> 01:00:50.005
<v Josh Sparkes>That's something we would do.
So it's one of the questions we ask on</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/243-3
01:00:50.005 --> 01:00:52.129
<v Josh Sparkes>the table.
Would you like to earn interest?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/243-4
01:00:52.129 --> 01:00:55.074
<v Josh Sparkes>And if they say yes,
we would separately go away and open up</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/243-5
01:00:55.074 --> 01:00:58.163
<v Josh Sparkes>that account without any more involvement
for them. And do you?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/245-0
01:00:58.803 --> 01:01:04.814
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that our problem on the these requests
that are coming in basis or is that our</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/245-1
01:01:04.814 --> 01:01:09.286
<v Josh Sparkes>upfront when they're setting up these
accounts in Australia,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/245-2
01:01:09.286 --> 01:01:13.391
<v Josh Sparkes>it's generally for us,
it's generally the same partner.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/245-3
01:01:13.391 --> 01:01:15.443
<v Josh Sparkes>So for our we would not ask.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/246-0
01:01:16.043 --> 01:01:19.648
<v Josh Sparkes>A lot of clients,
whether they want their money in a</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/246-1
01:01:19.648 --> 01:01:25.158
<v Josh Sparkes>controlled money account and that there's
a bank key for partners that generally</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/246-2
01:01:25.158 --> 01:01:30.055
<v Josh Sparkes>would because they it's to do with
property settlements and purchase of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/246-3
01:01:30.055 --> 01:01:30.803
<v Josh Sparkes>properties.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/247-0
01:01:31.163 --> 01:01:35.041
<v Josh Sparkes>So the clients want their money to earn
interest while they're waiting for the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/247-1
01:01:35.041 --> 01:01:38.378
<v Josh Sparkes>settlement to go through.
That could be anywhere between six months</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/247-2
01:01:38.378 --> 01:01:41.667
<v Josh Sparkes>to 10 years kind of thing.
We've had money sitting in a controlled</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/247-3
01:01:41.667 --> 01:01:45.544
<v Josh Sparkes>money account for eight years at the
moment just earning interest and you have</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/247-4
01:01:45.544 --> 01:01:47.163
<v Josh Sparkes>multiple deposits into that, but.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/248-0
01:01:48.043 --> 01:01:50.610
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia leaves that up to the partner
to decide.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/248-1
01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:53.277
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't do any leading questions about
it. That is,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/248-2
01:01:53.277 --> 01:01:56.447
<v Josh Sparkes>we do have on our table how much you
expect and who's it from.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/248-3
01:01:56.447 --> 01:02:00.423
<v Josh Sparkes>What matter is it related to and would
you like to an interest if they say no,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/248-4
01:02:00.423 --> 01:02:04.398
<v Josh Sparkes>we do nothing further. If they say yes,
we open up a specific interest account</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/248-5
01:02:04.398 --> 01:02:05.203
<v Josh Sparkes>for that client.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/249-0
01:02:08.363 --> 01:02:12.375
<v Josh Sparkes>But that wouldn't be back on the back of
receiving these requests.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/249-1
01:02:12.375 --> 01:02:15.908
<v Josh Sparkes>That is the fact that an interest account
has been opened.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/249-2
01:02:15.908 --> 01:02:19.620
<v Josh Sparkes>So when the money goes in,
it goes into a particular interest</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/249-3
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:22.674
<v Josh Sparkes>account.
So we we've got all money comes into like</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/249-4
01:02:22.674 --> 01:02:26.207
<v Josh Sparkes>the main trust account.
But if we have to open an interest</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/249-5
01:02:26.207 --> 01:02:27.763
<v Josh Sparkes>account, we syphon it out.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/250-0
01:02:27.923 --> 01:02:31.645
<v Josh Sparkes>Of the trust account and keep it and that
interest account so we can have any</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/250-1
01:02:31.645 --> 01:02:35.606
<v Josh Sparkes>number of interest accounts on any given
day because the open and close on a daily</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/250-2
01:02:35.606 --> 01:02:37.896
<v Josh Sparkes>basis.
But then that when the money is ready to</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/250-3
01:02:37.896 --> 01:02:40.234
<v Josh Sparkes>be paid out,
we move it back out of the interest</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/250-4
01:02:40.234 --> 01:02:44.003
<v Josh Sparkes>account into a main client account and
then it gets transacted out from there.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/251-0
01:02:44.563 --> 01:02:47.876
<v Josh Sparkes>So if we take that new head coming in,
affecting money,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/251-1
01:02:47.876 --> 01:02:50.596
<v Josh Sparkes>if you'd have new work in progress,
you know,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/251-2
01:02:50.596 --> 01:02:54.795
<v Josh Sparkes>because you might do for check that check
that lead Matthew is active,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/251-3
01:02:54.795 --> 01:02:59.054
<v Josh Sparkes>that could be an audit trail.
And then would you then enter any further</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/251-4
01:02:59.054 --> 01:02:59.763
<v Josh Sparkes>information?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/252-0
01:03:00.563 --> 01:03:05.019
<v Josh Sparkes>When you're going to close, complete it,
but before it will be money.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/252-1
01:03:05.019 --> 01:03:09.793
<v Josh Sparkes>Money added to this account, you know,
confirm which account it's gone to,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/252-2
01:03:09.793 --> 01:03:13.039
<v Josh Sparkes>and then close this request once somebody
arrives.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/252-3
01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:17.812
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just a case of alert to them.
It's arrived and in the closing request</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/252-4
01:03:17.812 --> 01:03:19.403
<v Josh Sparkes>of so, no more gathering.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/254-0
01:03:19.723 --> 01:03:24.178
<v Josh Sparkes>For enrichment that you add on to that
request or we'd like to add on to that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/254-1
01:03:24.178 --> 01:03:27.661
<v Josh Sparkes>request. For example, they're expecting,
let's just say 100,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/254-2
01:03:27.661 --> 01:03:31.716
<v Josh Sparkes>000 coming in for this matter, 10,
000 coming in and then before close</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/254-3
01:03:31.716 --> 01:03:35.885
<v Josh Sparkes>complete you you've seen, let's received,
but actually it was only 5000,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/254-4
01:03:35.885 --> 01:03:37.483
<v Josh Sparkes>it wasn't the right amounts.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/255-0
01:03:38.003 --> 01:03:41.142
<v Josh Sparkes>Would that happen? Yeah, that can happen.
But on those occasions,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/255-1
01:03:41.142 --> 01:03:44.947
<v Josh Sparkes>we'd go back and see what you've received.
Half the money is something changed.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/255-2
01:03:44.947 --> 01:03:48.513
<v Josh Sparkes>Are you expecting more money to arrive?
If they say actually something has</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/255-3
01:03:48.513 --> 01:03:51.937
<v Josh Sparkes>changed and that's all we're receiving,
we're to close the request off.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/255-4
01:03:51.937 --> 01:03:55.123
<v Josh Sparkes>But if they come back and said that,
we'd expect a second payment.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/256-0
01:03:55.483 --> 01:04:00.040
<v Josh Sparkes>We would keep it opened until such time,
so I'm just thinking about a case where</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/256-1
01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.640
<v Josh Sparkes>you're saying, you know,
in that bit between waiting for it and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/256-2
01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.565
<v Josh Sparkes>closing it.
You've got that workflow and ServiceNow</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/256-3
01:04:06.565 --> 01:04:11.178
<v Josh Sparkes>that can say confirmed monies equals the
request or close complete money disputed</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/256-4
01:04:11.178 --> 01:04:15.003
<v Josh Sparkes>from the amount received and then maybe
there's a record that says.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/257-0
01:04:15.403 --> 01:04:19.877
<v Josh Sparkes>Yet change in circumstances changing,
you know, that's still closed, confirms,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/257-1
01:04:19.877 --> 01:04:24.011
<v Josh Sparkes>but you've got some capturing details of,
you know, over time. Actually,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/257-2
01:04:24.011 --> 01:04:27.749
<v Josh Sparkes>we had 10 requests and eight of them
matched the money and eight,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/257-3
01:04:27.749 --> 01:04:30.523
<v Josh Sparkes>two of them didn't.
But you've got a supporting.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/258-0
01:04:31.283 --> 01:04:35.001
<v Josh Sparkes>Audit trial for that. You know,
that's something we can enhance in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/258-1
01:04:35.001 --> 01:04:39.329
<v Josh Sparkes>service. Now that you know you wouldn't,
you could just. There's a, you know,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/258-2
01:04:39.329 --> 01:04:43.767
<v Josh Sparkes>a box that's populated with the amount
that's copied from the effective request</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/258-3
01:04:43.767 --> 01:04:47.540
<v Josh Sparkes>but can be altered and reconciled based
on the money that comes in.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/258-4
01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:50.203
<v Josh Sparkes>And then it's closed. Eileen, sorry,
you go on.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/259-0
01:04:50.403 --> 01:04:54.288
<v Josh Sparkes>Because in these tables,
if we do build out a form into service,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/259-1
01:04:54.288 --> 01:04:59.128
<v Josh Sparkes>now we like take a a print out of that
until like APDF form because we for every</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/259-2
01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:03.490
<v Josh Sparkes>transaction we post them to fee,
we always like to put that back up into</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/259-3
01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:06.956
<v Josh Sparkes>the fee system.
That's supposing everything supposing and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/259-4
01:05:06.956 --> 01:05:10.123
<v Josh Sparkes>that sells for an audit and stuff like
that as well.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/260-0
01:05:10.243 --> 01:05:13.563
<v Josh Sparkes>So Mark, did you capture that question?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/261-0
01:05:14.363 --> 01:05:18.354
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, it's a call.
Most records you can just right click and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/261-1
01:05:18.354 --> 01:05:21.559
<v Mark Sedge>take APDF.
Your version of it and then then load</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/261-2
01:05:21.559 --> 01:05:24.896
<v Mark Sedge>that in.
We can we obviously we can check in terms</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/261-3
01:05:24.896 --> 01:05:30.325
<v Mark Sedge>of the structure of it because sometimes
it can be depending on what you're you're</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/261-4
01:05:30.325 --> 01:05:33.923
<v Mark Sedge>extracting and lifting.
It can be sort of fairly long.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/263-0
01:05:34.003 --> 01:05:37.039
<v Mark Sedge>Winded because you'll get all the work
notes and things like that,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/263-1
01:05:37.039 --> 01:05:39.938
<v Mark Sedge>but if you're happy with that full
content as your audit trail,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/263-2
01:05:39.938 --> 01:05:41.523
<v Mark Sedge>I don't think that'll be a problem.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/264-0
01:05:42.363 --> 01:05:48.192
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Because specifically for the UK,
when our auditors come in and they will</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/264-1
01:05:48.192 --> 01:05:53.872
<v Josh Sparkes>want to see copies of these tables,
so it needs to be an A readable format I</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/265-0
01:05:53.523 --> 01:05:56.662
<v Mark Sedge>So, so,
so one of the things we do need to make</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/264-2
01:05:53.872 --> 01:05:54.683
<v Josh Sparkes>don't want.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/265-1
01:05:56.662 --> 01:06:01.369
<v Mark Sedge>sure is that we have, you know,
all of the right fields and things like</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/265-2
01:06:01.369 --> 01:06:06.469
<v Mark Sedge>that with the right data in such in that
primary record that you want to use.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/265-3
01:06:06.469 --> 01:06:11.045
<v Mark Sedge>So that when you do drop it in,
it's got all the content that that is</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/265-4
01:06:11.045 --> 01:06:12.483
<v Mark Sedge>required for evidence.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/266-0
01:06:12.563 --> 01:06:12.683
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/267-0
01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:16.317
<v Josh Sparkes>And Mark,
if we were able to print out APDF,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/267-1
01:06:16.317 --> 01:06:20.901
<v Josh Sparkes>would that also then be time stamped?
Because I know a lot of the workflows</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/267-2
01:06:20.901 --> 01:06:25.183
<v Josh Sparkes>that go through ServiceNow are going to
be time stamped in ServiceNow.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/267-3
01:06:25.183 --> 01:06:29.283
<v Josh Sparkes>But would the PDF also be time stamped or
could it be time stamped?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/271-0
01:06:29.723 --> 01:06:35.153
<v Mark Sedge>I think the only thing you get with PDF
is the is the date of which it was</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/268-0
01:06:30.163 --> 01:06:30.563
<v Josh Sparkes>And.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/269-0
01:06:32.323 --> 01:06:32.523
<v Josh Sparkes>2nd.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/270-0
01:06:34.443 --> 01:06:34.563
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/271-1
01:06:35.153 --> 01:06:36.963
<v Mark Sedge>created from that record.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/273-0
01:06:38.243 --> 01:06:43.168
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, so it wouldn't have like the,
sorry when you said date created,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/272-0
01:06:41.603 --> 01:06:42.963
<v Mark Sedge>Parrot might be packed.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/273-1
01:06:43.168 --> 01:06:48.890
<v Josh Sparkes>do you mean the date created the the PDF
is created or the date the request in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/273-2
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:50.483
<v Josh Sparkes>ServiceNow is created.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/274-0
01:06:51.483 --> 01:06:53.840
<v Mark Sedge>I'll let Parrick answer that when he's
got his hand up,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/274-1
01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.523
<v Mark Sedge>he'll have more insight on that than me.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/275-0
01:06:56.723 --> 01:06:57.523
<v Mark Sedge>Go ahead parikh.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/276-0
01:06:57.643 --> 01:07:00.288
<v Parik Narain>Hi, mark. Thanks mark.
So in terms of the time stamps,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/276-1
01:07:00.288 --> 01:07:03.654
<v Parik Narain>obviously the PDF itself will be will
have the created date etcetera.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/276-2
01:07:03.654 --> 01:07:07.405
<v Parik Narain>The metadata for that date when you
created that date when you when you build</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/276-3
01:07:07.405 --> 01:07:09.713
<v Parik Narain>that PDF,
the data integrated in the in the PDF</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/276-4
01:07:09.713 --> 01:07:12.022
<v Parik Narain>itself,
it's going to be all your audit trails.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/276-5
01:07:12.022 --> 01:07:15.243
<v Parik Narain>So that's going to be time stamped in
individually for each entry.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/278-0
01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:19.443
<v Parik Narain>So you can use both to evidence the
request.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/277-0
01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:18.323
<v Josh Sparkes>So.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/280-0
01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:25.443
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll get a got a note to get a version
of what that looks like for you to have a</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/280-1
01:07:25.443 --> 01:07:28.803
<v Josh Sparkes>look. Yeah. Think I was thinking of it.
Can we all add into the?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/279-0
01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:29.163
<v Parik Narain>Yeah. The other,
the other thing we have seen.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/281-0
01:07:31.083 --> 01:07:34.503
<v Parik Narain>So I just to add one more.
The other bit we have seen for especially</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/281-1
01:07:34.503 --> 01:07:38.170
<v Parik Narain>for auditors who are coming in frequently
is special dashboards for them.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/281-2
01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:41.985
<v Parik Narain>So we're going to look at creating
dashboards from the details of the cases,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/281-3
01:07:41.985 --> 01:07:44.711
<v Parik Narain>slash matters you've done and put them on
a dashboard.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/281-4
01:07:44.711 --> 01:07:46.643
<v Parik Narain>So you can show them when they're here.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/283-0
01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:50.083
<v Parik Narain>To evidence.
So that's much more ideal time and much</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/282-0
01:07:48.803 --> 01:07:49.203
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/283-1
01:07:50.083 --> 01:07:50.363
<v Parik Narain>easier.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/284-0
01:07:51.283 --> 01:07:55.585
<v Josh Sparkes>That wouldn't work for the UK auditors if
other auditors have got their own portal</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/284-1
01:07:55.585 --> 01:07:59.887
<v Josh Sparkes>that we have to upload details into their
portal so and they keep that captured as</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/286-0
01:07:59.323 --> 01:08:02.470
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, we can.
So all the dashboards as well, yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/284-2
01:07:59.887 --> 01:08:02.323
<v Josh Sparkes>England. Instead,
they're wanted to as needed.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/286-1
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:06.233
<v Parik Narain>to all all the dashboards as well up it
can be PDF, PDF too.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/286-2
01:08:06.233 --> 01:08:09.380
<v Parik Narain>So we can create PDF copies of dashboards
as well.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/286-3
01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:13.883
<v Parik Narain>So you have both options into your
requests or the full dashboard. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/285-0
01:08:11.763 --> 01:08:12.643
<v Josh Sparkes>Show me that as well, yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/287-0
01:08:15.203 --> 01:08:18.776
<v Josh Sparkes>Let me just go back through in terms of
resembling 3.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/287-1
01:08:18.776 --> 01:08:24.135
<v Josh Sparkes>You could have the service now reference
maybe rather than you know sort of have</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/287-2
01:08:24.135 --> 01:08:29.163
<v Josh Sparkes>that number unique that will change,
that could be referred to service now.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/287-3
01:08:29.163 --> 01:08:30.883
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've got rather than.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/288-0
01:08:31.843 --> 01:08:34.267
<v Josh Sparkes>This PDF copies and we've got a
challenging.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/288-1
01:08:34.267 --> 01:08:38.306
<v Josh Sparkes>Whether that reference to ServiceNow
request is sufficient because I would</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/288-2
01:08:38.306 --> 01:08:41.753
<v Josh Sparkes>have all your metrics that the date it
was requested, the date,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/288-3
01:08:41.753 --> 01:08:44.607
<v Josh Sparkes>the money came in,
the amount that came in the date,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/288-4
01:08:44.607 --> 01:08:47.570
<v Josh Sparkes>it was closed.
So you've got lots of different metrics</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/288-5
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:48.323
<v Josh Sparkes>that you need.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/289-0
01:08:48.763 --> 01:08:51.283
<v Josh Sparkes>Would that be sufficient for the auditor?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/290-0
01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:56.742
<v Josh Sparkes>And equally, what are we,
auditor checking you against?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/290-1
01:08:56.742 --> 01:09:00.242
<v Josh Sparkes>That's probably the next question.
So if we know that then we create fields</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/290-2
01:09:00.242 --> 01:09:03.511
<v Josh Sparkes>that are associated with that,
it might be actually we've got this one</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/290-3
01:09:03.511 --> 01:09:06.412
<v Josh Sparkes>piece of information,
it seemed that actually ServiceNow could</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/290-4
01:09:06.412 --> 01:09:09.497
<v Josh Sparkes>have easily picked that up.
So it's whether the reference would be</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/290-5
01:09:09.497 --> 01:09:10.003
<v Josh Sparkes>sufficient.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/291-0
01:09:10.523 --> 01:09:13.583
<v Josh Sparkes>And if not,
what do we need to include for them to</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/291-1
01:09:13.583 --> 01:09:16.223
<v Josh Sparkes>sign off?
That audit's been done correctly.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/291-2
01:09:16.223 --> 01:09:19.043
<v Josh Sparkes>The auditors are checking what we're
checking,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/291-3
01:09:19.043 --> 01:09:23.543
<v Josh Sparkes>they're checking that the time or date
that the request has been received,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/291-4
01:09:23.543 --> 01:09:27.743
<v Josh Sparkes>that it's before the money has been
received in three writes that the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/291-5
01:09:27.743 --> 01:09:29.723
<v Josh Sparkes>information that was given to us.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/292-0
01:09:29.763 --> 01:09:34.461
<v Josh Sparkes>Is the is what is actually showing in
three that we received the money against</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/292-1
01:09:34.461 --> 01:09:38.386
<v Josh Sparkes>that the client matches.
So the time sense can be quite important</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/292-2
01:09:38.386 --> 01:09:42.787
<v Josh Sparkes>to make sure that we've got the
information before the money is landed in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/292-3
01:09:42.787 --> 01:09:45.403
<v Josh Sparkes>our account. It's in Australia,
it's not a.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/293-0
01:09:46.283 --> 01:09:51.253
<v Josh Sparkes>But if we do anything that's against the
regulations, it's called a breach.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/293-1
01:09:51.253 --> 01:09:54.523
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not a breach in Australia if we
don't do it,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/293-2
01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:59.623
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's always just best practise to be
having that information before we've</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/293-3
01:09:59.623 --> 01:10:01.323
<v Josh Sparkes>proceeded the money, yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/294-0
01:10:01.843 --> 01:10:07.579
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. And I think we started today,
they very good at giving you that metrics</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/294-1
01:10:07.579 --> 01:10:13.542
<v Josh Sparkes>so that you're not much effectively going
back and doing that through history.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/294-2
01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:17.843
<v Josh Sparkes>You know going back on.
So would it be useful therefore?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/295-0
01:10:18.683 --> 01:10:22.806
<v Josh Sparkes>I suppose let's come back to that
reference in a minute that when you close</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/295-1
01:10:22.806 --> 01:10:26.169
<v Josh Sparkes>complete that the money's come in,
you've done those cheques.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/295-2
01:10:26.169 --> 01:10:29.695
<v Josh Sparkes>The money is being received in three on a
certain day. You know,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/295-3
01:10:29.695 --> 01:10:32.353
<v Josh Sparkes>you can start to have on your records.
You know,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/295-4
01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:36.476
<v Josh Sparkes>there's three things that you mentioned
in ServiceNow and that also becomes</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/295-5
01:10:36.476 --> 01:10:37.723
<v Josh Sparkes>supporting evidence of.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/296-0
01:10:37.843 --> 01:10:42.205
<v Josh Sparkes>The audits that you've done,
cheques that the auditors are checking</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/296-1
01:10:42.205 --> 01:10:45.347
<v Josh Sparkes>you on,
that you've done the cheques as it were.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/296-2
01:10:45.347 --> 01:10:49.901
<v Josh Sparkes>Would that be helpful, you know,
request was before the money came in,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/296-3
01:10:49.901 --> 01:10:53.043
<v Josh Sparkes>money has been received in three,
the amount is.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/297-0
01:10:54.003 --> 01:10:57.861
<v Josh Sparkes>No money matches those three questions.
Yeah. Anything.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/297-1
01:10:57.861 --> 01:11:01.926
<v Josh Sparkes>Any other thing is that if there's using
Martin's example,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/297-2
01:11:01.926 --> 01:11:07.161
<v Josh Sparkes>if there's any change from the original
regards. So we're expecting 10,000,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/297-3
01:11:07.161 --> 01:11:12.603
<v Josh Sparkes>we're going to receive five that there's
an option or there's space for us to.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/299-0
01:11:13.043 --> 01:11:17.016
<v Josh Sparkes>Attach additional information or
additional supporting information from</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/299-1
01:11:17.016 --> 01:11:20.877
<v Josh Sparkes>the PE to say Yep, things have changed.
We are only expecting 5K now.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/299-2
01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:25.291
<v Josh Sparkes>We're not expecting another five any
anytime soon. So you can close that. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/299-3
01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:29.428
<v Josh Sparkes>And that could be able to, you know,
rather than it be pretext we can have</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/299-4
01:11:29.428 --> 01:11:31.083
<v Josh Sparkes>that three that root cause of.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/300-0
01:11:31.523 --> 01:11:34.444
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes,
matter change accepted by PE or you know</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/300-1
01:11:34.444 --> 01:11:37.301
<v Josh Sparkes>this is the amount I'm expecting more
later.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/300-2
01:11:37.301 --> 01:11:42.252
<v Josh Sparkes>You know you can start to capture it
rather than just entering a free text on</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/300-3
01:11:42.252 --> 01:11:45.173
<v Josh Sparkes>that.
So we could get some of those criterias</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/300-4
01:11:45.173 --> 01:11:48.283
<v Josh Sparkes>of why I mean I don't know how often it
happens.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/301-0
01:11:49.043 --> 01:11:53.661
<v Josh Sparkes>But equally got the amount worth more,
maybe just to find why you receive more</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/301-1
01:11:53.661 --> 01:11:58.395
<v Josh Sparkes>money if it's more difficult to explain
why it's less and if more money comes in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/301-2
01:11:58.395 --> 01:12:02.837
<v Josh Sparkes>and what can happen quite often smells,
we'll see that money is coming from</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/301-3
01:12:02.837 --> 01:12:03.363
<v Josh Sparkes>source A.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/302-0
01:12:04.283 --> 01:12:06.961
<v Josh Sparkes>And the money comes from a completely
different source.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/302-1
01:12:06.961 --> 01:12:10.737
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have to go back to them and see the
money's came from someone different.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/302-2
01:12:10.737 --> 01:12:14.466
<v Josh Sparkes>You use expecting the money from them.
And does this make sense and have they</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/302-3
01:12:14.466 --> 01:12:18.290
<v Josh Sparkes>been money laundered and stuff like that.
And looking back with the response of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/302-4
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:20.824
<v Josh Sparkes>some things,
I think there needs to be an option for</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/302-5
01:12:20.824 --> 01:12:21.923
<v Josh Sparkes>that free text because.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/304-0
01:12:22.803 --> 01:12:26.776
<v Josh Sparkes>We want we we always want to cover our
own backside to swell that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/304-1
01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:31.400
<v Josh Sparkes>We have challenged something not right.
And if we know those come in as well,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/303-0
01:12:31.283 --> 01:12:31.443
<v Mark Sedge>Nope.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/304-2
01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:36.262
<v Josh Sparkes>they will also look to make sure that the
people that have paid us money or money</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/304-3
01:12:36.262 --> 01:12:37.803
<v Josh Sparkes>we've paid paid money too.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/305-0
01:12:38.483 --> 01:12:42.227
<v Josh Sparkes>Have been linked to this matter and what
that association is with the matter,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/305-1
01:12:42.227 --> 01:12:45.539
<v Josh Sparkes>so we need to show that we have
challenged some things and we've got</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/305-2
01:12:45.539 --> 01:12:49.235
<v Josh Sparkes>people come in as a team right there.
So yeah, so once you've got that tree,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/305-3
01:12:49.235 --> 01:12:52.931
<v Josh Sparkes>as I said that drop down you you will
also have your work notes that you can</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/305-4
01:12:52.931 --> 01:12:56.723
<v Josh Sparkes>add the commentary to you know you can
take inventionship with your own notes.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/307-0
01:12:57.683 --> 01:12:59.380
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I was just going to say your</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/307-1
01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:03.257
<v Josh Sparkes>communications are all captured as well.
You're not sending separate emails and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/307-2
01:13:03.257 --> 01:13:07.038
<v Josh Sparkes>stuff. It's all through service now.
So you'll be able to see a full chain of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/307-3
01:13:07.038 --> 01:13:10.382
<v Josh Sparkes>all those conversations. Yeah,
I'll show you that a bit a bit later,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/308-0
01:13:10.123 --> 01:13:13.753
<v Mark Sedge>Parrot just sorry guys.
Parrot's had his hand up cup throughout</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/307-4
01:13:10.382 --> 01:13:10.963
<v Josh Sparkes>if you like.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/306-0
01:13:12.323 --> 01:13:12.723
<v Parik Narain>And and.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/308-1
01:13:13.753 --> 01:13:13.923
<v Mark Sedge>so.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/311-0
01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:18.196
<v Parik Narain>Thanks. Thanks mark. Just just, Debbie,
what you just said and looking at the a</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/309-0
01:13:14.363 --> 01:13:14.483
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/311-1
01:13:18.196 --> 01:13:21.353
<v Parik Narain>few of the cheques,
which auditors do there are three or four</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/311-2
01:13:21.353 --> 01:13:24.102
<v Parik Narain>ways to do it.
Obviously that you guys have discussed</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/311-3
01:13:24.102 --> 01:13:27.920
<v Parik Narain>anyway one is we capture the right
details on the catalogue form itself so</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/311-4
01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:31.585
<v Parik Narain>that you know for each request type
you're capturing or the matter type</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/311-5
01:13:31.585 --> 01:13:33.723
<v Parik Narain>you're capturing all the details you need.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/312-0
01:13:34.403 --> 01:13:36.943
<v Parik Narain>To submit that now when it come becomes a
matter itself,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/312-1
01:13:36.943 --> 01:13:40.463
<v Parik Narain>then the ways of working on the matter
matter would be important. For example,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/312-2
01:13:40.463 --> 01:13:42.958
<v Parik Narain>putting the data of communications,
etcetera, etcetera.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/312-3
01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:46.656
<v Parik Narain>So we have to just make sure that we have
all the fields available and so it's not</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/312-4
01:13:46.656 --> 01:13:49.997
<v Parik Narain>to help you with that. And thirdly,
when you're working on things outside,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/312-5
01:13:49.997 --> 01:13:50.843
<v Parik Narain>so it's not like 3.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/313-0
01:13:51.323 --> 01:13:55.267
<v Parik Narain>So dates which you need to match,
for example they should be populated by</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/313-1
01:13:55.267 --> 01:13:59.583
<v Parik Narain>three either manually for now and then
hopefully we'll automate it at some point</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/313-2
01:13:59.583 --> 01:14:03.100
<v Parik Narain>so that ServiceNow becomes the centre of
the centre of, you know,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/313-3
01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:06.243
<v Parik Narain>communication and source of truth for
most of your audits.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/314-0
01:14:06.723 --> 01:14:10.913
<v Parik Narain>So three or four ways where we can solve
this for you and the metrics as well as</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/314-1
01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:13.965
<v Parik Narain>Debbie mentioned,
which will capture things at the back at</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/314-2
01:14:13.965 --> 01:14:16.861
<v Parik Narain>the back end as you're progressing
through your matter.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/314-3
01:14:16.861 --> 01:14:20.016
<v Parik Narain>How long do you take to resolve,
what legal matter etcetera,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/314-4
01:14:20.016 --> 01:14:23.843
<v Parik Narain>how much you know time it's taken to come
from this state one to state 2.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/315-0
01:14:24.323 --> 01:14:26.920
<v Parik Narain>Or how many times are they?
Has it hopped from one team to another?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/315-1
01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.363
<v Parik Narain>All those metrics can also be captured as
well in the back end.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/317-0
01:14:35.643 --> 01:14:40.176
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got the requests coming in there
through the checklist checklist leading</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/317-1
01:14:40.176 --> 01:14:42.758
<v Josh Sparkes>questions,
but check the matter that's then.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/317-2
01:14:42.758 --> 01:14:47.291
<v Josh Sparkes>You would then check that's the case,
and then you've got this ability to have</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/317-3
01:14:47.291 --> 01:14:48.323
<v Josh Sparkes>another checklist.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/318-0
01:14:48.723 --> 01:14:54.083
<v Josh Sparkes>Make sure that the money has been
received, the correct amounts, etcetera.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/318-1
01:14:54.083 --> 01:14:58.943
<v Josh Sparkes>And then that communication.
Then it's closed and at which point as</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/318-2
01:14:58.943 --> 01:15:04.803
<v Josh Sparkes>Phil was saying that the person could be
notified that that's complete, so if we.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/319-0
01:15:05.283 --> 01:15:10.104
<v Josh Sparkes>In the case that we I haven't received
the money in account for a month or so,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/319-1
01:15:10.104 --> 01:15:13.460
<v Josh Sparkes>which happens,
would that request just kind of stay on</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/319-2
01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:16.573
<v Josh Sparkes>our dashboard until we close it off? Yeah,
I mean,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/319-3
01:15:16.573 --> 01:15:21.332
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be that it's wasn't just saying
your dashboard is this long. I mean,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/319-4
01:15:21.332 --> 01:15:22.003
<v Josh Sparkes>what's the?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/320-0
01:15:23.723 --> 01:15:26.651
<v Josh Sparkes>It will be a growing length of time,
you know,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/320-1
01:15:26.651 --> 01:15:31.324
<v Josh Sparkes>so you can see these things are actually
taking longer. I don't know what.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/320-2
01:15:31.324 --> 01:15:35.498
<v Josh Sparkes>So I mean when you receive typically from
the PE or the requester,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/320-3
01:15:35.498 --> 01:15:40.045
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean it could be and that's probably
about it's coming in an hour. Oh,</v>

01:15:40.045 --> 01:15:42.163
<v Josh Sparkes>did you get it today? Has it been?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/321-0
01:15:42.323 --> 01:15:47.537
<v Josh Sparkes>We variation in that whole conversation
within a happy path if they're requesting,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/321-1
01:15:47.537 --> 01:15:51.809
<v Josh Sparkes>if they're all up to date,
please know that when the money comes in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/321-2
01:15:51.809 --> 01:15:55.327
<v Josh Sparkes>is as expected.
Normally a turn around you'll get it in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/321-3
01:15:55.327 --> 01:16:00.163
<v Josh Sparkes>the 30 day periods or it could be, yeah.
Generally we're expecting a day of.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/322-0
01:16:00.483 --> 01:16:02.957
<v Josh Sparkes>Following day, yeah,
all the following day. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/322-1
01:16:02.957 --> 01:16:05.679
<v Josh Sparkes>Couple of business days. Not for us.
We can have them.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/322-2
01:16:05.679 --> 01:16:09.587
<v Josh Sparkes>We can wait months and months and months
when the funds to arrive because they</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/322-3
01:16:09.587 --> 01:16:13.694
<v Josh Sparkes>will say to the client we need you to pay
this to cover for the party costs and we</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/322-4
01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:17.503
<v Josh Sparkes>won't do any more work until you give us
that. If the clients are quick pay,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/322-5
01:16:17.503 --> 01:16:20.323
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll get the money quickly.
But sometimes it's monthly.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/323-0
01:16:20.843 --> 01:16:25.159
<v Josh Sparkes>So what share wells quick with that is
someone will say we expect the money to</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/323-1
01:16:25.159 --> 01:16:27.672
<v Josh Sparkes>arrive by the end of this month.
For example,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/323-2
01:16:27.672 --> 01:16:30.295
<v Josh Sparkes>we can put that pending to the 1st of
November.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/323-3
01:16:30.295 --> 01:16:33.026
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's kind of felt of the way it's
still there,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/323-4
01:16:33.026 --> 01:16:34.883
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's not in the line of sight.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/324-0
01:16:35.363 --> 01:16:39.643
<v Josh Sparkes>And then in the 1st of November,
it flicks back into an active queue and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/324-1
01:16:39.643 --> 01:16:44.274
<v Josh Sparkes>we can kind of follow up with the the
fear and the money's still not here yet.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/324-2
01:16:44.274 --> 01:16:49.081
<v Josh Sparkes>You still expecting that or is that a new
kind of expected? Yeah. Expected dates?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/324-3
01:16:49.081 --> 01:16:51.837
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.
All that check is we can add the date and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/324-4
01:16:51.837 --> 01:16:53.243
<v Josh Sparkes>when that's breached or.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/325-0
01:16:53.923 --> 01:16:59.406
<v Josh Sparkes>In the future that can come up on your
dashboards that most certainly I'm</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/325-1
01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:03.630
<v Josh Sparkes>thinking along.
Also having including maybe a reason for</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/325-2
01:17:03.630 --> 01:17:09.483
<v Josh Sparkes>the money, it could be the body parts,
it could be prepayment of legal fees or</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/325-3
01:17:09.483 --> 01:17:11.483
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be for settlement.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/326-0
01:17:13.483 --> 01:17:17.854
<v Josh Sparkes>A few different reasons, but if it's for,
say, a settlement,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/326-1
01:17:17.854 --> 01:17:23.801
<v Josh Sparkes>then it would be good to then have what's
the expected settlement date or expected</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/326-2
01:17:23.801 --> 01:17:28.243
<v Josh Sparkes>settlement month because then we could
have that if possible.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/327-0
01:17:28.643 --> 01:17:33.553
<v Josh Sparkes>We can say we've proceeded the money,
but there's an expected settlement date</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/327-1
01:17:33.553 --> 01:17:38.526
<v Josh Sparkes>of the 31st of January 2027 and it's just
kind of hot stuff into back onto our</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/327-2
01:17:38.526 --> 01:17:43.625
<v Josh Sparkes>dashboard the month that we're expecting
settlement so that we know that we have</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/327-3
01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:48.283
<v Josh Sparkes>the the money still in the trust account
available and we'll expect that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/328-0
01:17:48.523 --> 01:17:53.719
<v Josh Sparkes>Settlement,
one of Australia's other processes is</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/328-1
01:17:53.719 --> 01:17:57.563
<v Josh Sparkes>statutory deposits which walk across.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/329-0
01:17:59.003 --> 01:18:03.485
<v Josh Sparkes>Two two of our trust accounts,
which are our two biggest ones,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/329-1
01:18:03.485 --> 01:18:09.033
<v Josh Sparkes>we can't keep the full balance of our
trust account of our trust money in our</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/329-2
01:18:09.033 --> 01:18:11.949
<v Josh Sparkes>account.
So we have to deposit a certain</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/329-3
01:18:11.949 --> 01:18:16.003
<v Josh Sparkes>percentage of that every 12:45 of our
regulatory bodies.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/330-0
01:18:16.403 --> 01:18:21.223
<v Josh Sparkes>Which means that if we've only got $2,000,
000 sitting in our trust account for</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/330-1
01:18:21.223 --> 01:18:23.994
<v Josh Sparkes>Melbourne,
but we know we've got a $4 million</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/330-2
01:18:23.994 --> 01:18:27.669
<v Josh Sparkes>settlement coming up,
we need a minimum 24 hours to get that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/330-3
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:32.308
<v Josh Sparkes>money back from our Regulatory Board
board to then be able to have the funds</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/330-4
01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:36.043
<v Josh Sparkes>in our account to pay that settlement.
So I'm just trying to.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/331-0
01:18:36.123 --> 01:18:37.763
<v Josh Sparkes>I think good cross.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/332-0
01:18:39.563 --> 01:18:43.956
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, within that workflow,
you sort of got if settlement accounts,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/332-1
01:18:43.956 --> 01:18:48.931
<v Josh Sparkes>you know there is that sub task that
comes from that and would the requester</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/332-2
01:18:48.931 --> 01:18:52.936
<v Josh Sparkes>know you get that info,
you know the reason for the money are</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/332-3
01:18:52.936 --> 01:18:54.163
<v Josh Sparkes>they entering that?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/334-0
01:18:54.643 --> 01:18:57.763
<v Josh Sparkes>Information.
Or is that something you're populating</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/334-1
01:18:57.763 --> 01:19:01.183
<v Josh Sparkes>afterwards, Hun?
I think we I think in Australia we just</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/334-2
01:19:01.183 --> 01:19:05.983
<v Josh Sparkes>ask for it. It's not a field on the form,
but we ask it's it's good to know and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/333-0
01:19:04.123 --> 01:19:04.443
<v Mark Sedge>If it.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/334-3
01:19:05.983 --> 01:19:09.883
<v Josh Sparkes>it's something to track and we all do.
I'm just thinking people.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/336-0
01:19:10.763 --> 01:19:13.003
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll get the regulatory compliance.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/335-0
01:19:11.723 --> 01:19:12.083
<v Mark Sedge>If it.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/339-0
01:19:13.563 --> 01:19:16.817
<v Mark Sedge>If it's something that you're going to
ask the client to do,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/339-1
01:19:16.817 --> 01:19:19.377
<v Mark Sedge>then it's worthwhile locking it in a pick
list.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/339-2
01:19:19.377 --> 01:19:23.590
<v Mark Sedge>So if you know you've got sort of the
common ones that are being asked because</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/338-0
01:19:22.723 --> 01:19:22.963
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/339-3
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:26.203
<v Mark Sedge>it will,
then logically steer them to select and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/339-4
01:19:26.203 --> 01:19:30.577
<v Mark Sedge>you can make that mandatory and then if
they select it's a settlement you can put</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/339-5
01:19:30.577 --> 01:19:32.443
<v Mark Sedge>by that selection you can pop up a.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/341-0
01:19:33.003 --> 01:19:37.531
<v Mark Sedge>Window that then enables them to select
the date of when that settlement's due,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/340-0
01:19:37.003 --> 01:19:37.203
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/341-1
01:19:37.531 --> 01:19:40.643
<v Mark Sedge>so we can you can get those controls
through the form.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/342-0
01:19:41.523 --> 01:19:46.291
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. And in that case,
if I have a settlement of 30th of January</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/342-1
01:19:46.291 --> 01:19:49.324
<v Josh Sparkes>2027,
then once we close off that request</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/342-2
01:19:49.324 --> 01:19:53.441
<v Josh Sparkes>because we've received the money into our
trust account,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/342-3
01:19:53.441 --> 01:19:56.763
<v Josh Sparkes>it would create a kind of sub task to pop
up.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/344-0
01:19:57.563 --> 01:19:59.720
<v Josh Sparkes>Within the,
you know within the month of that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/343-0
01:19:57.923 --> 01:19:58.563
<v Mark Sedge>Well, you've got.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/344-1
01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:00.563
<v Josh Sparkes>settlement, right?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/345-0
01:20:00.603 --> 01:20:04.130
<v Mark Sedge>It depends. Yeah.
So what you it depends what you do with</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/345-1
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:07.170
<v Mark Sedge>the state of the case,
because if you if once it,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/345-2
01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:12.277
<v Mark Sedge>the money's in you might you might have a
state money's in waiting you know waiting</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/345-3
01:20:12.277 --> 01:20:17.080
<v Mark Sedge>final transaction or something and then
you can drive your dashboard by any of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/345-4
01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.843
<v Mark Sedge>those that are in that state.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/346-0
01:20:19.163 --> 01:20:22.755
<v Mark Sedge>Or when is the due date and you can have
a flag say five days,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/346-1
01:20:22.755 --> 01:20:27.316
<v Mark Sedge>5 working days before that date to enable
you to see on your dashboard anything</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/346-2
01:20:27.316 --> 01:20:31.363
<v Mark Sedge>that pops up red that you need to.
You obviously take action on. Yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/346-3
01:20:31.363 --> 01:20:35.810
<v Mark Sedge>there's a number of ways of doing it.
I think what what we probably just need</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/346-4
01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:38.603
<v Mark Sedge>to do is work through the specific go on
parrot.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/347-0
01:20:38.883 --> 01:20:39.683
<v Mark Sedge>Got hand up.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/348-0
01:20:41.563 --> 01:20:43.879
<v Parik Narain>Thanks, mark.
Just to add to your point around states</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/348-1
01:20:43.879 --> 01:20:46.238
<v Parik Narain>right there,
there's a again a principle we follow the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/348-2
01:20:46.238 --> 01:20:48.639
<v Parik Narain>the state field,
which you might see on the matter that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/348-3
01:20:48.639 --> 01:20:52.027
<v Parik Narain>state field is is very generic because
that kind of corresponds to the general</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/348-4
01:20:52.027 --> 01:20:54.386
<v Parik Narain>request state,
but which are the if there are specific</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/348-5
01:20:54.386 --> 01:20:56.316
<v Parik Narain>reasons to which you are putting a state
on,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/348-6
01:20:56.316 --> 01:20:59.403
<v Parik Narain>you can actually have something called a
sub state which we can create.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/349-0
01:20:59.883 --> 01:21:03.470
<v Parik Narain>Very, very specific to each workflow,
just like Mark mentioned. You know,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/349-1
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:06.863
<v Parik Narain>if you are awaiting money transfer you
can put your state to pending,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/349-2
01:21:06.863 --> 01:21:10.595
<v Parik Narain>but you can put a sub state to money
transfer so that you can break down why</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/349-3
01:21:10.595 --> 01:21:14.085
<v Parik Narain>you're putting something pending.
What we generally don't like to do is</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/349-4
01:21:14.085 --> 01:21:16.363
<v Parik Narain>change the actual state model of the
platform.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/351-0
01:21:17.043 --> 01:21:19.824
<v Parik Narain>For each process,
but we actually try and complement that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/351-1
01:21:19.824 --> 01:21:23.469
<v Parik Narain>with a sub state which is specific to
each flow and then that sub state can</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/351-2
01:21:23.469 --> 01:21:26.873
<v Parik Narain>also drive activities within your back
end workflow which is going on.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/351-3
01:21:26.873 --> 01:21:30.709
<v Parik Narain>For example after putting something in
depending you have to wait for four days</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/351-4
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:31.763
<v Parik Narain>to do the next action.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/352-0
01:21:32.243 --> 01:21:36.219
<v Parik Narain>We can make make sure that's programmed
into the flow to begin the next activity</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/352-1
01:21:36.219 --> 01:21:39.705
<v Parik Narain>at the at the right time based on a
business schedule or whatever that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/352-2
01:21:39.705 --> 01:21:42.257
<v Parik Narain>threshold is.
So there are a lot of avenues to play</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/352-3
01:21:42.257 --> 01:21:45.693
<v Parik Narain>around with this and the and lastly,
what I want to mention is there,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/352-4
01:21:45.693 --> 01:21:49.620
<v Parik Narain>there's a very powerful capability called
service level agreements and OP Olas,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/352-5
01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:51.043
<v Parik Narain>which we generally use in IT.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/353-0
01:21:51.443 --> 01:21:56.087
<v Parik Narain>But to check these time bound thresholds
and to create reports and create warnings</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/353-1
01:21:56.087 --> 01:22:00.338
<v Parik Narain>or or e-mail e-mail based alerts,
you can actually leverage that capability</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/353-2
01:22:00.338 --> 01:22:04.646
<v Parik Narain>as well to track a longer timeline.
If it's 1824 months in the in the future</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/353-3
01:22:04.646 --> 01:22:07.163
<v Parik Narain>or six months or three months in the
future.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/354-0
01:22:07.803 --> 01:22:11.516
<v Parik Narain>Then that kind of always appears under
your matter as a separate line item and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/354-1
01:22:11.516 --> 01:22:14.524
<v Parik Narain>show and shows how you are meeting that
guide timeline as well,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/354-2
01:22:14.524 --> 01:22:18.331
<v Parik Narain>and then that can drive you to, you know,
take certain actions as well manually.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/354-3
01:22:18.331 --> 01:22:20.963
<v Parik Narain>So multiple ways to do it.
I just want to mention that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/356-0
01:22:22.283 --> 01:22:26.083
<v Josh Sparkes>Could that settlement date be tied into a
report that can build or something?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/356-1
01:22:26.083 --> 01:22:30.028
<v Josh Sparkes>If somebody say we're going to transact
in the 1st of December and then we close</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/356-2
01:22:30.028 --> 01:22:32.707
<v Josh Sparkes>that ticket off,
but then we could run a report saying</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/355-0
01:22:32.643 --> 01:22:32.883
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/356-3
01:22:32.707 --> 01:22:36.554
<v Josh Sparkes>actually we've got 10 people that have
said the 1st of December because one of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/356-4
01:22:36.554 --> 01:22:38.843
<v Josh Sparkes>the biggest challenges we've got as a
team is.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/358-0
01:22:39.403 --> 01:22:42.856
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't know what volumes we're going to
get on a day-to-day basis.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/358-1
01:22:42.856 --> 01:22:46.858
<v Josh Sparkes>So when you're trying to organise team
meetings and stuff like that, it's yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/358-2
01:22:46.858 --> 01:22:49.860
<v Josh Sparkes>just open that you get a quiet period for
another to do it.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/358-3
01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:53.812
<v Josh Sparkes>But as if we had some sort of report that
said actually on Monday and Tuesday,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/358-4
01:22:53.812 --> 01:22:56.163
<v Josh Sparkes>the volumes are going to be higher to
help us.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/361-0
01:22:55.243 --> 01:22:57.798
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty.
I'm pretty certain.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/360-0
01:22:56.443 --> 01:23:00.083
<v Josh Sparkes>Definitely can report that. So that's.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/361-1
01:22:57.798 --> 01:23:02.093
<v Mark Sedge>I'm pretty certain that that can be
sorted for you just to even out that,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/359-0
01:22:58.323 --> 01:22:58.523
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/361-2
01:23:02.093 --> 01:23:06.447
<v Mark Sedge>otherwise you get a demand spike is what
what you're describing, isn't it,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/361-3
01:23:06.447 --> 01:23:11.206
<v Mark Sedge>where you've got lots to do on one single
day and you want to be able to pre empt</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/361-4
01:23:11.206 --> 01:23:12.483
<v Mark Sedge>and even it out? Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/362-0
01:23:14.243 --> 01:23:17.052
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, absolutely.
And I know it won't always back that we</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/362-1
01:23:17.052 --> 01:23:20.586
<v Josh Sparkes>get people telling us like when it
transacted in the 1st of December and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/362-2
01:23:20.586 --> 01:23:23.975
<v Josh Sparkes>then it still gets kept for another six
months because things change.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/362-3
01:23:23.975 --> 01:23:27.025
<v Josh Sparkes>But it gives us more visibility than what
we've got right now.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/362-4
01:23:27.025 --> 01:23:29.203
<v Josh Sparkes>What we can also do is have interactive,
so.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/363-0
01:23:30.563 --> 01:23:34.662
<v Josh Sparkes>Settlement date in the next three months
settlement date in the next seven days.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/363-1
01:23:34.662 --> 01:23:37.344
<v Josh Sparkes>Seven days,
which has passed in the last seven days.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/363-2
01:23:37.344 --> 01:23:40.380
<v Josh Sparkes>For example. Yeah,
that's all we need to start a bit there.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/363-3
01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:43.670
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's very easy for you to have them
and that's always a good,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/363-4
01:23:43.670 --> 01:23:47.363
<v Josh Sparkes>very powerful ones. But again,
that effective date and settlement dates.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/364-0
01:23:48.483 --> 01:23:48.643
<v Josh Sparkes>So.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/365-0
01:23:50.483 --> 01:23:51.283
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's good.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/366-0
01:23:56.003 --> 01:24:00.723
<v Josh Sparkes>Just going by reminding my own question,
having that ServiceNow referenced while</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/366-1
01:24:00.723 --> 01:24:03.520
<v Josh Sparkes>the PDF,
it says it's challenging that wouldn't</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/366-2
01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.666
<v Josh Sparkes>out, you know,
these things that can then go into the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/366-3
01:24:06.666 --> 01:24:10.803
<v Josh Sparkes>boss or they get they can be attached to
an e-mail then they you know.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/367-0
01:24:12.083 --> 01:24:15.662
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm only challenging completing like
reports when you e-mail them,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/367-1
01:24:15.662 --> 01:24:19.989
<v Josh Sparkes>they can be changed and all you know that
types of when you're when we put stuff</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/367-2
01:24:19.989 --> 01:24:22.285
<v Josh Sparkes>into free,
don't want everybody across the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/367-3
01:24:22.285 --> 01:24:25.864
<v Josh Sparkes>businesses get access to view those
attached. Well, not everybody.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/367-4
01:24:25.864 --> 01:24:30.083
<v Josh Sparkes>But once people get access to view those
attachments and even across teams so.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/368-0
01:24:30.763 --> 01:24:34.916
<v Josh Sparkes>The billing team could issue a bill and
it could be disbursements on it.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/368-1
01:24:34.916 --> 01:24:39.523
<v Josh Sparkes>They won't have access to a ServiceNow
dashboard to look up at the ticket to get</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/368-2
01:24:39.523 --> 01:24:42.140
<v Josh Sparkes>back up,
but as they can get the back up from</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/368-3
01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:45.553
<v Josh Sparkes>three so to see if them happen to come to
us. So and again,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/368-4
01:24:45.553 --> 01:24:48.283
<v Josh Sparkes>lawyers and all that can get access to to
view.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/369-0
01:24:48.883 --> 01:24:53.065
<v Josh Sparkes>Request the stuff for the free system
because it can drive into the transaction,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/369-1
01:24:53.065 --> 01:24:56.989
<v Josh Sparkes>but if it was all stored in service now
only they would always have to come</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/369-2
01:24:56.989 --> 01:25:00.758
<v Josh Sparkes>through as to get that back up.
So it's not just from the audit point of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/369-3
01:25:00.758 --> 01:25:03.132
<v Josh Sparkes>view,
it's from visibility of other people in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/369-4
01:25:03.132 --> 01:25:03.803
<v Josh Sparkes>the business.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/370-0
01:25:04.123 --> 01:25:04.243
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/371-0
01:25:09.923 --> 01:25:16.460
<v Josh Sparkes>We've done the new request coming in so
and do you have situations where there's</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/371-1
01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:20.898
<v Josh Sparkes>any exceptions or VI,
PS or some things are handled by</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/371-2
01:25:20.898 --> 01:25:24.933
<v Josh Sparkes>exception?
I don't know if you have any of those,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/371-3
01:25:24.933 --> 01:25:28.483
<v Josh Sparkes>we might say, well,
everyone is in the VIP.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/372-0
01:25:28.883 --> 01:25:31.796
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
but are there particular things you know,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/372-1
01:25:31.796 --> 01:25:34.891
<v Josh Sparkes>as you said,
there's probably large amounts, yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/372-2
01:25:34.891 --> 01:25:39.745
<v Josh Sparkes>that are handled differently or you have
to get anything differently with them.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/372-3
01:25:39.745 --> 01:25:44.235
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the main thing for us is
prioritising when we know settlements is</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/372-4
01:25:44.235 --> 01:25:47.390
<v Josh Sparkes>going to be.
So if we have funds that are coming in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/372-5
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:48.603
<v Josh Sparkes>today and they have.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/373-0
01:25:48.723 --> 01:25:53.435
<v Josh Sparkes>To go out today that gets prioritised
over the sun's coming in today,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/373-1
01:25:53.435 --> 01:25:57.945
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's going out next week.
That's probably the only difference.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/373-2
01:25:57.945 --> 01:26:01.311
<v Josh Sparkes>Everyone. Everything is. Yeah,
it's a second one.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/373-3
01:26:01.311 --> 01:26:04.003
<v Josh Sparkes>Ones that have the priority. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/374-0
01:26:04.923 --> 01:26:08.969
<v Josh Sparkes>It doesn't really matter in the value at
the end of the day if a client needs</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/374-1
01:26:08.969 --> 01:26:11.769
<v Josh Sparkes>money paid out, and that's 1 LB and 100,
000,000 lbs,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/374-2
01:26:11.769 --> 01:26:14.051
<v Josh Sparkes>that client wants the transaction
approved.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/374-3
01:26:14.051 --> 01:26:18.252
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's all about the next thing for us
is visibility of when these requests are</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/374-4
01:26:18.252 --> 01:26:19.963
<v Josh Sparkes>coming through. And I think when.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/376-0
01:26:20.403 --> 01:26:22.848
<v Josh Sparkes>The requests are going to come through
already,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/376-1
01:26:22.848 --> 01:26:26.667
<v Josh Sparkes>can automate it saying that it's a
payment that's going to give us quicker</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/376-2
01:26:26.667 --> 01:26:30.180
<v Josh Sparkes>visibility. What is right now,
it's almost just like an inbox and we</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/376-3
01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:34.305
<v Josh Sparkes>have to go into each one, what request is.
So I think that's this is going to be</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/375-0
01:26:31.843 --> 01:26:33.643
<v Mark Sedge>Yes, what?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/376-4
01:26:34.305 --> 01:26:36.443
<v Josh Sparkes>more efficient help you there. Yeah, yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/379-0
01:26:36.643 --> 01:26:39.300
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.
One of the things we'd aim to do in the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/377-0
01:26:37.043 --> 01:26:37.163
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/379-1
01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:43.863
<v Mark Sedge>presentation on your workspace would be
to knowing that that's the priorities.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/379-2
01:26:43.863 --> 01:26:47.329
<v Mark Sedge>Just pick up on that.
You know the date that it needs to be</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/379-3
01:26:47.329 --> 01:26:50.737
<v Mark Sedge>paid sort of thing.
And then you you get your list in that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/379-4
01:26:50.737 --> 01:26:51.083
<v Mark Sedge>order.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/380-0
01:26:51.883 --> 01:26:54.616
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.
So the top of the list is the ones you</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/380-1
01:26:54.616 --> 01:26:57.409
<v Mark Sedge>know,
that there's a payment that you have to</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/380-2
01:26:57.409 --> 01:27:01.478
<v Mark Sedge>make and then further down the list of
those that, you know, less,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/380-3
01:27:01.478 --> 01:27:06.396
<v Mark Sedge>less critical and that can be sorted at
you as a as a base level for you in your</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/380-4
01:27:06.396 --> 01:27:07.003
<v Mark Sedge>workspace.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/381-0
01:27:08.203 --> 01:27:10.884
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So then if we have that settlement day</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/381-1
01:27:10.884 --> 01:27:15.470
<v Josh Sparkes>option when we're receiving funds into
trust and if they say it's, you know,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/381-2
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:20.473
<v Josh Sparkes>settlements today or settlements tomorrow
that can be pushed right up to the top of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/381-3
01:27:20.473 --> 01:27:24.403
<v Josh Sparkes>our. But it's really easily,
I guess Martin said same thing they.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/383-0
01:27:24.923 --> 01:27:29.073
<v Josh Sparkes>It's really hard to figure out what's
sitting in our show of queuing without</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/383-1
01:27:29.073 --> 01:27:31.443
<v Josh Sparkes>which going to ever since, yeah,
certainly.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/382-0
01:27:29.163 --> 01:27:29.563
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/384-0
01:27:31.163 --> 01:27:33.632
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.
The key thing is to grab that data to</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/384-1
01:27:33.632 --> 01:27:35.763
<v Mark Sedge>enable us to present it in that order.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/385-0
01:27:36.603 --> 01:27:36.843
<v Josh Sparkes>Hmm.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/386-0
01:27:38.043 --> 01:27:40.045
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
because I think in shareware we've got</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/386-1
01:27:40.045 --> 01:27:42.892
<v Josh Sparkes>like 1 dashboard view,
but we can have multiple here, can't we?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/386-2
01:27:42.892 --> 01:27:46.272
<v Josh Sparkes>So we just build the rules behind that
around what view you want to see and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/386-3
01:27:46.272 --> 01:27:49.653
<v Josh Sparkes>you're just clicking through the
different dashboards to see that you know.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/386-4
01:27:49.653 --> 01:27:52.588
<v Josh Sparkes>So what your day looks like,
what your what next week looks like,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/386-5
01:27:52.588 --> 01:27:54.723
<v Josh Sparkes>what next month like that you can display
that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/387-0
01:27:55.763 --> 01:28:01.363
<v Josh Sparkes>And just a quick question,
how many cashiers in each location?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/388-0
01:28:03.043 --> 01:28:05.922
<v Josh Sparkes>I there's six in my team,
one is my manager.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/388-1
01:28:05.922 --> 01:28:11.039
<v Josh Sparkes>She doesn't get involved in the sort of
the the business as usual transactional</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/388-2
01:28:11.039 --> 01:28:13.981
<v Josh Sparkes>stuff,
but there's sort of five of us in that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/388-3
01:28:13.981 --> 01:28:17.563
<v Josh Sparkes>week after that we have 4 1/2,
including a team leader.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/389-0
01:28:17.803 --> 01:28:21.858
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, I'm just thinking as well it will it.
You know you can assign to a particular</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/389-1
01:28:21.858 --> 01:28:24.627
<v Josh Sparkes>person, you know,
pick up the queue so you can also see</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/389-2
01:28:24.627 --> 01:28:27.100
<v Josh Sparkes>your leverage of work across your team.
You know,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/389-3
01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:30.858
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe two people are working on one,
seven people are working on the. Yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/389-4
01:28:30.858 --> 01:28:34.022
<v Josh Sparkes>that's what we tend to do.
But you're in charge of all the time</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/389-5
01:28:34.022 --> 01:28:37.483
<v Josh Sparkes>account transactions today.
So they will get assigned to that person.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/390-0
01:28:37.563 --> 01:28:39.774
<v Josh Sparkes>So someone else is in charge of something
else,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/390-1
01:28:39.774 --> 01:28:42.123
<v Josh Sparkes>and we did those tasks like weekly or
fortnightly.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/391-0
01:28:44.683 --> 01:28:48.555
<v Josh Sparkes>You don't have this. You don't have.
You do have a role based matrix,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/391-1
01:28:48.555 --> 01:28:52.923
<v Josh Sparkes>so this person deals with these clients
or anything like that. No, it's. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/391-2
01:28:52.923 --> 01:28:55.578
<v Josh Sparkes>It's more rather than dedicating it to
clients.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/391-3
01:28:55.578 --> 01:28:59.947
<v Josh Sparkes>It's your task today is to look after the
client account, someone else's task.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/391-4
01:28:59.947 --> 01:29:01.163
<v Josh Sparkes>That is to look after.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/392-0
01:29:01.803 --> 01:29:05.212
<v Josh Sparkes>Receipts that are coming to the office
account, for example,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/392-1
01:29:05.212 --> 01:29:08.174
<v Josh Sparkes>and doesn't matter if it's a specific
client or not.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/392-2
01:29:08.174 --> 01:29:10.745
<v Josh Sparkes>They're dealing with everything in that
area,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/392-3
01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:15.439
<v Josh Sparkes>but you set that on a through your team,
weekly meetings or monthly meetings, yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/392-4
01:29:15.439 --> 01:29:17.003
<v Josh Sparkes>And then just do it monthly.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/393-0
01:29:17.683 --> 01:29:20.900
<v Josh Sparkes>That's right,
to rotate the tasks of the fortnight</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/393-1
01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:24.432
<v Josh Sparkes>between the team,
but dependent holidays and stuff like</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/393-2
01:29:24.432 --> 01:29:29.477
<v Josh Sparkes>that spell we could have, as you know,
and be able to assign so that you're not</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/393-3
01:29:29.477 --> 01:29:34.270
<v Josh Sparkes>having to assign tickets on a daily basis.
We do ours on a quarterly basis,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/393-4
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:36.603
<v Josh Sparkes>so it could be a bit easier for that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/394-0
01:29:36.843 --> 01:29:42.383
<v Josh Sparkes>To assign in Australia because we do
split of trust to accounts to accounts,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/394-1
01:29:42.383 --> 01:29:46.340
<v Josh Sparkes>office receding and then some of the
other like stuff,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/394-2
01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:51.376
<v Josh Sparkes>we did have auto assign on dawn with
everybody in the team still have</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/394-3
01:29:51.376 --> 01:29:56.483
<v Josh Sparkes>visibility of that. Yeah. Yeah.
Just in case not that we not at lunch.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/395-0
01:29:57.243 --> 01:30:01.184
<v Josh Sparkes>And it can be reassigned, you know,
and but you get to see all, you know,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/395-1
01:30:01.184 --> 01:30:04.166
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got full transparency of what
everybody's doing.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/395-2
01:30:04.166 --> 01:30:08.213
<v Josh Sparkes>So that is the aspiration across the
teams is that we make the move to auto</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/395-3
01:30:08.213 --> 01:30:10.822
<v Josh Sparkes>assignment.
We just need to understand if you're</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/395-4
01:30:10.822 --> 01:30:14.283
<v Josh Sparkes>rotating that what basis that's on and
yeah and understand that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/396-0
01:30:13.883 --> 01:30:16.388
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
and and just just over the top of that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/396-1
01:30:16.388 --> 01:30:19.226
<v Mark Sedge>team, the,
the other thing to consider is that the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/396-2
01:30:19.226 --> 01:30:23.121
<v Mark Sedge>way that the groups, you know,
if you're defining players associated,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/396-3
01:30:23.121 --> 01:30:26.905
<v Mark Sedge>there's a little bit of an admin overhead
to to apply those rotors.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/396-4
01:30:26.905 --> 01:30:31.412
<v Mark Sedge>So you know it may be that you, you know,
the teams just know what they're doing</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/396-5
01:30:31.412 --> 01:30:32.803
<v Mark Sedge>and it's a central group.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/397-0
01:30:33.043 --> 01:30:37.762
<v Mark Sedge>They just pick out those items that are
pertinent to them rather than carry a</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/397-1
01:30:37.762 --> 01:30:42.300
<v Mark Sedge>sort of service overhead to adjust the
administration of the auto routing,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/397-2
01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:46.172
<v Mark Sedge>which is often why we break groups down
into skill or whatever,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/397-3
01:30:46.172 --> 01:30:49.681
<v Mark Sedge>because it supports the auto routing a
little bit easier.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/397-4
01:30:49.681 --> 01:30:52.403
<v Mark Sedge>But if you've got a general pool of
players.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/398-0
01:30:52.683 --> 01:30:57.762
<v Mark Sedge>It does make that a little bit difficult
from an administrative perspective.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/398-1
01:30:57.762 --> 01:30:58.883
<v Mark Sedge>That makes sense.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/399-0
01:31:08.163 --> 01:31:08.443
<v Mark Sedge>It's.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/401-0
01:31:08.523 --> 01:31:12.527
<v Josh Sparkes>Yourself. Exceptions, man.
You get the control finally. Tell me this.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/401-1
01:31:12.527 --> 01:31:16.130
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it will probably be one of the
ones that. Sorry, mark.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/401-2
01:31:16.130 --> 01:31:20.591
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just going to say that I think
it'll be one of those ones that we build</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/400-0
01:31:16.763 --> 01:31:18.243
<v Mark Sedge>So does so does that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/401-3
01:31:20.591 --> 01:31:23.794
<v Josh Sparkes>it in a certain way,
but we'll iterate it as we go off.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/401-4
01:31:23.794 --> 01:31:28.083
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can obviously manually rotating
that. But we don't really want that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/405-0
01:31:28.163 --> 01:31:31.114
<v Josh Sparkes>That to continue,
and it may be that once we go in and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/405-1
01:31:31.114 --> 01:31:34.922
<v Josh Sparkes>understand the system a bit better and
how things move between people,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/405-2
01:31:34.922 --> 01:31:37.389
<v Josh Sparkes>they actually don't need to do that
rotation.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/405-3
01:31:37.389 --> 01:31:40.983
<v Josh Sparkes>They can just do that and you get into
the advisor. But initially,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/405-4
01:31:40.983 --> 01:31:44.845
<v Josh Sparkes>as you said that auto refine will give
you know as you come in use your</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/405-5
01:31:44.845 --> 01:31:46.883
<v Josh Sparkes>dashboard as your daily calendar like.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/404-0
01:31:45.283 --> 01:31:45.403
<v Mark Sedge>Sure.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/406-0
01:31:47.643 --> 01:31:50.434
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, I've got this.
How much have I got today?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/406-1
01:31:50.434 --> 01:31:54.863
<v Josh Sparkes>Or this person doesn't have, you know,
you could reassign on that basis,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/406-2
01:31:54.863 --> 01:31:59.232
<v Josh Sparkes>but rather than going in and assigning on
a daily basis the first part,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/406-3
01:31:59.232 --> 01:32:02.083
<v Josh Sparkes>the first part of all,
it will be assigned to.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/407-0
01:32:02.443 --> 01:32:06.593
<v Josh Sparkes>And then you could reallocate accordingly.
If you need to think about violence</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/407-1
01:32:06.593 --> 01:32:08.904
<v Josh Sparkes>functions as well,
we we've got skill sets.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/407-2
01:32:08.904 --> 01:32:13.053
<v Josh Sparkes>You don't kind of break it by skills
because it might be lots of time upfront,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/407-3
01:32:13.053 --> 01:32:16.572
<v Josh Sparkes>but you can just do it basically.
But I've got these on the faces.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/407-4
01:32:16.572 --> 01:32:20.563
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm sure it's like all these faces.
So basically that I just started, yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/408-0
01:32:21.843 --> 01:32:25.553
<v Josh Sparkes>I know that as you can't think Mr Joe's
Convention. Yeah. What's that?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/408-1
01:32:25.553 --> 01:32:29.419
<v Josh Sparkes>But think about skills. Capacity.
What's coming in the future as you talk</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/408-2
01:32:29.419 --> 01:32:32.867
<v Josh Sparkes>about huge planning as well.
You start to build that that sort of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/408-3
01:32:32.867 --> 01:32:35.532
<v Josh Sparkes>mechanism.
So do you guys have skills matrices and</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/408-4
01:32:35.532 --> 01:32:37.203
<v Josh Sparkes>please do you use them just now?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/409-0
01:32:37.603 --> 01:32:41.843
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, we do. So we could share that. Yeah,
that'd be great. Yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/410-0
01:32:43.923 --> 01:32:44.763
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's good.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/411-0
01:32:47.323 --> 01:32:51.505
<v Josh Sparkes>I've seen this word come up a few times.
So you when we were sort of electronic</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/411-1
01:32:51.505 --> 01:32:55.634
<v Josh Sparkes>payments coming in by both bank cheque
but you know do you receive payments in</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/411-2
01:32:55.634 --> 01:32:59.554
<v Josh Sparkes>any other way that's sort of there's a
theme that runs through some of the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/411-3
01:32:59.554 --> 01:33:02.167
<v Josh Sparkes>processes.
But we've done something happy path of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/411-4
01:33:02.167 --> 01:33:05.146
<v Josh Sparkes>the money flow.
It's lovely to the bank account that you</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/411-5
01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:06.923
<v Josh Sparkes>can receive money apart from cash.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/412-0
01:33:09.243 --> 01:33:12.731
<v Josh Sparkes>There might be other mechanisms that you
need it.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/412-1
01:33:12.731 --> 01:33:16.706
<v Josh Sparkes>I have not seen a check payment in
Australia in a while.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/412-2
01:33:16.706 --> 01:33:21.449
<v Josh Sparkes>We've been close to 12 months,
but it's not to say we don't receive</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/412-3
01:33:21.449 --> 01:33:22.843
<v Josh Sparkes>check payments that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/413-0
01:33:24.403 --> 01:33:28.775
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that bank cheque?
I think that might be outgoing funds</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/413-1
01:33:28.775 --> 01:33:29.603
<v Josh Sparkes>though, OK.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/414-0
01:33:31.683 --> 01:33:35.003
<v Josh Sparkes>That might be outgoing. OK, incoming not.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/415-0
01:33:36.603 --> 01:33:38.963
<v Josh Sparkes>The incoming the cheques was that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/416-0
01:33:43.123 --> 01:33:47.722
<v Josh Sparkes>And I'll charge that one for you.
Thanks again for money kind of decline</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/416-1
01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:52.824
<v Josh Sparkes>account. We only get it by bank transfer.
We do sometimes get cheques for office</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/416-2
01:33:52.824 --> 01:33:56.352
<v Josh Sparkes>account stuff,
but that's not what we're covering right</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/416-3
01:33:56.352 --> 01:33:56.603
<v Josh Sparkes>now.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/417-0
01:33:57.443 --> 01:34:01.813
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's office for us, too. Oh, OK. Yeah.
Sorry. Close. Always.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/417-1
01:34:01.813 --> 01:34:06.855
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't accept it's cash and you know,
for client investor. So. No. Yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/417-2
01:34:06.855 --> 01:34:11.963
<v Josh Sparkes>that would be great. OK, that's good.
So that might that's just for office.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/418-0
01:34:12.923 --> 01:34:17.731
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
clients will then cheques the payment of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/418-1
01:34:17.731 --> 01:34:24.379
<v Josh Sparkes>invoices on the occasion.
Let me have a look that's still on all</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/418-2
01:34:24.379 --> 01:34:27.243
<v Josh Sparkes>client and trust management.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/419-0
01:34:27.883 --> 01:34:30.563
<v Josh Sparkes>Transfer. Talk about this evening.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/420-0
01:34:33.203 --> 01:34:38.073
<v Josh Sparkes>Ledger statement.
They didn't because it's all up a couple</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/420-1
01:34:38.073 --> 01:34:42.035
<v Josh Sparkes>of them.
I think we've covered the overall path</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/420-2
01:34:42.035 --> 01:34:45.749
<v Josh Sparkes>right.
They've got the request coming in the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/420-3
01:34:45.749 --> 01:34:50.123
<v Josh Sparkes>whip with auto,
fine to working on it in checklists.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/421-0
01:34:50.603 --> 01:34:55.858
<v Josh Sparkes>The amounts and maybe the changing amount,
whichever way small commentary the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/421-1
01:34:55.858 --> 01:35:01.450
<v Josh Sparkes>receipt that's actually been received and
that PDF and supporting evidence of that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/421-2
01:35:01.450 --> 01:35:06.839
<v Josh Sparkes>and then close and at that point again
notifications can go back to the request</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/421-3
01:35:06.839 --> 01:35:07.243
<v Josh Sparkes>there.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/422-0
01:35:08.403 --> 01:35:12.610
<v Josh Sparkes>To say on those dashboards say that this
has been completed.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/422-1
01:35:12.610 --> 01:35:18.266
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there any other half that need to be
complete or is that considered then done?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/422-2
01:35:18.266 --> 01:35:22.197
<v Josh Sparkes>That's yeah, yeah.
That's the side of things. As I said,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/422-3
01:35:22.197 --> 01:35:26.403
<v Josh Sparkes>if someone has to pass for an interest
account, we wouldn't.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/423-0
01:35:26.883 --> 01:35:30.596
<v Josh Sparkes>On the back of that,
go and do that off our own steam.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/423-1
01:35:30.596 --> 01:35:35.051
<v Josh Sparkes>We wouldn't need any more involvement
from the from the fairness.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/423-2
01:35:35.051 --> 01:35:39.101
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know if how we track that the
system, I don't know.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/423-3
01:35:39.101 --> 01:35:44.163
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just thinking on the back of that,
maybe the task of interest account.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/424-0
01:35:44.443 --> 01:35:48.042
<v Josh Sparkes>Opened, yeah, that we can generate.
So a part of your workflow,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/424-1
01:35:48.042 --> 01:35:51.303
<v Josh Sparkes>although you wouldn't see it that you
could be triggered,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/424-2
01:35:51.303 --> 01:35:55.577
<v Josh Sparkes>interest account opens and then whatever
cheques that so you would open it,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/424-3
01:35:55.577 --> 01:35:59.175
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you wouldn't capture them.
The details of that account,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/424-4
01:35:59.175 --> 01:36:02.268
<v Josh Sparkes>they're probably housing degree,
is that correct? Yes,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/424-5
01:36:02.268 --> 01:36:04.123
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not a physical bank account.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/425-0
01:36:04.283 --> 01:36:08.516
<v Josh Sparkes>Of course, an account number. Anyway,
it's kind of like a virtual type account.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/425-1
01:36:08.516 --> 01:36:10.896
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah,
and then you could do the accounts,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/425-2
01:36:10.896 --> 01:36:14.388
<v Josh Sparkes>you have the naming convention.
I don't know if you capture that,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/425-3
01:36:14.388 --> 01:36:18.409
<v Josh Sparkes>but again, we probably have that.
But you could say interest account opened</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/425-4
01:36:18.409 --> 01:36:20.842
<v Josh Sparkes>when when it's open.
So for all the purposes,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/425-5
01:36:20.842 --> 01:36:23.963
<v Josh Sparkes>what kind of information do they need to
know? But it was.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/426-0
01:36:25.283 --> 01:36:29.585
<v Josh Sparkes>The state it's opens its jurisdiction or
where it's open we would we would always</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/426-1
01:36:29.585 --> 01:36:33.257
<v Josh Sparkes>open it same day if possible,
but our banking system cuts off at 4:00</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/426-2
01:36:33.257 --> 01:36:35.827
<v Josh Sparkes>PM. OK.
So if the money was generated after that</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/426-3
01:36:35.827 --> 01:36:38.240
<v Josh Sparkes>time,
we would just open the account the next</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/426-4
01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:41.807
<v Josh Sparkes>day instead. OK. Well, yeah,
it's always going to be done within 24</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/426-5
01:36:41.807 --> 01:36:42.803
<v Josh Sparkes>hours, essentially.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/427-0
01:36:44.123 --> 01:36:48.558
<v Josh Sparkes>Any other details that you need on it,
why it's held or currency or the fact</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/427-1
01:36:48.558 --> 01:36:53.337
<v Josh Sparkes>that it's open and then and then you go
through the post complete, can any? Sorry,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/427-2
01:36:53.337 --> 01:36:56.447
<v Josh Sparkes>Anna. Sorry, Josh,
you go just to wrap up that point.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/427-3
01:36:56.447 --> 01:37:00.190
<v Josh Sparkes>Can that go to anybody in the in your
team to open the interest,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/427-4
01:37:00.190 --> 01:37:02.723
<v Josh Sparkes>has it hasn't got to be the person when
we?</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/428-0
01:37:03.363 --> 01:37:08.431
<v Josh Sparkes>Anybody in the team can set it up,
but it then has to go to someone in the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/428-1
01:37:08.431 --> 01:37:12.756
<v Josh Sparkes>team to authorise it.
Anybody in the team that does that and so</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/428-2
01:37:12.756 --> 01:37:17.689
<v Josh Sparkes>we want to make sure we're not moving
along and the naming convention of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/428-3
01:37:17.689 --> 01:37:21.946
<v Josh Sparkes>Dickens all correct.
So needs organisation approval processing</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/428-4
01:37:21.946 --> 01:37:22.283
<v Josh Sparkes>that.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/429-0
01:37:22.963 --> 01:37:26.899
<v Josh Sparkes>An official or a paycheck?
Do they just look at it and say it's</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/429-1
01:37:26.899 --> 01:37:32.065
<v Josh Sparkes>official on the banking platform? So what?
It's 2 users have to do something in the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/429-2
01:37:32.065 --> 01:37:35.816
<v Josh Sparkes>bank. One person creates,
one person approves on the banking</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/429-3
01:37:35.816 --> 01:37:40.183
<v Josh Sparkes>platform. On that side. Yeah. OK.
I'm just thinking in service now you</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/429-4
01:37:40.183 --> 01:37:41.043
<v Josh Sparkes>would capture.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/430-0
01:37:41.363 --> 01:37:45.896
<v Josh Sparkes>Those two approvals potentially, yeah,
we can say do one approval,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/430-1
01:37:45.896 --> 01:37:51.038
<v Josh Sparkes>two start from the process for the two
approvals and you could get physical</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/430-2
01:37:51.038 --> 01:37:56.585
<v Josh Sparkes>names of its people that audit trail if
if you want to do it there or there, yes,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/430-3
01:37:56.585 --> 01:37:56.923
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/431-0
01:37:57.643 --> 01:38:02.519
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, it's better there. Yeah. Thank.
Thank you. Anna. Yeah. Sorry.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/431-1
01:38:02.519 --> 01:38:05.991
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia is a little bit different.
We can't.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/431-2
01:38:05.991 --> 01:38:11.680
<v Josh Sparkes>You're gonna hear that a lot today.
We can't open big CMA accounts ourselves</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/431-3
01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:14.043
<v Josh Sparkes>on our banking platform we have.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/432-0
01:38:14.443 --> 01:38:19.138
<v Josh Sparkes>To send a form off to ANZ,
which at that bank to do it so the client</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/432-1
01:38:19.138 --> 01:38:24.650
<v Josh Sparkes>has to complete a form themselves for us
with client information and so that has</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/432-2
01:38:24.650 --> 01:38:28.324
<v Josh Sparkes>to that form.
This is why generally the partners will</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/432-3
01:38:28.324 --> 01:38:33.495
<v Josh Sparkes>then instigate whether the CMA is
appropriate for the client or not because</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/432-4
01:38:33.495 --> 01:38:34.243
<v Josh Sparkes>we provide.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/433-0
01:38:34.323 --> 01:38:38.927
<v Josh Sparkes>Provide a form to the partner.
Partner then provides the form to the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/433-1
01:38:38.927 --> 01:38:43.663
<v Josh Sparkes>client. Client sends us this form back,
which is a bank specific form.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/433-2
01:38:43.663 --> 01:38:46.865
<v Josh Sparkes>We send that off to the bank bank and say
yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/433-3
01:38:46.865 --> 01:38:51.068
<v Josh Sparkes>a bank will come back and today an
account's ready to be open,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/433-4
01:38:51.068 --> 01:38:53.603
<v Josh Sparkes>but we need a signature signatures to.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/434-0
01:38:54.003 --> 01:38:57.241
<v Josh Sparkes>Open that for you.
So there's Jill two signatures authorised</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/434-1
01:38:57.241 --> 01:39:00.106
<v Josh Sparkes>by ANZ. They'll have to sign this form,
send it back,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/434-2
01:39:00.106 --> 01:39:01.963
<v Josh Sparkes>and then the CMA will be open then.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/435-0
01:39:04.923 --> 01:39:08.481
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's useful,
but the fact that maybe you still got the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/435-1
01:39:08.481 --> 01:39:12.737
<v Josh Sparkes>same workflow that interest accounts or
these accounts are being opened,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/435-2
01:39:12.737 --> 01:39:17.286
<v Josh Sparkes>your process is slightly differently,
but it's still a state that needs to go</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/435-3
01:39:17.286 --> 01:39:20.026
<v Josh Sparkes>through.
That's part you see for all wise it's</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/435-4
01:39:20.026 --> 01:39:22.883
<v Josh Sparkes>been and it's been completed or set up
and then.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/436-0
01:39:23.003 --> 01:39:26.132
<v Josh Sparkes>Closed.
You're capturing the activity even though</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/436-1
01:39:26.132 --> 01:39:31.261
<v Josh Sparkes>the details of which you know you capture
partners seeing form the approvals have</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/436-2
01:39:31.261 --> 01:39:35.891
<v Josh Sparkes>been done instead of you know received.
So you've got a different sort of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/436-3
01:39:35.891 --> 01:39:41.083
<v Josh Sparkes>checklist you have got the two approvals,
you've got a different set of checklist.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/437-0
01:39:41.443 --> 01:39:46.813
<v Josh Sparkes>That can be completed and do you think
that's the place to to do it or yes. Yeah,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/437-1
01:39:46.813 --> 01:39:50.153
<v Josh Sparkes>that's it.
So you notice the workflow state is the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/437-2
01:39:50.153 --> 01:39:53.034
<v Josh Sparkes>same,
your details of which because of your</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/437-3
01:39:53.034 --> 01:39:56.963
<v Josh Sparkes>location big can be entity differently to
approve as yours.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/438-0
01:39:57.803 --> 01:40:02.468
<v Josh Sparkes>The fact that you've got this workflow
that's done not by your team but outside</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/438-1
01:40:02.468 --> 01:40:06.083
<v Josh Sparkes>of outside of your team because they're
capturing that, yeah.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/439-0
01:40:07.403 --> 01:40:09.443
<v Josh Sparkes>Spacements cool. Yep, got it.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/440-0
01:40:13.003 --> 01:40:15.800
<v Josh Sparkes>So no.
And then when you close close the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/440-1
01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:20.438
<v Josh Sparkes>translation, no approval is required.
There's no poundage you said,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/440-2
01:40:20.438 --> 01:40:24.326
<v Josh Sparkes>or 2 million or 20 million.
It is just money to receive.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/440-3
01:40:24.326 --> 01:40:29.714
<v Josh Sparkes>There's no live cheques or peer reviews
that you doubled for the view that the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/440-4
01:40:29.714 --> 01:40:30.123
<v Josh Sparkes>money.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/441-0
01:40:30.763 --> 01:40:34.399
<v Josh Sparkes>Is like it said it is.
Is that in place or is it just the person</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/441-1
01:40:34.399 --> 01:40:38.258
<v Josh Sparkes>that's doing the the cheques?
Then just closing the request when the</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/441-2
01:40:38.258 --> 01:40:41.278
<v Josh Sparkes>money has second?
Obviously we check it matches all a</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/441-3
01:40:41.278 --> 01:40:44.074
<v Josh Sparkes>different.
We've been told we have been posted to</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/441-4
01:40:44.074 --> 01:40:46.983
<v Josh Sparkes>the system.
My team does a peer check at the end of</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/441-5
01:40:46.983 --> 01:40:49.443
<v Josh Sparkes>the day.
It's like a report that we do and.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/442-0
01:40:50.043 --> 01:40:52.670
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably put on a more MPL was a separate
task,</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/442-1
01:40:52.670 --> 01:40:56.775
<v Josh Sparkes>so we run the boards from three and
statements from the bank and make sure</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/442-2
01:40:56.775 --> 01:41:01.207
<v Josh Sparkes>that some balances off and some reviews
to make sure everything's been posted to</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/442-3
01:41:01.207 --> 01:41:04.655
<v Josh Sparkes>the connected place,
and I'm wondering about the bulk activity</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/9-0
01:41:01.342 --> 01:41:04.846
<v Josh Sparkes>Those details are posted to take the
place well. I'm wondering.</v>

717f45a5-36f1-42d3-b658-d9ff9a3a280c/442-4
01:41:04.655 --> 01:41:08.923
<v Josh Sparkes>you could do at the end of the day in
service now that they've been reviewed.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/9-1
01:41:04.846 --> 01:41:08.624
<v Josh Sparkes>That's the bulk activity you do at the
end of the day in ServiceNow,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/9-2
01:41:08.624 --> 01:41:12.841
<v Josh Sparkes>but they've been reviewed, you know,
reviews reviewed, close complete. Yeah,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/9-3
01:41:12.841 --> 01:41:15.743
<v Josh Sparkes>it's and share.
We would have been boxes been called</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/9-4
01:41:15.743 --> 01:41:19.302
<v Josh Sparkes>scheduled requests and almost someone
almost acts as a reminder.</v>
