<v Mark Sedge>Did it go? I was going to say,
did it make up for the rugby?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/127-0
00:01:38.323 --> 00:01:42.564
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Oh,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/145-0
00:01:56.203 --> 00:01:56.763
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I know.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/155-0
00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.059
OK. Shall we? Shall we get started so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/146-0
00:01:57.763 --> 00:01:57.883
<v Pearson, Raymond>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/165-0
00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:05.499
Yes, Programme Facilities Workshop today,
thanks for coming down.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/168-0
00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.619
Agenda.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/209-0
00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.040
Let's see if we take this this long.
We've we've already pre prepared for what

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/209-1
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.179
we think might be a great.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/210-0
00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.619
Solution.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/211-0
00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:19.019
And we'll walk through that.
We just want to kind of clarify what we

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/211-1
00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.419
believe is the as is processes for today,
the main reactive and PPM.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/239-0
00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.975
Processes that you follow because that's
feeding into what our solutions are,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/239-1
00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:30.831
but the point of this is that we can
adjust that as we go.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/239-2
00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:33.639
Let us know what you think on solutions
and we can tweak.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/272-0
00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.158
We'll have a break in the middle there,
11:15 to 11:45.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/272-1
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:41.150
I think we might finish probably probably
a bit earlier.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/272-2
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.299
So if we don't stretch that pretty late,
then it's 2:00 so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/299-0
00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:45.839
Call me a bit earlier.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/300-0
00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.808
We'll do some intros. That's OK.
So my name's Josh Sparks from TQ.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/300-1
00:02:50.808 --> 00:02:53.799

end.

<v Pearson, Raymond>ESM programme.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/514-0
00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:52.119
Right.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/513-0
00:04:52.049 --> 00:04:52.449
Laura.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/517-0
00:04:53.283 --> 00:04:56.626
<v Gonzalez, Laura>Yeah, I'm Laura. I'm from Deloitte.
I'm based in London and I'm here as</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/517-1
00:04:56.626 --> 00:04:59.643
<v Gonzalez, Laura>project track and support helping Jovana,
the programme manager.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/527-0
00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.669
Thanks, Laura. I think that's everyone.
Shout if if I haven't mentioned you.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/578-0
00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:07.319
I will call today or.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/536-0
00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:07.849
Yes.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/579-0
00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:11.839
We are recording Norma.
If you see there is a recording bot as

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/579-1
00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:14.725
well,
just like transcription and summaries.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/579-2
00:05:14.725 --> 00:05:19.984
Pretty good actually. Quite quite impress.
OK, thanks everyone. That's all clear.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/579-3
00:05:19.984 --> 00:05:23.639
Let's, let's get into it.
So this is the overall vision.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/619-0
00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:26.816
For the ESM programme,
not sure if I presented this last time,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/619-1
00:05:26.816 --> 00:05:30.207
but this is just a view of the ServiceNow
implementation. Part of the programme.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/619-2
00:05:30.207 --> 00:05:33.138
Some of the metrics on the left are the
reasons why we're doing this.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/619-3
00:05:33.138 --> 00:05:35.859
Some of the numbers that we're trying to
achieve as part of the.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/667-0
00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:40.250
The programme and on the right we're we
just basically explaining this is where

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/667-1
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.541
queries and requests can come in the top.
These are type of queries that we get

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/667-2
00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:48.617
across the board across ask an IT
facilities beneath that that layer is the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/667-3
00:05:48.617 --> 00:05:52.479
different channels that people can can
make those requests and queries.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/707-0
00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:56.798
At the moment,
mainly telephony calling up emails and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/707-1
00:05:56.798 --> 00:06:01.057
walk up in some areas,
what we focus on Phase 1 is this employee

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/707-2
00:06:01.057 --> 00:06:04.203
centre.
So that's a portal where employees will

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/707-3
00:06:04.203 --> 00:06:05.579
be able to to go and.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/708-0
00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:06.219
Make.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/709-0
00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.939
Requests.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/761-0
00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:12.931
The status of their requests and queries.
See communicate with with operations on

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/761-1
00:06:12.931 --> 00:06:16.119
their,
their tickets and various other things.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/761-2
00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:20.392
Links to other areas.
But we'll show you that when we get into

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/761-3
00:06:20.392 --> 00:06:23.240
it,
the other areas there that are are in

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/761-4
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.089
black, so the the AI bit, the chat mobile.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/783-0
00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:29.340
They're not part of this phase,
but they could come in future,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/783-1
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.092
so some quite exciting things that
ServiceNow can do in terms of their

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/783-2
00:06:32.092 --> 00:06:33.099
channels for reaching out.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/805-0
00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:38.952
The orangey layer going to bent to
represent most of the functions in in

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/805-1
00:06:38.952 --> 00:06:41.619
scope,
so it's it's quite a broad implementation,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/805-2
00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:42.099
so we're.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/850-0
00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:46.423
PSM so we put all together enterprise
service management since he's been been a

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/850-1
00:06:46.423 --> 00:06:49.821
part of that. So it's all together,
we get a lot of efficiencies because

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/850-2
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:50.659
we're all working.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/851-0
00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:51.299
There's one.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/852-0
00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:54.807
And at the bottom just some of the
technical bits that ServiceNow has,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/852-1
00:06:54.807 --> 00:06:57.179
so it's able to integrate out to other
systems.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/896-0
00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:02.583
Various capabilities I say we're going to
focus on employee, centre,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/896-1
00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:07.132
but we'll look at what it can do with
automation of workflows and making things

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/896-2
00:07:07.132 --> 00:07:11.795
simpler for for use saving time when when
executing upon things we'll also show a

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/896-3
00:07:11.795 --> 00:07:13.899
bit of the mobile capability as well.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/902-0
00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:17.959
I covers that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/917-0
00:07:17.609 --> 00:07:20.969
Mobile won't be available for a phase one.
Will that? Or does that change?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/935-0
00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:24.260
Not the not. Not the native app,
but the the web app URL. Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/929-0
00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:23.869
I would like you can.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/935-1
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.249
So there's a there's a native app and a
web.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/961-0
00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:31.624
Yeah, URL.
So if you mobile optimise I'll show you

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/961-1
00:07:31.624 --> 00:07:31.899
that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/962-0
00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:33.899
Josh, any chance you can make this?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/963-0
00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:34.299
A bit bigger.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/964-0
00:07:34.299 --> 00:07:35.779
Just got that chat bar down the side.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/969-0
00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:37.819
Oh, I see.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/974-0
00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:40.539
If you can't, don't worry,
it's just I'm struggling.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/994-0
00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:43.059
Fuzzy.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/995-0
00:07:43.859 --> 00:07:45.219
It's I think that's a room thing.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/996-0
00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:48.219
That room thing is OK? Yeah, that works.
Don't worry.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/992-0
00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:47.649
It's done on here.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1005-0
00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.649
Mess around with the breaks in. No,
I'm just intrigued.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1011-0
00:07:57.489 --> 00:07:57.889
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1076-0
00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:03.164
Some principles just for today,
if we can all stay, stay present.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1076-1
00:08:03.164 --> 00:08:05.690
It's it's not going to be too long a
meeting.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1076-2
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.644
So we'll get you back to your to your day
jobs when? As soon as we can.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1076-3
00:08:09.644 --> 00:08:13.213
One conversation at a time.
So when the guys on the phone speak,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1076-4
00:08:13.213 --> 00:08:17.332
it's quite it's quite loud so it'll
overpower and will if there's a bit of

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1076-5
00:08:17.332 --> 00:08:19.419
lag, we'll just try and manage it and.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1123-0
00:08:19.769 --> 00:08:22.982
Conversation.
We've got a break built in fourth one

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1123-1
00:08:22.982 --> 00:08:27.491
down concept of a parking lot is
basically when when we're going through

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1123-2
00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:30.889
what we need to focus on today,
if something comes up.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1124-0
00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:31.529
That's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1125-0
00:08:31.809 --> 00:08:34.945
Not needed right now be something we
could take away and come back to later.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1125-1
00:08:34.945 --> 00:08:36.289
We'll say put on the parking lot.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1149-0
00:08:36.859 --> 00:08:39.287
Then we'll address that at a later later
date if needed.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1149-1
00:08:39.287 --> 00:08:42.226
Or maybe it's for another team,
something like that just keeps us on

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1149-2
00:08:42.226 --> 00:08:43.419
track with what's important.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1205-0
00:08:45.739 --> 00:08:49.640
Yeah, moving towards decisions.
So we've already kind of prepared a few

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1205-1
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.108
solutions for today.
So if we're able to make decisions, great,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1205-2
00:08:53.108 --> 00:08:55.709
but there will be a subsequent section of
this,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1205-3
00:08:55.709 --> 00:08:59.882
this programme for facilities where we
will be sending through requirements,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1205-4
00:08:59.882 --> 00:09:03.512
user stories and then you'll be able to
see those and say yes, no,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1205-5
00:09:03.512 --> 00:09:04.379
you know change.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1220-0
00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:07.693
So it's it's not final decisions on
design,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1220-1
00:09:07.693 --> 00:09:11.059
but if we can make some decisions to move
forward towards that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1254-0
00:09:11.489 --> 00:09:15.905
Be good and we'll be capturing all
actions in Marlins got notes and we've

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1254-1
00:09:15.905 --> 00:09:20.739
got AI note takers and what not with all
the the magic of the Internet nowadays.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1254-2
00:09:20.739 --> 00:09:22.649
So don't don't worry about that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1273-0
00:09:24.239 --> 00:09:28.132
OK, So what we've done so far,
we've actually had quite a quite a lot of

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1273-1
00:09:28.132 --> 00:09:31.759
workshops across the the programme,
across all the different areas.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1290-0
00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:37.420
For facilities specifically,
we spoke was it was a couple of months

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1290-1
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.299
ago now, couple of months back.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1289-0
00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:40.069
Yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1329-0
00:09:41.059 --> 00:09:44.702
But that was that was a great, great call.
We we extracted what we understand is

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1329-1
00:09:44.702 --> 00:09:48.299
your as is process and we'll show you
that in a moment we'll just tidy up that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1330-0
00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:48.699
If anything.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1331-0
00:09:48.699 --> 00:09:52.562
'S a bit different and today, yes,
we'll do that validation.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1331-1
00:09:52.562 --> 00:09:54.019
Make sure that's right.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1378-0
00:09:54.739 --> 00:09:57.175
We'll look at the solutions we've we've
got in mind.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1378-1
00:09:57.175 --> 00:10:00.072
We've also extracted the data that you
guys use at the moment,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1378-2
00:10:00.072 --> 00:10:02.830
so categories and and types of issues and
things like that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1378-3
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.370
So it's just this is just an opportunity
to tie it up as well if you'd like.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1378-4
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.771
So we can have a quick glance at that,
but something you might want to do

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1378-5
00:10:09.771 --> 00:10:10.139
offline.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1431-0
00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:14.027
I am, yeah.
And then afterwards we'll get into that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1431-1
00:10:14.027 --> 00:10:16.862
design and we'll talk you through what
happens afterwards.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1431-2
00:10:16.862 --> 00:10:19.552
And then the stories and whatnot.
So we're mainly just,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1431-3
00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:23.347
let's validate that what we understand is
right, let's tidy up data if we can,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1431-4
00:10:23.347 --> 00:10:25.798
we take it away,
we can and then we'll look at the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1431-5
00:10:25.798 --> 00:10:29.689
solutions which will be the exciting bit
that Marvin's going to take us through.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1488-0
00:10:31.749 --> 00:10:35.559
It's we need to cover.
So on the left change roof.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1488-1
00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:37.949
Do you wanna explain the change?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1451-0
00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:38.239
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1489-0
00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:41.247
So I think some of you know me and some
of you don't.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1489-1
00:10:41.247 --> 00:10:45.160
So what I'm here to do is basically
understand what your current state is.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1489-2
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.230
And I from the workshops we've had,
we know there's a lot of frustrations and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1489-3
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.309
pain points and you're looking where
possible to digitise.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1533-0
00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:55.531
To solve those issues and we know what
our future state is,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1533-1
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:57.708
which Josh just talked through a moment
ago.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1533-2
00:10:57.708 --> 00:11:01.191
So that means there's a delta between the
current and the future state.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1533-3
00:11:01.191 --> 00:11:03.948
And what I'm here to do is actually
understand like, OK,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1533-4
00:11:03.948 --> 00:11:07.189
how do we support you and your teams and
the people you work with.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1586-0
00:11:07.979 --> 00:11:11.133
To to go through that delta and overcome
that hump of change.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1586-1
00:11:11.133 --> 00:11:14.745
So is it communications? Is it training,
is it stakeholder management?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1586-2
00:11:14.745 --> 00:11:18.661
Is it maybe working with the target
operating model team to say actually all

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1586-3
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:21.256
the comms in the world is not going to
solve this,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1586-4
00:11:21.256 --> 00:11:24.867
but we need to look at roles and
responsibilities because this doesn't

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1586-5
00:11:24.867 --> 00:11:26.139
actually sit in our team.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1588-0
00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:27.419
Is it?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1650-0
00:11:27.859 --> 00:11:31.467
The governance structure.
So in some of the IT sessions we had with

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1650-1
00:11:31.467 --> 00:11:34.863
Mark Zedge for instance,
it was like actually governance is the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1650-2
00:11:34.863 --> 00:11:38.736
issue. We know what our KPIs are,
but we're not really holding people to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1650-3
00:11:38.736 --> 00:11:42.981
account. So that's what I'm here to do.
So you'll hear me furiously typing away

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1650-4
00:11:42.981 --> 00:11:46.324
every now and again,
I might interject and ask a few follow-up

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1650-5
00:11:46.324 --> 00:11:48.499
questions, but generally you'll probably.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1653-0
00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:49.599
Keyboard more than me.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1699-0
00:11:51.099 --> 00:11:52.059
Sorry. Yeah, that's great.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1700-0
00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:55.867
Portal engagement.
So that's we're going to be looking at

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1700-1
00:11:55.867 --> 00:12:00.172
how are people engaging with us in the in
facilities portal in particular and what

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1700-2
00:12:00.172 --> 00:12:03.750
that looks like service design.
So So what happens when a service is

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1700-3
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.225
triggered with you guys,
the various types of services that are in

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1700-4
00:12:07.225 --> 00:12:07.899
the solution?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1750-0
00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:12.532
Because we can fire off tasks in
different areas, we can put in approvals.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1750-1
00:12:12.532 --> 00:12:14.909
So that's what that's talking about,
knowledge.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1750-2
00:12:14.909 --> 00:12:18.770
So that's what we don't want to come out.
I don't know if we spoke about this

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1750-3
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.384
before, if I captured actually,
but knowledge articles kind of things we

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1750-4
00:12:22.384 --> 00:12:26.048
can put in the portal to allow employees
to self to self help as it were.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1750-5
00:12:26.048 --> 00:12:26.939
So if there's any.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1754-0
00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:28.779
How to's for them?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1785-0
00:12:29.479 --> 00:12:33.799
But it's also things for operations in
the the back end usage of ServiceNow,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1785-1
00:12:33.799 --> 00:12:37.839
like what's called SOPS and stuff like
that. Service now can have that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1785-2
00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:41.879
So we would like to capture those as well
and we can move those across.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1786-0
00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:42.479
Part of it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1793-0
00:12:43.979 --> 00:12:45.219
Integrations I mentioned service.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1813-0
00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:50.950
Just have a breadth of already.
What do you call it out the box

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1813-1
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.286
integrations,
but it can do customs one as well custom

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1813-2
00:12:54.286 --> 00:12:54.589
ones.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1840-0
00:12:56.139 --> 00:12:59.125
Let's see, as we go through this,
if there's a if there's a need for it,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1840-1
00:12:59.125 --> 00:13:02.233
and if that can come into scope of the
projects in narrow in a later phase.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1840-2
00:13:02.233 --> 00:13:03.419
But that will be fleshed out.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1867-0
00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:08.979
Reports and dashboards we've we know
you've got some reports happening today.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1867-1
00:13:08.979 --> 00:13:11.588
Got those captured.
We've also got some suggestions.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1867-2
00:13:11.588 --> 00:13:15.625
The Marlins put together for future ones
that may be of interest to you guys that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1867-3
00:13:15.625 --> 00:13:16.019
will be.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1905-0
00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:18.839
Part of the the programme as well,
it's important for.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1906-0
00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:19.079
You.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1907-0
00:13:19.719 --> 00:13:22.198
And Slas as well.
So we spoke about that a bit before,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1907-1
00:13:22.198 --> 00:13:22.559
so we'll

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1908-0
00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:22.679
get.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1909-0
00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:26.794
Into that as well.
Hopefully we've kind of captured a lot of

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1909-1
00:13:26.794 --> 00:13:29.559
that in the as is and in the solution so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1914-0
00:13:31.229 --> 00:13:31.949
And get into it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1953-0
00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:35.627
In a moment. So yeah, we want to confirm.
We understand how you work,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1953-1
00:13:35.627 --> 00:13:39.691
get that right because that that makes
sure we can design right in the future

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1953-2
00:13:39.691 --> 00:13:43.182
going to design the formed meals.
Farm's going to take us do that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1953-3
00:13:43.182 --> 00:13:47.299
Those workflows that off the back of that
see if there's any integrations and.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1957-0
00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:48.899
Line of report requirements.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1962-0
00:13:49.789 --> 00:13:51.118
Again,
I've probably been to all those things

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1962-1
00:13:51.118 --> 00:13:51.349
already.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1986-0
00:13:52.859 --> 00:13:56.573
As is discovery,
so this is what we've extracted from that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1986-1
00:13:56.573 --> 00:14:00.601
conversation we had before.
I've put together a couple of rough

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/1986-2
00:14:00.601 --> 00:14:01.419
process maps.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2008-0
00:14:03.099 --> 00:14:07.369
As to the flow, as I understand it,
but we have in yellow is kind of where

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2008-1
00:14:07.369 --> 00:14:09.419
we've got a question if there's any.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2053-0
00:14:09.439 --> 00:14:12.369
Anything as I go through that isn't quite
right.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2053-1
00:14:12.369 --> 00:14:16.553
Please let us know and we'll subdate it.
But at the moment we've got.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2033-0
00:14:14.869 --> 00:14:15.029
So.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2053-2
00:14:16.553 --> 00:14:20.499
So this is a a reactive issue.
Something happens out of the blue,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2053-3
00:14:20.499 --> 00:14:25.521
it's unexpected employee reports an issue.
They can report either by if they report

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2053-4
00:14:25.521 --> 00:14:26.119
by e-mail.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2086-0
00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:30.213
To the mailbox or if they call in it
would go to ask connect.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2086-1
00:14:30.213 --> 00:14:32.672
Maybe let's just take that first route
first,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2086-2
00:14:32.672 --> 00:14:37.162
just to close that so they can go direct
or they do go direct to M&amp;E sometimes,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2086-3
00:14:37.162 --> 00:14:38.979
isn't that yeah, they can do that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2103-0
00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:43.109
Is that then picked up in a?
Is that captured in a ticket?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2103-1
00:14:43.109 --> 00:14:44.319
If they do that, if they go.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2148-0
00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.823
Quite often not.
If it just goes to a shared e-mail

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2148-1
00:14:48.823 --> 00:14:51.377
address,
so we can log it kind of retrospectively,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2115-0
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:50.429
Oh, all of them.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2148-2
00:14:51.377 --> 00:14:53.931
I guess,
just to capture that whether we should be

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2148-3
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:56.686
doing that or not,
I suppose is what the system should

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2148-4
00:14:56.686 --> 00:14:58.739
generate for us. But yeah, OK, yeah, all.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2149-0
00:14:59.059 --> 00:15:01.819
Right. Understood.
We'll look into that with solutions.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2155-0
00:15:02.859 --> 00:15:03.859
And when they e-mail.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2159-0
00:15:03.363 --> 00:15:07.867
<v Mark Sedge>Josh, can I? Sorry. Josh.
Can I just jump in and ask a quick</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2159-1
00:15:07.867 --> 00:15:11.706
<v Mark Sedge>question?
Are all of the contacts you have internal</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2159-2
00:15:11.706 --> 00:15:15.988
<v Mark Sedge>folks to Ashurst,
you've got no external folks contacting</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2159-3
00:15:15.988 --> 00:15:16.283
<v Mark Sedge>you?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2162-0
00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:18.759
No external.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2168-0
00:15:19.243 --> 00:15:23.158
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So it's all internal.
So it's the intention that the directive</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2168-1
00:15:23.158 --> 00:15:27.299
<v Mark Sedge>will be rather than do the e-mail that
they would engage via the portal,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2168-2
00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:30.930
<v Mark Sedge>is that the the type.
Therefore you get always get your tickets</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2168-3
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.163
<v Mark Sedge>as well as coming from actually by asking
this question.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2182-0
00:15:35.439 --> 00:15:36.996
Yeah,
ideally they should go for the portal.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2182-1
00:15:36.996 --> 00:15:37.999
Yeah, directly. Because then.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2177-0
00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:38.163
<v Mark Sedge>Perfect.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2183-0
00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:39.079
We don't, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2185-0
00:15:39.843 --> 00:15:41.163
<v Mark Sedge>OK. Thank you.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2187-0
00:15:40.109 --> 00:15:41.229
That's that's the aim.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2230-0
00:15:42.899 --> 00:15:46.968
OK. But at the moment,
if they e-mail the mailbox or call in,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2230-1
00:15:46.968 --> 00:15:51.759
it will land with connect as it stands
and then connects essentially are

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2230-2
00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:54.909
triaging,
logging a ticket and then you will if

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2230-3
00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:58.059
it's an M&amp;E item,
you'll log it to M&amp;E.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2236-0
00:15:59.339 --> 00:16:00.539
As a as a group.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2279-0
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:05.700
If it's so, do we share? We'll set up,
we can assign it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2279-1
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:11.508
So the way that we need to do it is just
kind of it's M and ES M and ES issue.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2279-2
00:16:11.508 --> 00:16:15.257
And then once we just save,
it disappears from it,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2279-3
00:16:15.257 --> 00:16:17.389
goes through to the engineer.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2280-0
00:16:17.669 --> 00:16:17.949
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2289-0
00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:22.259
Some maintenance of engine even. Oh OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2308-0
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:25.650
And then I've got here you'll also e-mail
them as well.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2308-1
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.669
Or is that that's when you save the
ticket that does it automatically?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2344-0
00:16:28.689 --> 00:16:31.299
Yes.
So we save the ticket and transfers

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2344-1
00:16:31.299 --> 00:16:35.754
through into the M and EQ.
So whoever's on that may not be available.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2344-2
00:16:35.754 --> 00:16:40.527
What the engineering supervisor.
So I was sitting the queue or to do until

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2344-3
00:16:40.527 --> 00:16:41.609
someone picks up.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2354-0
00:16:41.859 --> 00:16:44.079
Hello did you send a separate e-mail
though no or not. OK,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2354-1
00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:45.019
I know we got the e-mail.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2357-0
00:16:44.849 --> 00:16:45.569
The e-mail.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2366-0
00:16:46.469 --> 00:16:48.669
No, no, no. We just share the share we'll.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2365-0
00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:48.459
Seems log.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2367-0
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:49.549
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2417-0
00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:54.248
Right. And then, right,
so that e-mail bit I can take out of

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2417-1
00:16:54.248 --> 00:16:59.005
there and then Emily pick up self assign
the task when it lands in that queue and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2417-2
00:16:59.005 --> 00:17:02.717
then complete the task.
And I'm just being hidden over here and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2417-3
00:17:02.717 --> 00:17:05.966
then you go, oh, sorry,
I can't see that on this thing.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2417-4
00:17:05.966 --> 00:17:10.143
And then are you guys closing that ticket
then? Yeah, OK, cool. Got it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2417-5
00:17:10.143 --> 00:17:11.709
That's what I have as well.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2439-0
00:17:13.129 --> 00:17:19.191
If though it's a non M&amp;E task,
connect will e-mail cleaners, catering,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2439-1
00:17:19.191 --> 00:17:20.969
reception or security.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2449-0
00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:24.379
OK.
And they don't have access to show well?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2454-0
00:17:24.729 --> 00:17:24.809
No.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2455-0
00:17:25.129 --> 00:17:27.169
So essentially we're just closing the
ticket.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2465-0
00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:29.443
Oh,
so you close it straight away as soon as

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2465-1
00:17:29.443 --> 00:17:30.509
you e-mail it out and get it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2505-0
00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:33.329
OK, is is the intention that?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2476-0
00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:34.109
We're gonna keep.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2506-0
00:17:34.249 --> 00:17:38.653
Keep us connect as the triage between non
sharehold teams. Going forward.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2506-1
00:17:38.653 --> 00:17:41.272
We don't want them at any point in
service.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2506-2
00:17:41.272 --> 00:17:44.009
Now is like everyone in the system.
Ask nick.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2536-0
00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:51.857
Basically wish list I have requested
visibility for all teams, cleaners,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2536-1
00:17:51.857 --> 00:17:55.592
catering, reception,
AV and I'd like them to have full

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2525-0
00:17:53.163 --> 00:17:53.443
<v Mark Sedge>Yep.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2536-2
00:17:55.592 --> 00:17:56.339
visibility.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2544-0
00:17:57.939 --> 00:18:00.859
But not essentially.
They can do anything so they can see.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2570-0
00:18:01.769 --> 00:18:05.839
We've transferred over again.
I don't know what it looks like in terms

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2570-1
00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:09.049
of ServiceNow,
but that's like essentially A wish list.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2571-0
00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:09.889
We sent this e-mail.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2566-0
00:18:09.643 --> 00:18:09.883
<v Mark Sedge>Is.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2573-0
00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:15.563
<v Mark Sedge>Is there any reason why they wouldn't say
be?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2576-0
00:18:16.723 --> 00:18:21.320
<v Mark Sedge>Active on the system to close tickets
that you assigned to them so you can see</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2576-1
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.123
<v Mark Sedge>start finish of their activity.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2593-0
00:18:23.659 --> 00:18:24.099
Who did you?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2595-0
00:18:24.179 --> 00:18:27.130
Have share well,
so essentially all they would receive is

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2595-1
00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.859
an e-mail and their shared e-mail.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2600-0
00:18:28.403 --> 00:18:31.318
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
I think I think my point point is you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2600-1
00:18:31.318 --> 00:18:36.418
<v Mark Sedge>lose sight of it when it just you know
you have no idea when they've done it</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2600-2
00:18:36.418 --> 00:18:39.399
<v Mark Sedge>etcetera.
So in terms of management of those</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2600-3
00:18:39.399 --> 00:18:45.030
<v Mark Sedge>cleaners, caterers, those folk, you would,
the idea would be that we would want them</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2600-4
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.083
<v Mark Sedge>on the system. So that soon as.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2605-0
00:18:47.563 --> 00:18:50.582
<v Mark Sedge>You, Leanne,
you you sort of sent a task to them.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2605-1
00:18:50.582 --> 00:18:53.540
<v Mark Sedge>It's you.
You keep visibility of their activity.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2605-2
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:57.403
<v Mark Sedge>You know when they pick it up.
And you know when they close it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2635-0
00:18:58.049 --> 00:19:01.416
Yeah. So essentially,
I actually thought it was a share well,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2635-1
00:19:01.416 --> 00:19:05.000
was just like a like for like,
so who's on share? Well, just now,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2635-2
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.009
we'll be on ServiceNow in the future.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2642-0
00:19:08.579 --> 00:19:09.699
As essentially A wish list of.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2647-0
00:19:09.523 --> 00:19:11.980
<v Mark Sedge>But,
but the reason I'm calling it out is</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2647-1
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.490
<v Mark Sedge>because we might be able to say it might
be as it is today,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2647-2
00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:19.059
<v Mark Sedge>but we should be trying to get you to a
point of betterment,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2647-3
00:19:19.059 --> 00:19:22.393
<v Mark Sedge>right to enable you to be able to so it
it we should be.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2647-4
00:19:22.393 --> 00:19:25.669
<v Mark Sedge>We should be exploring the possibilities
and maybe Joe,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2647-5
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:28.243
<v Mark Sedge>I'm I'm sort of jumping ahead slightly
but.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2653-0
00:19:28.523 --> 00:19:31.257
<v Mark Sedge>We should explore the possibilities of
saying, well,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2653-1
00:19:31.257 --> 00:19:33.785
<v Mark Sedge>you know from for the benefit of the
enterprise,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2653-2
00:19:33.785 --> 00:19:37.757
<v Mark Sedge>wouldn't it be good if and then is that
something we want to do in a further</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2653-3
00:19:37.757 --> 00:19:41.316
<v Mark Sedge>phase or is that something the
organisation does or doesn't have the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2653-4
00:19:41.316 --> 00:19:43.844
<v Mark Sedge>appetite for?
We would probably need to park it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2653-5
00:19:43.844 --> 00:19:45.443
<v Mark Sedge>But I think there's some solid.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2659-0
00:19:46.083 --> 00:19:48.995
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
even even if there was just one or two of</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2659-1
00:19:48.995 --> 00:19:53.587
<v Mark Sedge>that community who were able to access
the system and close and acknowledge, say,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2659-2
00:19:53.587 --> 00:19:57.843
<v Mark Sedge>a supervisor or something like that,
who would at least close their tickets</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2659-3
00:19:57.843 --> 00:20:00.363
<v Mark Sedge>and things you could,
we could explore that.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2666-0
00:20:01.243 --> 00:20:03.843
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I think it how you go, Ruth.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2667-0
00:20:01.259 --> 00:20:03.059
So we say, oh, sorry Joe.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2695-0
00:20:04.619 --> 00:20:08.491
I'm just going to say just so that I'm
clear we saying for day one,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2695-1
00:20:08.491 --> 00:20:12.021
we want the approvers or the supervisors
to be in the system,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2695-2
00:20:12.021 --> 00:20:14.299
but everybody else in the future can be.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2702-0
00:20:14.323 --> 00:20:17.820
<v Mark Sedge>No, I'm.
I'm not saying anything for day one. One.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2698-0
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:18.309
Sorry.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2702-1
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.798
<v Mark Sedge>I'm just asking.
I'm what I'm asking the probably Joe and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2702-2
00:20:21.798 --> 00:20:27.215
<v Mark Sedge>the team is to just consider that the
tool has the capability to support these</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2702-3
00:20:27.215 --> 00:20:31.123
<v Mark Sedge>guys in terms of they just like any other
resolver team.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2708-0
00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:35.013
<v Mark Sedge>Would pick up action.
It's just a question of whether they want</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2708-1
00:20:35.013 --> 00:20:37.815
<v Mark Sedge>to. You know,
you want to do that and and the other</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2708-2
00:20:37.815 --> 00:20:42.127
<v Mark Sedge>point of reason why I'm not saying it's
an absolute is because you also need to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2708-3
00:20:42.127 --> 00:20:46.115
<v Mark Sedge>think about whether you've got any
contractual obligations where you know</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2708-4
00:20:46.115 --> 00:20:46.923
<v Mark Sedge>they would say.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2720-0
00:20:47.323 --> 00:20:51.390
<v Mark Sedge>You know, if if they're not contracted to,
then they won't and then you know that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2720-1
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:55.358
<v Mark Sedge>you need somebody else to do the check
because you don't want to just close the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2720-2
00:20:55.358 --> 00:20:57.690
<v Mark Sedge>ticket.
You want someone to make sure that the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2720-3
00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.914
<v Mark Sedge>task has been done right.
And then so someone needs to own it to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2720-4
00:21:00.914 --> 00:21:04.187
<v Mark Sedge>close it. If they don't do it.
If you think about completeness of</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2714-0
00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:03.083
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2718-0
00:21:02.919 --> 00:21:03.519
Just jumping.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2720-5
00:21:04.187 --> 00:21:04.683
<v Mark Sedge>operation.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2760-0
00:21:05.249 --> 00:21:08.774
And the money she was done before was
because the cleaners and catering all got

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2719-0
00:21:05.523 --> 00:21:05.843
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So. Umm.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2760-1
00:21:08.774 --> 00:21:12.212
mobiles and the show on welcome mobiles.
So we can run it out to anyone else.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2760-2
00:21:12.212 --> 00:21:15.208
So if we could get it to work but because
they don't sit at a desk,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2760-3
00:21:15.208 --> 00:21:18.249
they have to have their apps on the
phones. Obviously it won't work.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2758-0
00:21:18.683 --> 00:21:19.483
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2761-0
00:21:18.809 --> 00:21:18.969
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2768-0
00:21:20.043 --> 00:21:23.636
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>And I think from Leanne's point that
visibility is important,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2768-1
00:21:23.636 --> 00:21:28.040
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>especially if they're triaging those
requests and that's still the way that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2768-2
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:32.212
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>that's going to go going forward.
I think it's a decision that we can't</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2768-3
00:21:32.212 --> 00:21:36.095
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>make in this group though,
and it's probably not a day one because</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2765-0
00:21:35.363 --> 00:21:36.203
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, 100%.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2768-4
00:21:36.095 --> 00:21:39.803
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>we would be looking at like back end,
user access etcetera for.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2772-0
00:21:40.203 --> 00:21:45.077
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Cleaners, facilities, etcetera.
So I think it's something we just need to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2772-1
00:21:45.077 --> 00:21:46.723
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>log as a decision and we.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2777-0
00:21:47.563 --> 00:21:51.683
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So we park it,
we park it as something you might want to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2773-0
00:21:47.963 --> 00:21:49.283
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>See if ever go with that. Yep.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2777-1
00:21:51.683 --> 00:21:55.083
<v Mark Sedge>do strategically, but not right now. OK,
very good.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2775-0
00:21:53.363 --> 00:21:53.643
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2783-0
00:21:55.899 --> 00:21:57.779
Yep, that. Thanks. Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2825-0
00:21:57.259 --> 00:22:00.775
It's just before we move on,
maybe on simplifying a little bit,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2825-1
00:22:00.775 --> 00:22:05.061
but I understand getting them all in
phase one would probably be a hefty ask,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2825-2
00:22:05.061 --> 00:22:09.127
but if we service that has a lot of
standard reporting functionality that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2825-3
00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:11.819
structure we could even set up cleaner
specific.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2873-0
00:22:12.859 --> 00:22:15.475
Reports that have outstanding items and
send them out,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2873-1
00:22:15.475 --> 00:22:18.948
potentially on a weekly basis,
to specific user groups or certain e-mail

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2873-2
00:22:18.948 --> 00:22:21.326
addresses.
So essentially the cleaning supervisor

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2873-3
00:22:21.326 --> 00:22:24.894
could have these outstanding lists.
Please update me at the end of the day

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2873-4
00:22:24.894 --> 00:22:28.176
and just have that as a kind of
additional process to give them that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2873-5
00:22:28.176 --> 00:22:28.699
visibility.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2890-0
00:22:28.999 --> 00:22:30.844
With something like that optimised
process?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2890-1
00:22:30.844 --> 00:22:33.359
Or would it just be adding extra admin
for the second unit?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2925-0
00:22:32.809 --> 00:22:35.039
Yeah, because really,
they're getting a request.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2925-1
00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:36.769
It means it needs to be done urgently.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2903-0
00:22:37.019 --> 00:22:37.539
OK, fine.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2926-0
00:22:37.409 --> 00:22:40.447
Oh yes, normally they have to.
Then there and then there's a spill or

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2926-1
00:22:40.447 --> 00:22:41.489
something and they need.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2937-0
00:22:41.249 --> 00:22:44.982
So general assumptions is majority of the
items are typically like AP1 and it needs

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2937-1
00:22:44.982 --> 00:22:45.649
to be etcetera.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2941-0
00:22:46.043 --> 00:22:49.358
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah. And how do they let you know,
just know that it has been completed?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2941-1
00:22:49.358 --> 00:22:51.643
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Is that a phone call to you?
Just to let you know.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2985-0
00:22:53.749 --> 00:22:58.301
If it's eyes, if it's coming through eyes,
it's a gel. We just closed the ticket.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2950-0
00:22:57.643 --> 00:22:58.243
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Mm-hmm.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2985-1
00:22:58.301 --> 00:23:01.909
We don't need anything else from it
unless it's not. No, no, no.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2961-0
00:22:59.483 --> 00:23:01.883
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So you don't have any visibility at all,
OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2986-0
00:23:02.069 --> 00:23:04.309
So you don't keep it open to see it's
actually done as a.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2987-0
00:23:04.349 --> 00:23:07.357
Reminder, we'll send an e-mail.
So with share,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2971-0
00:23:04.723 --> 00:23:04.963
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/2987-1
00:23:07.357 --> 00:23:09.149
we'll only close the ticket.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3020-0
00:23:09.979 --> 00:23:15.462
The recipient can still reply back and we
would still create a response.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3020-1
00:23:15.462 --> 00:23:21.246
So at 9 times out of 10 we'll send it to
the cleaners. It gets done because,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3020-2
00:23:21.246 --> 00:23:23.499
as I say, it's a priority one.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3049-0
00:23:24.109 --> 00:23:28.069
And we don't have anything back.
We've never been on share well, so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3050-0
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.829
No, that's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3051-0
00:23:28.989 --> 00:23:31.149
Fine.
So the assumption as you send out it's

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3051-1
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.389
done.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3066-0
00:23:31.399 --> 00:23:33.537
Yes,
it's a good it's completed and our task

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3052-0
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:32.309
That's completely.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3041-0
00:23:31.843 --> 00:23:32.083
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3066-1
00:23:33.537 --> 00:23:37.479
has been completed and the next task is
on to the cleaners to complete their task.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3082-0
00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:41.109
And I'm assuming it's underpinned by the
contractor sensor. It's a case of.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3098-0
00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:44.886
Yes, yeah, there must be.
They must have some data somewhere along

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3098-1
00:23:44.886 --> 00:23:47.419
the way to see what they've done and.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3115-0
00:23:46.499 --> 00:23:48.400
Yeah, yeah, I'm busy.
It'll come back to me.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3115-1
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.935
It hadn't been done.
I'm pretty sure someone will be on the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3115-2
00:23:50.935 --> 00:23:53.259
phone to me pretty quickly,
saying that's still there.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3110-0
00:23:51.403 --> 00:23:52.603
<v Mark Sedge>So. So what?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3115-3
00:23:53.259 --> 00:23:54.019
So you still know.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3120-0
00:23:53.643 --> 00:23:56.492
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>That was that was going to be.
My next question was,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3114-0
00:23:54.723 --> 00:23:54.843
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3120-1
00:23:56.492 --> 00:24:00.307
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>so I take it we and you'll still feel
queries on that. So for example,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3120-2
00:24:00.307 --> 00:24:02.887
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>if the person that's raised the issue
into you,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3120-3
00:24:02.887 --> 00:24:05.950
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>you've sent the e-mail off to the
cleaners, for example,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3120-4
00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:09.443
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>you've got no sight of it,
but they haven't seen it being fixed.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3122-0
00:24:09.603 --> 00:24:12.363
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>They'll come back to you to raise that.
Would that be right?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3127-0
00:24:12.729 --> 00:24:14.889
Yes. And then we can follow up then.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3133-0
00:24:14.923 --> 00:24:17.713
<v Mark Sedge>So so, Tim,
that the risk there that you is you,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3133-1
00:24:17.713 --> 00:24:22.439
<v Mark Sedge>you get sort of follow on records if they
if they go for either portal they and it</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3133-2
00:24:22.439 --> 00:24:27.107
<v Mark Sedge>generates new ones and ultimately that's
failure demand stuff you have to work on</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3133-3
00:24:27.107 --> 00:24:30.523
<v Mark Sedge>because someone hasn't hasn't taken the
appropriate action.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3138-0
00:24:30.883 --> 00:24:35.327
<v Mark Sedge>The logic, the, the,
and good service discipline it would,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3138-1
00:24:35.327 --> 00:24:41.428
<v Mark Sedge>the idea would be you'd you'd keep the
task open until you had confirmation from</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3138-2
00:24:41.428 --> 00:24:46.323
<v Mark Sedge>the user or the requester that they were
happy with the outcome.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3145-0
00:24:46.683 --> 00:24:49.991
<v Mark Sedge>So and that way you you don't,
you don't need them to chase so good</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3145-1
00:24:49.991 --> 00:24:52.716
<v Mark Sedge>customer service.
So what would happen is you would you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3145-2
00:24:52.716 --> 00:24:56.656
<v Mark Sedge>know if you know it's going to be done in
that day what you might do out of you,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3145-3
00:24:56.656 --> 00:25:00.305
<v Mark Sedge>you'd have the record open and then at
the end say in a couple of hours or</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3145-4
00:25:00.305 --> 00:25:02.543
<v Mark Sedge>whatever your Slas with the cleaning
service,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3145-5
00:25:02.543 --> 00:25:06.483
<v Mark Sedge>you'd go back to them and say are you
happy, was it done? Yes, good you'd close.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3152-0
00:25:06.563 --> 00:25:11.310
<v Mark Sedge>That formally close it and then you know
that's been actioned rather than having a</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3152-1
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:15.771
<v Mark Sedge>closed task relying upon the customer
coming back to you to say actually they</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3152-2
00:25:15.771 --> 00:25:20.004
<v Mark Sedge>didn't turn up or they didn't do it.
So you just got to think about, yes,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3152-3
00:25:20.004 --> 00:25:23.264
<v Mark Sedge>it might be an administrative piece to
close the record,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3152-4
00:25:23.264 --> 00:25:26.123
<v Mark Sedge>but you reduce the risk of failure demand
coming.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3156-0
00:25:26.203 --> 00:25:31.075
<v Mark Sedge>Back in because you know your requester
wasn't satisfied with the outcome,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3156-1
00:25:31.075 --> 00:25:33.803
<v Mark Sedge>bless you, whoever that was, that sneezed.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3158-0
00:25:35.963 --> 00:25:37.123
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah. And I think from it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3161-0
00:25:36.123 --> 00:25:38.858
<v Mark Sedge>Does does that make sense? So,
so we ought to,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3161-1
00:25:38.858 --> 00:25:43.629
<v Mark Sedge>we ought to be working through to reduce
your failure demand and also improve the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3161-2
00:25:43.629 --> 00:25:45.723
<v Mark Sedge>service expectation of the customer.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3187-0
00:25:47.049 --> 00:25:49.311
Yeah,
I should probably just a process change

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3187-1
00:25:49.311 --> 00:25:53.197
for us then essentially we could just put
it into pending or whatever work and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3168-0
00:25:50.603 --> 00:25:50.763
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>It.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3181-0
00:25:53.083 --> 00:25:54.923
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah, yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3187-2
00:25:53.197 --> 00:25:56.049
we're going to use. Yeah. That's good.
Yeah, that's fine.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3179-0
00:25:53.323 --> 00:25:54.203
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3189-0
00:25:53.379 --> 00:25:53.579
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3195-0
00:25:56.363 --> 00:26:01.028
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>And we can help manage that, Leanne,
when we look at like Slas and Olas</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3195-1
00:26:01.028 --> 00:26:04.138
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>etcetera for our piece around when we
check in.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3195-2
00:26:04.138 --> 00:26:08.867
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So if we think about not having the
cleaners and others on the back end.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3195-3
00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:14.244
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So we can't have sight of it for day one.
But what we can actually do is make that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3195-4
00:26:14.244 --> 00:26:16.123
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>process change we are within.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3201-0
00:26:16.283 --> 00:26:18.631
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>X amount of errors or whatever your Slas
are,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3201-1
00:26:18.631 --> 00:26:22.409
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>we go back and check in if it's been done
and it's satisfactory etcetera.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3201-2
00:26:22.409 --> 00:26:26.186
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>And it helps us close that loop.
So that's something we can implement day</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3201-3
00:26:26.186 --> 00:26:29.709
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>one from our process side.
It's just we don't have sight and then in</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3199-0
00:26:27.883 --> 00:26:28.163
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3201-4
00:26:29.709 --> 00:26:33.843
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>a future stage the hope would be that we
would have sight of the back end teams.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3203-0
00:26:34.443 --> 00:26:35.923
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>And we can automate that, right?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3205-0
00:26:35.923 --> 00:26:37.523
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah, 100%, Joe.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3251-0
00:26:39.869 --> 00:26:40.229
Clear.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3214-0
00:26:40.169 --> 00:26:40.329
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3252-0
00:26:40.469 --> 00:26:44.466
What we've done for some of the other
areas just for reporting and disability

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3252-1
00:26:44.466 --> 00:26:47.900
is when you put something in pending or
if there's a state change,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3252-2
00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.821
we also have the option of having micro
drop down field.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3252-3
00:26:50.821 --> 00:26:54.869
So if you want to identify peenas were
not responding on time or they weren't.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3294-0
00:26:55.939 --> 00:26:59.256
The correct level of cleaning or whatever
your instance is, we can have those.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3294-1
00:26:59.256 --> 00:27:02.741
So when you do go into the reporting and
ServiceNow, you can pull that up and say,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3294-2
00:27:02.741 --> 00:27:04.462
OK,
these are with clear bottlenecks are

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3294-3
00:27:04.462 --> 00:27:07.317
these are where the gaps are.
So that is something we can do within

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3288-0
00:27:07.283 --> 00:27:07.403
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3294-4
00:27:07.317 --> 00:27:08.619
service hour. If you wanted to.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3301-0
00:27:08.723 --> 00:27:13.603
<v Mark Sedge>The the power to to to add to that also
you can have closure a type of closure</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3301-1
00:27:13.603 --> 00:27:16.754
<v Mark Sedge>category.
So you could say closed successfully you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3301-2
00:27:16.754 --> 00:27:21.943
<v Mark Sedge>know customer satisfied closed but had to
chase you know to get it done or you know</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3301-3
00:27:21.943 --> 00:27:24.908
<v Mark Sedge>closed incomplete you know whatever it
happens.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3301-4
00:27:24.908 --> 00:27:28.243
<v Mark Sedge>Do you know what I mean we can we can
look for stuff.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3307-0
00:27:28.443 --> 00:27:28.883
<v Mark Sedge>Meaningful.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3309-0
00:27:28.963 --> 00:27:32.702
<v Mark Sedge>Such that when you do a service review
with the cleaning staff,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3309-1
00:27:32.702 --> 00:27:37.492
<v Mark Sedge>if you're finding through that data that,
say 50% of the time you've had to chase</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3309-2
00:27:37.492 --> 00:27:42.457
<v Mark Sedge>them up or the customers had to, you know,
said that they weren't happy or it wasn't</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3309-3
00:27:42.457 --> 00:27:47.189
<v Mark Sedge>done right or whatever it happens to be,
it gives you the ability to manage your</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3309-4
00:27:47.189 --> 00:27:48.883
<v Mark Sedge>supplier through the closure.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3316-0
00:27:49.283 --> 00:27:52.535
<v Mark Sedge>Task resolution.
Now most of them hopefully will just be</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3316-1
00:27:52.535 --> 00:27:55.159
<v Mark Sedge>success.
You know customer happy successfully</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3316-2
00:27:55.159 --> 00:27:57.954
<v Mark Sedge>closed,
but you can build that out to enable you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3316-3
00:27:57.954 --> 00:28:02.574
<v Mark Sedge>to have some service data which either to
enhance and improve your you know your</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3316-4
00:28:02.574 --> 00:28:06.681
<v Mark Sedge>overall operation or more importantly to
make sure that those cleaners,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3316-5
00:28:06.681 --> 00:28:08.563
<v Mark Sedge>catering firms, you know support.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3317-0
00:28:08.763 --> 00:28:11.123
<v Mark Sedge>Et cetera. Our our performance.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3331-0
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.909
And we'll, we'll.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3332-0
00:28:14.909 --> 00:28:19.869
Look a bit closer at scenario we'll get
into solution reactive solution.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3333-0
00:28:20.043 --> 00:28:22.043
<v Mark Sedge>But you get the gist of what I'm
suggesting.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3368-0
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:27.694
OK,
the only thing on here that was still

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3368-1
00:28:27.694 --> 00:28:31.013
just to clarify, as we've said,
we'll look at it for later date,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3368-2
00:28:31.013 --> 00:28:34.026
but cleaners, was it cleaner skating,
reception, security.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3368-3
00:28:34.026 --> 00:28:37.549
The reason they didn't go on shows
because the mobiles, all of them.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3382-0
00:28:38.009 --> 00:28:41.342
In catering one day and reception and
security was reading for others quite a

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3382-1
00:28:41.342 --> 00:28:43.009
need for them to be on there to really.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3392-0
00:28:43.299 --> 00:28:43.659
OK, we'll.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3393-0
00:28:44.339 --> 00:28:47.619
Note that one for for that parking lot,
that's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3414-0
00:28:49.489 --> 00:28:49.529
K.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3415-0
00:28:50.289 --> 00:28:54.146
Clicks. I'm not gonna go through this.
It's just what we thought about.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3415-1
00:28:54.146 --> 00:28:56.289
That's fed into the the the process map.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3424-0
00:28:56.969 --> 00:29:00.929
This one around the PPM then so first
question.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3428-0
00:29:02.319 --> 00:29:02.919
2 loads.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3440-0
00:29:02.579 --> 00:29:07.059
As those tasks into PPM because they're a
bunch of scheduled tasks.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3442-0
00:29:07.099 --> 00:29:08.859
Yeah, I mean, I don't have that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3458-0
00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:15.349
Photography was initially loaded in to
show up, but it exists.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3470-0
00:29:16.019 --> 00:29:18.294
That's not where we pay for.
We pay for fee.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3471-0
00:29:18.219 --> 00:29:20.939
That's I think that's SFG 20.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3470-1
00:29:18.294 --> 00:29:19.659
Don't we want to hear that?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3511-0
00:29:22.659 --> 00:29:26.751
Which is the kind of like the industry
standard on how to undertake the task.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3511-1
00:29:26.751 --> 00:29:31.106
And I mean if that could be implemented
into the PPM shipping, that would be good,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3511-2
00:29:31.106 --> 00:29:33.099
but I don't know how the original PPF.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3519-0
00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:35.719
It's got uploaded into share. Well,
there must have.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3520-0
00:29:35.719 --> 00:29:35.919
Been a.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3524-0
00:29:36.629 --> 00:29:37.269
Stops.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3537-0
00:29:37.769 --> 00:29:39.967
Process sort of based on what the
requirements are,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3537-1
00:29:39.967 --> 00:29:42.249
what the plant and the asset is.
So I don't know how.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3543-0
00:29:42.719 --> 00:29:44.839
But is it edited regularly?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3542-0
00:29:43.883 --> 00:29:45.803
<v Mark Sedge>How do you track your assets, Ashley?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3548-0
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:51.349
What do you mean, Mark? Sorry.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3554-0
00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:54.266
<v Mark Sedge>So.
So just from from my experience the what</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3554-1
00:29:54.266 --> 00:29:58.836
<v Mark Sedge>we'd expect or what we would certainly
drive towards is you'd have say the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3554-2
00:29:58.836 --> 00:30:01.761
<v Mark Sedge>assets,
the key assets that you are maintaining</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3554-3
00:30:01.761 --> 00:30:06.941
<v Mark Sedge>you'd have in your configuration database.
Some of this is linked to a little bit of</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3554-4
00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:10.963
<v Mark Sedge>it, but it's enterprise assets.
So what you'd have is you'd have.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3563-0
00:30:11.083 --> 00:30:15.140
<v Mark Sedge>Your locations floors.
You might have your handling units.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3563-1
00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:19.265
<v Mark Sedge>You might have UPS's.
You might have these as key assets to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3558-0
00:30:16.689 --> 00:30:16.849
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3563-2
00:30:19.265 --> 00:30:22.015
<v Mark Sedge>your.
You know the office accommodation</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3563-3
00:30:22.015 --> 00:30:26.827
<v Mark Sedge>provision and what you'd have is you'd
have those assets in the CMDB,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3563-4
00:30:26.827 --> 00:30:30.883
<v Mark Sedge>and then what you would be able to do is
you'd be able to.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3571-0
00:30:30.923 --> 00:30:34.988
<v Mark Sedge>To schedule the maintenance,
you'd be able to see when that last asset</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3571-1
00:30:34.988 --> 00:30:37.966
<v Mark Sedge>was visited,
you know you'd you basically have your</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3571-2
00:30:37.966 --> 00:30:41.458
<v Mark Sedge>audit trail related to that.
So how's that done in Cherwell?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3568-0
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:39.229
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3571-3
00:30:41.458 --> 00:30:42.603
<v Mark Sedge>Or is it not at all?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3608-0
00:30:43.409 --> 00:30:47.497
I don't think it is, to be honest.
I mean at the moment even the the assets

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3608-1
00:30:47.497 --> 00:30:50.509
themselves are not easy to identify or
the task itself.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3586-0
00:30:49.883 --> 00:30:50.163
<v Mark Sedge>Wow.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3608-2
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:54.489
The abbreviations that we've got,
the guys have just become accustomed to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3608-3
00:30:54.489 --> 00:30:56.049
over a period of time really.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3605-0
00:30:56.363 --> 00:30:56.883
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3609-0
00:30:56.489 --> 00:30:56.769
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3622-0
00:30:57.619 --> 00:31:01.004
Becoming new into the system.
I'm still understanding what what these

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3622-1
00:31:01.004 --> 00:31:02.019
abbreviations are so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3635-0
00:31:03.739 --> 00:31:06.444
It needs to be more prescriptive and
easier to understand.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3635-1
00:31:06.444 --> 00:31:07.499
I think the new system.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3637-0
00:31:08.763 --> 00:31:09.723
<v Mark Sedge>Oh, OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3652-0
00:31:09.139 --> 00:31:11.628
But as you say, you know the asset,
the full asset list,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3652-1
00:31:11.628 --> 00:31:13.899
I've not even really seen that as part of
Churwell.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3658-0
00:31:14.243 --> 00:31:18.309
<v Mark Sedge>So so there's an opportunity and and
again this probably a question to the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3658-1
00:31:18.309 --> 00:31:22.266
<v Mark Sedge>wider room because the reason I ask that
question is also because IT are</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3658-2
00:31:22.266 --> 00:31:25.031
<v Mark Sedge>interested in some of that because if for
example,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3658-3
00:31:25.031 --> 00:31:28.934
<v Mark Sedge>you're maintaining an AC unit or
something in a tech room and therefore</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3658-4
00:31:28.934 --> 00:31:32.403
<v Mark Sedge>it's down for a period of time, you know,
IIT teams need to be.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3666-0
00:31:32.843 --> 00:31:36.996
<v Mark Sedge>Aware that potentially you might have,
you know overheating devices or they</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3666-1
00:31:36.996 --> 00:31:39.837
<v Mark Sedge>might have to put a temporary unit in to,
you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3666-2
00:31:39.837 --> 00:31:42.951
<v Mark Sedge>provide the cooling to enable you not to
over, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3666-3
00:31:42.951 --> 00:31:45.683
<v Mark Sedge>overdo your tech or if you're yeah,
I don't know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3666-4
00:31:45.683 --> 00:31:48.142
<v Mark Sedge>you might be looking at say a power
circuit,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3666-5
00:31:48.142 --> 00:31:52.403
<v Mark Sedge>you know or pat testing or some of those
types of things against a number of.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3673-0
00:31:52.443 --> 00:31:57.298
<v Mark Sedge>Assets on a building that may impact
power, therefore may impact IT.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3673-1
00:31:57.298 --> 00:32:01.871
<v Mark Sedge>So I think there's some,
there's some join up opportunity for us</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3673-2
00:32:01.871 --> 00:32:07.288
<v Mark Sedge>to maybe not for day one but overtime
fast follow from go live to say if you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3673-3
00:32:07.288 --> 00:32:12.283
<v Mark Sedge>started to work with the engineers to
identify what those assets were.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3680-0
00:32:12.683 --> 00:32:16.869
<v Mark Sedge>Where they were etcetera,
because we certainly would be interested</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3680-1
00:32:16.869 --> 00:32:20.367
<v Mark Sedge>in the raw location data,
meeting room data floor plan,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3680-2
00:32:20.367 --> 00:32:25.427
<v Mark Sedge>you know stuff we might be able to work
collectively to give you the facility to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3680-3
00:32:25.427 --> 00:32:30.299
<v Mark Sedge>actually have those assets in the CMDB,
which is the configuration management</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3680-4
00:32:30.299 --> 00:32:31.923
<v Mark Sedge>database from an IT angle.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3684-0
00:32:32.403 --> 00:32:36.447
<v Mark Sedge>Which gives you some opportunities to
leverage incidents against those requests</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3684-1
00:32:36.447 --> 00:32:39.581
<v Mark Sedge>against those maintenance schedules,
against those, etcetera,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3684-2
00:32:39.581 --> 00:32:41.603
<v Mark Sedge>something you might want to think about.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3697-0
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.669
Yeah, that makes.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3698-0
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:43.949
Sense we do that, but everything.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3699-0
00:32:43.949 --> 00:32:44.909
'S manual, isn't it? Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3700-0
00:32:45.099 --> 00:32:46.339
Where it's all in there.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3710-0
00:32:45.843 --> 00:32:47.990
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
the point the point here is that the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3703-0
00:32:47.929 --> 00:32:48.009
So.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3710-1
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.335
<v Mark Sedge>system will do it for you.
So when they say you've got maintenance</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3705-0
00:32:49.649 --> 00:32:49.809
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3710-2
00:32:51.335 --> 00:32:53.731
<v Mark Sedge>schedule on a, on a,
on a calendar opportunity,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3710-3
00:32:53.731 --> 00:32:57.525
<v Mark Sedge>what it will do is it'll automatically
flag that you can create the record,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3710-4
00:32:57.525 --> 00:33:00.720
<v Mark Sedge>it can link the record to the asset.
So you can on a dashboard,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3710-5
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.414
<v Mark Sedge>just look at your assets and see which
ones are currently in maintenance,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3710-6
00:33:04.414 --> 00:33:04.963
<v Mark Sedge>which ones.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3716-0
00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:07.529
<v Mark Sedge>Say you've got loads of incidents,
for example,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3716-1
00:33:07.529 --> 00:33:10.484
<v Mark Sedge>give you a real life example global bank
that worked out.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3716-2
00:33:10.484 --> 00:33:14.407
<v Mark Sedge>They often had consistent failures,
you know from an IT angle on their comms</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3716-3
00:33:14.407 --> 00:33:16.801
<v Mark Sedge>kit.
But the comms kit was in the basement and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3716-4
00:33:16.801 --> 00:33:20.317
<v Mark Sedge>the basement was flooding,
so the maintenance didn't pick up on that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3716-5
00:33:20.317 --> 00:33:24.443
<v Mark Sedge>even though they had maintenance visits.
But what you enables you to do is then.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3723-0
00:33:24.723 --> 00:33:28.180
<v Mark Sedge>Take some action to either move the care
or do some prevent.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3723-1
00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:31.523
<v Mark Sedge>You know it gives you that trending to be
able to operate.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3723-2
00:33:31.523 --> 00:33:36.000
<v Mark Sedge>So what what the tool will do is give you
the ability to automatically add the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3723-3
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.740
<v Mark Sedge>record and then when you say you create,
you get a new, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3723-4
00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.233
<v Mark Sedge>say you fire up a new new office
somewhere,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3723-5
00:33:42.233 --> 00:33:44.443
<v Mark Sedge>you'd have that location in the office.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3729-0
00:33:45.243 --> 00:33:49.774
<v Mark Sedge>If you set up meeting rooms or you had
certain floors that we were utilising,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3729-1
00:33:49.774 --> 00:33:54.364
<v Mark Sedge>you'd add those floors in if you had
certain you know power circuits that were</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3729-2
00:33:54.364 --> 00:33:58.024
<v Mark Sedge>for technical care against power circuits
for the other stuff,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3729-3
00:33:58.024 --> 00:34:01.683
<v Mark Sedge>you could record some of that information
that enables you to.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3736-0
00:34:01.963 --> 00:34:05.300
<v Mark Sedge>Be be able to maintain those kit or
maintain those systems.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3736-1
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:09.694
<v Mark Sedge>Certainly AC units in your in your floor
spaces or in your ceiling spaces is a</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3736-2
00:34:09.694 --> 00:34:12.419
<v Mark Sedge>classic.
You know you need to know that there'll</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3736-3
00:34:12.419 --> 00:34:15.757
<v Mark Sedge>be some disruption.
the IT team might need to take a device</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3736-4
00:34:15.757 --> 00:34:19.038
<v Mark Sedge>down say a printer,
move it so you can get to the you know</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3736-5
00:34:19.038 --> 00:34:21.763
<v Mark Sedge>it's all of that kind of stuff you can
build in.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3739-0
00:34:22.323 --> 00:34:25.407
<v Mark Sedge>If you're sort of mapping that through as
as an asset,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3739-1
00:34:25.407 --> 00:34:28.883
<v Mark Sedge>does that actually does that resonate
what I'm talking about?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3746-0
00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:30.919
Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3747-0
00:34:31.519 --> 00:34:31.679
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3757-0
00:34:33.039 --> 00:34:36.279
And the and what about the ability to to
add additional assets?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3764-0
00:34:36.243 --> 00:34:39.700
<v Mark Sedge>100% yeah, yeah. As soon as you. Yeah.
And you can link, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3759-0
00:34:37.529 --> 00:34:37.689
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3764-1
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:43.674
<v Mark Sedge>the ultimate piece is that the the moment
you're good to receive that asset,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3764-2
00:34:43.674 --> 00:34:45.944
<v Mark Sedge>you know,
and technically sort of take take</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3764-3
00:34:45.944 --> 00:34:48.369
<v Mark Sedge>purchase of it even before we've
installed it,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3764-4
00:34:48.369 --> 00:34:51.362
<v Mark Sedge>you can at least you can register it to
say here's. Yeah,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3764-5
00:34:51.362 --> 00:34:55.283
<v Mark Sedge>we've got this asset going in this
location potentially. So it enables you.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3771-0
00:34:55.363 --> 00:34:57.894
<v Mark Sedge>To track it,
but also it helps from from an IT</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3771-1
00:34:57.894 --> 00:35:01.717
<v Mark Sedge>perspective or even from an ask
perspective if there's disruption to a</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3771-2
00:35:01.717 --> 00:35:04.356
<v Mark Sedge>floor,
you know the people team might be able to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3771-3
00:35:04.356 --> 00:35:08.286
<v Mark Sedge>send some cons out to say there's going
to be guys working in this area,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3771-4
00:35:08.286 --> 00:35:12.540
<v Mark Sedge>all of that stuff. If there's a possible,
it's what might be worth is having a</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3771-5
00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.963
<v Mark Sedge>focus session. And again, Jill,
my question.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3776-0
00:35:15.043 --> 00:35:19.083
<v Mark Sedge>To you now is.
Is that a phase two or is that something</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3776-1
00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:24.854
<v Mark Sedge>that you would be interested in saying
what could we do potentially in the time</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3776-2
00:35:24.854 --> 00:35:29.831
<v Mark Sedge>it's it's really where you know to the
open floor really what's the,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3776-3
00:35:29.831 --> 00:35:31.923
<v Mark Sedge>what's the appetite for that?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3775-0
00:35:30.083 --> 00:35:30.603
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah. So.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3783-0
00:35:32.283 --> 00:35:36.212
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>My question first would be Leanne,
what role do we currently play in asset</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3783-1
00:35:36.212 --> 00:35:39.826
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>management in terms of maintenance
etcetera from an ask perspective,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3783-2
00:35:39.826 --> 00:35:43.963
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>do we get involved or is it just we will
raise if there's any issues etcetera?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3793-0
00:35:44.779 --> 00:35:48.779
The PPM we don't do anything with it,
I'm asking.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3794-0
00:35:48.363 --> 00:35:51.763
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah, it just goes to Ashley. Yeah. OK,
that's fine.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3798-0
00:35:54.403 --> 00:35:56.643
<v Mark Sedge>So Joe,
it might be just something that the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3798-1
00:35:56.643 --> 00:36:00.360
<v Mark Sedge>facilities guys themselves say.
Let's work together with IT maybe to see</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3801-0
00:35:57.603 --> 00:36:00.798
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I think with IT, yeah,
I think that's that's the way it is.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3798-2
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.123
<v Mark Sedge>what we can do.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3801-1
00:36:00.798 --> 00:36:03.781
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>We're not part of the process.
They know mark. So yeah,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3801-2
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:06.443
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I think it would be for Ashley and IT to
pick up.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3799-0
00:36:04.603 --> 00:36:05.083
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3809-0
00:36:08.229 --> 00:36:10.309
We we just touched on SFG 20 there.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3845-0
00:36:10.399 --> 00:36:15.308
Is there an opportunity to to build that
in or is is this something that we should

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3845-1
00:36:15.308 --> 00:36:18.205
put into the parking lot for another
discussion,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3845-2
00:36:18.205 --> 00:36:22.463
but it's what it does is it just
specifies how to undertake that PPM to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3845-3
00:36:22.463 --> 00:36:24.119
the correct standard really.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3858-0
00:36:24.929 --> 00:36:27.369
So you I think you can you obviously you
can actually.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3864-0
00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:29.519
The the asset to the system.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3880-0
00:36:31.059 --> 00:36:33.779
And it will generate you know,
a process that that you're.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3878-0
00:36:33.789 --> 00:36:34.269
You're doing.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3881-0
00:36:34.059 --> 00:36:34.739
It correctly.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3887-0
00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:39.022
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So what you can do.
So when Josh talked about knowledge and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3887-1
00:36:39.022 --> 00:36:41.570
<v Mark Sedge>I'm I'm feeling this is phase two guys,
right?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3887-2
00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:45.908
<v Mark Sedge>Just just in terms of our core scope or
what because you currently don't if you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3887-3
00:36:45.908 --> 00:36:49.270
<v Mark Sedge>don't have it in Cherwell today,
then yeah, there's no, yeah,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3887-4
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:52.686
<v Mark Sedge>there's no loss of service,
but I think there's an opportunity</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3887-5
00:36:52.686 --> 00:36:54.963
<v Mark Sedge>actually for us to sort of take that away.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3892-0
00:36:55.163 --> 00:36:55.483
<v Mark Sedge>Frame.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3895-0
00:36:55.523 --> 00:36:58.755
<v Mark Sedge>From that as potential phase two.
So let me continue, right,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3895-1
00:36:58.755 --> 00:37:02.516
<v Mark Sedge>so you if you've got an asset,
so you've got an AC unit and you've got</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3895-2
00:37:02.516 --> 00:37:05.377
<v Mark Sedge>procedure as to how to maintain that
things to check,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3895-3
00:37:05.377 --> 00:37:09.457
<v Mark Sedge>you can have things like a knowledge
article which shows the checklist which</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3895-4
00:37:09.457 --> 00:37:13.536
<v Mark Sedge>you know or you can have an attachment to
that record that they download it,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3895-5
00:37:13.536 --> 00:37:15.443
<v Mark Sedge>tick it up and when they've done it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3902-0
00:37:15.523 --> 00:37:18.176
<v Mark Sedge>As part of closure of, say,
a maintenance task,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3902-1
00:37:18.176 --> 00:37:21.105
<v Mark Sedge>they then submit that record with that
closure task.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3902-2
00:37:21.105 --> 00:37:25.803
<v Mark Sedge>So not only do you know it's been visited,
but you can see the checklist of you know</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3898-0
00:37:22.619 --> 00:37:22.779
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3902-3
00:37:25.803 --> 00:37:28.842
<v Mark Sedge>items on there.
And then there's also the opportunity,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3902-4
00:37:28.842 --> 00:37:31.992
<v Mark Sedge>because I've seen this before,
as you can probably tell,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3902-5
00:37:31.992 --> 00:37:35.363
<v Mark Sedge>what you can also do is you can have
points for concern, so.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3909-0
00:37:35.643 --> 00:37:39.622
<v Mark Sedge>Even if it doesn't stop it working,
what they can do is they can issue say</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3909-1
00:37:39.622 --> 00:37:43.069
<v Mark Sedge>for example the philtre.
It might need a new philtre at the next</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3909-2
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:45.456
<v Mark Sedge>service.
What you would do is you'd have the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3909-3
00:37:45.456 --> 00:37:49.594
<v Mark Sedge>ability to make a note on that record.
So when the next schedule came around,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3909-4
00:37:49.594 --> 00:37:52.405
<v Mark Sedge>there was a note to say order a philtre
or whatever.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3909-5
00:37:52.405 --> 00:37:55.163
<v Mark Sedge>So these are things you could explore and
leverage.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3911-0
00:37:55.563 --> 00:37:57.683
<v Mark Sedge>The asset capability of ServiceNow.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3916-0
00:37:58.319 --> 00:37:59.119
Yeah, sounds good.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3933-0
00:37:59.499 --> 00:38:02.414
Let me just see what one of those looks
like 'cause.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3926-0
00:38:01.419 --> 00:38:02.459
Yeah, absolutely.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3933-1
00:38:02.414 --> 00:38:06.099
It's various things we can do. Yeah.
Checklist in the in the task.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3942-0
00:38:06.099 --> 00:38:07.899
Yeah. Good, that makes.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3943-0
00:38:08.259 --> 00:38:10.108
Sense.
Just before we move on because Mark said

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3943-1
00:38:10.108 --> 00:38:10.339
flood.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3970-0
00:38:12.459 --> 00:38:16.388
The I'm I'm assuming when it comes to
like cleaners or like standard scheduled

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3970-1
00:38:16.388 --> 00:38:19.769
items or PPM or reactive items,
there's no real approval workflows,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/3970-2
00:38:19.769 --> 00:38:21.659
it's just you handle it and manage it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4016-0
00:38:23.909 --> 00:38:27.187
Yeah, you think what it is really.
Obviously you know if expenditure we need

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4016-1
00:38:27.187 --> 00:38:30.040
to call out someone else.
And obviously there's a approval process

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4016-2
00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.297
go through.
But normally everyone knows what they're

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4016-3
00:38:32.297 --> 00:38:35.362
doing and we work also closely,
all the contractors that they just when

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4016-4
00:38:35.362 --> 00:38:37.789
this problem we would just get together
and we solve it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4037-0
00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:40.409
Everything's really done very manually.
There's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4038-0
00:38:40.409 --> 00:38:40.729
No, really.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4039-0
00:38:41.049 --> 00:38:43.889
Any sort of proper IT system we use it's
all.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4023-0
00:38:41.403 --> 00:38:41.843
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4071-0
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:47.914
I was thinking even if it's manual,
but like scenarios like flooding where if

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4071-1
00:38:47.914 --> 00:38:50.872
there's extensive costs or I don't know
something's broken,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4071-2
00:38:50.872 --> 00:38:53.436
then you need to get budget in order to
resolve it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4071-3
00:38:53.436 --> 00:38:55.309
Do you have any manual escalations or?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4097-0
00:38:55.759 --> 00:38:57.668
But if it's something that saves the
flooding,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4097-1
00:38:57.668 --> 00:39:00.715
we need to get any on the subcontractors
out the national call me and say,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4097-2
00:39:00.715 --> 00:39:02.989
can I do that?
And he'll tell me the coat and I'll say.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4097-3
00:39:02.989 --> 00:39:03.639
Yeah, yes or no.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4129-0
00:39:03.989 --> 00:39:06.156
OK, fine.
It's just back and forth between you 2

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4129-1
00:39:06.156 --> 00:39:08.853
and then it gets resolved.
There's there's no like, if it's,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4106-0
00:39:07.123 --> 00:39:07.363
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4129-2
00:39:08.853 --> 00:39:11.639
I don't know 20K to solve,
it's there's no official approvals,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4129-3
00:39:11.639 --> 00:39:12.789
it's just we need it done.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4148-0
00:39:12.709 --> 00:39:15.411
Obviously, if it's stupid money,
then obviously I'll go to my direct tab,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4148-1
00:39:15.411 --> 00:39:17.930
but normally I've got my own budget,
so that's that's actually fine.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4148-2
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:18.989
We'll see in between that so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4149-0
00:39:19.499 --> 00:39:20.819
Right. Yeah, cool. Thank you.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4173-0
00:39:21.419 --> 00:39:26.534
Just on the VPM tasks.
So that initial load if if we're happy

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4173-1
00:39:26.534 --> 00:39:29.339
with that list of scheduled items.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4174-0
00:39:29.579 --> 00:39:29.859
We.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4175-0
00:39:30.259 --> 00:39:31.499
Need to migrate that into.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4223-0
00:39:32.019 --> 00:39:35.565
I think it's accurate. I think.
I think I think it covers everything that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4223-1
00:39:35.565 --> 00:39:38.152
we maintain.
So I don't think there's anything that's

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4223-2
00:39:38.152 --> 00:39:42.033
missed. It's just being able to, yeah,
extract what we've got from there and and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4223-3
00:39:42.033 --> 00:39:45.579
make it a bit more prescriptive I think,
yeah. But we could work on that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4224-0
00:39:45.779 --> 00:39:48.859
But do you know if there's a need to edit
those?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4233-0
00:39:49.659 --> 00:39:50.739
Like change schedules or names.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4236-0
00:39:50.999 --> 00:39:52.999
No,
I think I think they're all in line with.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4293-0
00:39:54.569 --> 00:39:56.552
With SFG 20,
from what I've looked at so far,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4293-1
00:39:56.552 --> 00:39:57.889
we've got the licence for them.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4254-0
00:39:58.379 --> 00:39:58.779
So.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4294-0
00:39:58.849 --> 00:39:59.169
I I can.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4295-0
00:39:59.169 --> 00:40:01.329
Kind of cross reference that as well
because.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4296-0
00:40:01.529 --> 00:40:05.344
I think I would have part of our solution
will be if you want to add a new

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4259-0
00:40:01.683 --> 00:40:01.843
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4296-1
00:40:05.344 --> 00:40:09.618
scheduled item or change an existing one.
Just wondering what the appetite for that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4296-2
00:40:09.618 --> 00:40:11.449
is or will it stay as it is forever?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4297-0
00:40:11.849 --> 00:40:12.209
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4321-0
00:40:13.489 --> 00:40:16.231
To me it's everything seems to be in line
at the moment, so I wouldn't.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4311-0
00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:15.059
9.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4321-1
00:40:16.231 --> 00:40:18.249
I don't think we've got a big problem
with changing.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4322-0
00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:19.009
Frequencies.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4323-0
00:40:19.009 --> 00:40:21.249
Or anything as such really.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4326-0
00:40:21.799 --> 00:40:22.799
This transfer is.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4332-0
00:40:22.083 --> 00:40:27.055
<v Mark Sedge>The the only time the only time you do
that is if you procured a new. You know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4332-1
00:40:27.055 --> 00:40:30.038
<v Mark Sedge>if you if you had a situation of new new
floor,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4332-2
00:40:30.038 --> 00:40:34.824
<v Mark Sedge>new office or whatever which had a
component that needed to be on asset that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4332-3
00:40:34.824 --> 00:40:40.045
<v Mark Sedge>needed to maintained you then just add it.
But you'd you do that all as your future</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4332-4
00:40:40.045 --> 00:40:41.163
<v Mark Sedge>state you do that.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4336-0
00:40:41.203 --> 00:40:45.372
<v Mark Sedge>As part of the setup of that asset,
you'd set up the maintenance schedule</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4336-1
00:40:45.372 --> 00:40:49.766
<v Mark Sedge>because you likelihood is you'll be
adding that to a contract of a, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4336-2
00:40:49.766 --> 00:40:52.977
<v Mark Sedge>an engineering firm to, you know,
to fulfil that, right.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4336-3
00:40:52.977 --> 00:40:54.723
<v Mark Sedge>So you just do that as a suite.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4359-0
00:40:56.319 --> 00:40:58.319
Yeah. OK. OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4360-0
00:40:58.319 --> 00:41:01.685
I think we'll we'll get to that in the
solution then what we thought would make

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4360-1
00:41:01.685 --> 00:41:03.199
sense. I think it still makes sense.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4372-0
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:08.869
We we can always. We can always tweak it.
Yeah. But we'll we'll just, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4403-0
00:41:06.999 --> 00:41:10.227
Yeah, yeah. So save that for then? Yeah.
OK,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4403-1
00:41:10.227 --> 00:41:13.598
so tasks are in the system when one is is
due,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4403-2
00:41:13.598 --> 00:41:17.184
you'll get notified that a scheduled task
is due,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4403-3
00:41:17.184 --> 00:41:21.559
and then if it's an internal piece of
work to complete then.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4428-0
00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:26.709
That'll be done by one of your team on my
team if it's an external third party,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4428-1
00:41:26.709 --> 00:41:29.319
then your team will be coordinating the
e-mail.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4432-0
00:41:29.519 --> 00:41:31.439
Yeah, yeah, we, we, we we have a.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4451-0
00:41:31.319 --> 00:41:34.885
Subcontractor planner. If you like.
So I tracker with with, you know,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4451-1
00:41:34.885 --> 00:41:38.399
scheduled dates and things like that.
So we'll see that information.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4471-0
00:41:39.679 --> 00:41:43.755
And then how so if if that task is there
but it's external,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4471-1
00:41:43.755 --> 00:41:47.559
do you close the task as soon as you've
contacted them?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4516-0
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:51.968
As soon as it's completed and we've got
the the service sheet and that that we

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4488-0
00:41:49.529 --> 00:41:51.769
All right. OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4516-1
00:41:51.968 --> 00:41:54.583
closed out,
we need the evidence obviously that it's

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4516-2
00:41:54.583 --> 00:41:57.149
been completed and once we're happy with
that then.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4494-0
00:41:56.403 --> 00:41:56.563
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4517-0
00:41:57.149 --> 00:42:00.173
It'll close, correct. Yeah, sounds good.
It's a complete task.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4517-1
00:42:00.173 --> 00:42:03.629
They will inform you it's complete.
You complete, you close the ticket.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4521-0
00:42:04.439 --> 00:42:05.399
All right, I think that's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4528-0
00:42:07.279 --> 00:42:07.919
Pretty, pretty accurate then.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4538-0
00:42:09.439 --> 00:42:11.417
Just check one thing.
We're talking tickets here.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4538-1
00:42:11.417 --> 00:42:13.079
This is an insure one at the moment is it?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4542-0
00:42:15.649 --> 00:42:16.609
Closing the job down itself.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4551-0
00:42:17.579 --> 00:42:20.099
So transitive mainstance is not inherit.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4559-0
00:42:22.049 --> 00:42:24.089
It is a chewer OK OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4562-0
00:42:25.659 --> 00:42:25.939
Thanks.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4567-0
00:42:27.899 --> 00:42:29.059
Good, good clarification, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4568-0
00:42:28.649 --> 00:42:28.809
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4576-0
00:42:29.843 --> 00:42:33.254
<v Mark Sedge>And just on that one, actually,
when you close in you,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4576-1
00:42:33.254 --> 00:42:37.719
<v Mark Sedge>you'd still said you know you'd want to
be satisfied. That's been done.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4576-2
00:42:37.719 --> 00:42:41.192
<v Mark Sedge>Do they do they? Yeah.
Do they still submit any sort of</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4576-3
00:42:41.192 --> 00:42:44.292
<v Mark Sedge>attachment,
any sort of record that you'd want to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4576-4
00:42:44.292 --> 00:42:48.323
<v Mark Sedge>attach to say one of these tasks as your
evidence of completion?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4610-0
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:50.833
Yeah, I mean it,
it would be good to do that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4610-1
00:42:50.833 --> 00:42:55.700
It doesn't happen at the moment. But yeah,
I mean something that we could upload

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4586-0
00:42:52.483 --> 00:42:52.883
<v Mark Sedge>Brian.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4610-2
00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:00.267
into into the completed task if we could
download a service sheet or take a

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4610-3
00:43:00.267 --> 00:43:01.709
photograph of the asset.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4608-0
00:43:02.043 --> 00:43:02.523
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4620-0
00:43:02.979 --> 00:43:04.539
Hey, that's fine. Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4649-0
00:43:03.399 --> 00:43:04.039
Yeah, files.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4650-0
00:43:04.519 --> 00:43:08.559
That would that would be a bit more
prompt. Yeah. Yeah, do.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4627-0
00:43:06.489 --> 00:43:06.929
From that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4651-0
00:43:08.559 --> 00:43:11.355
We have any,
I don't know if we've already reviewed it,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4651-1
00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:15.199
but do we have any logic between the
scheduled item and the ticket creation?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4668-0
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:18.482
So I need like a week in advance month in
advance.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4668-1
00:43:18.482 --> 00:43:20.989
Does it depend on the priority of the
schedule item?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4705-0
00:43:20.719 --> 00:43:24.856
It's it's generally just scheduled on a
month by month basis,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4705-1
00:43:24.856 --> 00:43:28.659
so we can look at obviously as the new
one rolls around,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4705-2
00:43:28.659 --> 00:43:33.930
then the new schedules hit sharewell and
we see obviously what's scheduled for

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4705-3
00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.199
specific dates and we'll know for.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4710-0
00:43:37.279 --> 00:43:38.439
Our from our planners.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4721-0
00:43:40.039 --> 00:43:43.479
Any subcontracted band dates that will be
uploaded into that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4729-0
00:43:45.639 --> 00:43:50.959
Anything else? Mould on the as it process,
I think that's clear.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4733-0
00:43:51.299 --> 00:43:52.219
Relatively simple, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4778-0
00:43:52.869 --> 00:43:53.229
All right.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4779-0
00:43:53.669 --> 00:43:58.194
Good stuff that helps us inform the next
stages. So I guess, yeah,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4779-1
00:43:58.194 --> 00:44:01.773
it's captured some some of other current
state bits.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4779-2
00:44:01.773 --> 00:44:06.703
So reporting wise PPM scheduling tool
shows planned tasks for the month,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4779-3
00:44:06.703 --> 00:44:09.269
that's what you just explained Ashley.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4796-0
00:44:10.239 --> 00:44:15.819
And the reporting tool showing complete
BPM task. Other reports that was out.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4796-1
00:44:15.819 --> 00:44:17.679
That's all I had captured.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4804-0
00:44:19.139 --> 00:44:21.219
Yeah, I think that's it, isn't it? Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4813-0
00:44:20.119 --> 00:44:20.799
That's pretty much.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4814-0
00:44:21.519 --> 00:44:25.596
OK. All right.
Got that one assets we've talked about.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4814-1
00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:26.559
That's great.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4847-0
00:44:27.719 --> 00:44:31.340
Priority levels,
that's an interesting one to what we've

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4847-1
00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:36.105
captured is P1's touch on a little bit
intended 1 to 4 hour response time,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4847-2
00:44:36.105 --> 00:44:37.439
but is that captured?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4867-0
00:44:37.249 --> 00:44:41.369
It is an interesting 1 the priorities
because we've had we've had.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4861-0
00:44:41.669 --> 00:44:42.229
A few issues.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4868-0
00:44:42.369 --> 00:44:44.929
Recently where P1.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4890-0
00:44:46.629 --> 00:44:51.301
Seem to close before we've had a chance
to get the task completed,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4890-1
00:44:51.301 --> 00:44:54.509
so it would go down as an SLA on Ola
failure.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4903-0
00:44:55.429 --> 00:44:58.770
That somebody else has addressed it,
though somebody hasn't just closed the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4903-1
00:44:58.770 --> 00:44:59.429
ticket because.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4918-0
00:45:00.969 --> 00:45:05.209
No, it just seems to time out.
So if we've got a one to four.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4936-0
00:45:06.009 --> 00:45:10.769
Our priority on AP1 and I'm assuming
that's that's what has been set up,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4936-1
00:45:10.769 --> 00:45:12.529
it could close down within.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4952-0
00:45:14.279 --> 00:45:17.641
You know 50 minutes less than an hour.
That's good. So we've,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4952-1
00:45:17.641 --> 00:45:19.919
we've we've had issues with that recently.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4962-0
00:45:21.369 --> 00:45:23.569
So ServiceNow in general but won't close.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4984-0
00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:28.186
Can have triggered P1 and then it's
escalated saying your SLA has been hit,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4984-1
00:45:28.186 --> 00:45:30.359
but it won't just randomly close so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4993-0
00:45:29.969 --> 00:45:33.249
Yeah.
Which is which is with with sherwell.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/4996-0
00:45:32.279 --> 00:45:34.079
That's not ideal at all.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5040-0
00:45:35.089 --> 00:45:39.160
It's strange. Yeah.
So would we have clearly sort of defined

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5040-1
00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:43.365
one's full priorities.
So would priority four be an extendable

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5040-2
00:45:43.365 --> 00:45:47.169
time if imparts are required and things
like that? Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5047-0
00:45:45.169 --> 00:45:48.157
Can we can set that up based on on your
need? Yeah. Yeah. So.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5036-0
00:45:47.763 --> 00:45:48.083
<v Mark Sedge>So.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5047-1
00:45:48.157 --> 00:45:51.289
So we've got a slide on Slas. Sorry, Mark,
do you want to input?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5055-0
00:45:51.643 --> 00:45:54.233
<v Mark Sedge>No, no.
All I was going to say is part of what we</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5055-1
00:45:54.233 --> 00:45:57.599
<v Mark Sedge>would do if you're having that experience,
where there's doubts,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5055-2
00:45:57.599 --> 00:46:01.069
<v Mark Sedge>if you like in the reputation,
what we would do is do a baselining</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5055-3
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:03.710
<v Mark Sedge>activity.
So by the nature of what you're getting,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5055-4
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:06.559
<v Mark Sedge>you'll have greater controls on the
closures we would,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5055-5
00:46:06.559 --> 00:46:10.961
<v Mark Sedge>we would look because you'll you may well
have certain assets that even if it's AP1,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5055-6
00:46:10.961 --> 00:46:11.323
<v Mark Sedge>if the.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5062-0
00:46:11.483 --> 00:46:15.862
<v Mark Sedge>Maintenance or the controls activity that
you need to do takes you know it takes</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5062-1
00:46:15.862 --> 00:46:19.484
<v Mark Sedge>you say 2 hours to strip it down,
maintain 2 hours to put it back.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5062-2
00:46:19.484 --> 00:46:23.809
<v Mark Sedge>You're never going to hit the target.
So what you'd want to do is you'd want to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5062-3
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:28.026
<v Mark Sedge>have exceptions because the the whole
point about the priority is getting the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5062-4
00:46:28.026 --> 00:46:31.323
<v Mark Sedge>right person to initiate and resolve.
But if the actual act.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5065-0
00:46:31.403 --> 00:46:34.182
<v Mark Sedge>Activity is longer than it becomes a moot
point,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5065-1
00:46:34.182 --> 00:46:38.606
<v Mark Sedge>but what you can do is we can then start
to look at what is the sensible Olas</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5065-2
00:46:38.606 --> 00:46:42.178
<v Mark Sedge>based upon priority,
but also based upon the component that or</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5065-3
00:46:42.178 --> 00:46:44.163
<v Mark Sedge>the asset that you're dealing with.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5067-0
00:46:45.519 --> 00:46:45.759
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5073-0
00:46:46.243 --> 00:46:49.156
<v Mark Sedge>Because in the real world, yeah.
And I'm being, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5073-1
00:46:49.156 --> 00:46:51.917
<v Mark Sedge>maybe maybe not quite a pedant,
but in the real world,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5073-2
00:46:51.917 --> 00:46:55.834
<v Mark Sedge>you will have situations where you'll
never be able to do something within an</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5073-3
00:46:55.834 --> 00:46:59.148
<v Mark Sedge>hour, however much you know.
And the whole point is it's a target</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5073-4
00:46:59.148 --> 00:47:02.763
<v Mark Sedge>point, right? You know, if, for example,
you have to respond to a leak.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5080-0
00:47:03.043 --> 00:47:05.900
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
or flooding as I pick on my bank analogy,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5080-1
00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:10.363
<v Mark Sedge>it used to take them about 16 hours
because it was a basement in York that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5080-2
00:47:10.363 --> 00:47:13.457
<v Mark Sedge>was flooding.
They literally took about 16 hours to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5080-3
00:47:13.457 --> 00:47:18.039
<v Mark Sedge>have the pumps available and empty.
There's no way you can hold them account</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5080-4
00:47:18.039 --> 00:47:22.323
<v Mark Sedge>for a four hour recovery when they're in
that situation. So it's about.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5086-0
00:47:22.843 --> 00:47:28.090
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, responding. And you know,
resolution within the bounds of what that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5086-1
00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:32.344
<v Mark Sedge>asset necessitates. OK,
so part of what we can start to do,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5086-2
00:47:32.344 --> 00:47:36.527
<v Mark Sedge>not immediately.
But after you've got a few records in and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5086-3
00:47:36.527 --> 00:47:40.923
<v Mark Sedge>we start to Josh's point producing those
that you know those.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5092-0
00:47:41.243 --> 00:47:46.919
<v Mark Sedge>Averages the information the Intel the MI.
You can then start to baseline what is</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5092-1
00:47:46.919 --> 00:47:50.242
<v Mark Sedge>fair,
what type of task results in what type of</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5092-2
00:47:50.242 --> 00:47:54.741
<v Mark Sedge>Ola that you can expect,
or what type of contractual expectation</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5092-3
00:47:54.741 --> 00:47:57.163
<v Mark Sedge>you might have on a given provider.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5094-0
00:47:57.483 --> 00:48:01.843
<v Mark Sedge>And then that plays up into what you
actually confirm as your service levels.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5100-0
00:48:03.339 --> 00:48:04.219
And equally you today.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5097-0
00:48:03.483 --> 00:48:04.203
<v Mark Sedge>Make sense?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5107-0
00:48:04.889 --> 00:48:06.369
Yeah. Yeah, it does. Yeah, I'm.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5127-0
00:48:06.659 --> 00:48:06.779
And.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5108-0
00:48:06.769 --> 00:48:07.009
From a.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5128-0
00:48:06.979 --> 00:48:10.203
Change perspective.
You don't want Slas or Olas that people

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5128-1
00:48:10.203 --> 00:48:12.943
just don't take seriously,
because if you're like,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5128-2
00:48:12.943 --> 00:48:14.179
I'm never going to hit.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5189-0
00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:19.084
It's it's wasted effort.
You kind of want people to hit it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5189-1
00:48:19.084 --> 00:48:22.298
So to Mark's point,
like be realistic of what you can do.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5189-2
00:48:22.298 --> 00:48:25.844
And the other thing we've said with other
just for consistency,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5189-3
00:48:25.844 --> 00:48:28.614
because we've had quite a few of these
workshops.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5189-4
00:48:28.614 --> 00:48:33.213
We've said that maybe on day one we don't
have Olas or Slas, but we have the data.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5189-5
00:48:33.213 --> 00:48:35.319
So there's been up, there's been some.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5216-0
00:48:36.289 --> 00:48:39.451
Reservations about the data in Shareworld
or you know,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5216-1
00:48:39.451 --> 00:48:43.360
are we being held to the right data or
was that the right KPI? Joe,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5216-2
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.969
you can keep me honest here.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5267-0
00:48:46.519 --> 00:48:50.532
But we've said like maybe we just have a
period or a grace period to see what is

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5267-1
00:48:50.532 --> 00:48:54.545
actually available for 1/4, let's say,
and then have the discussion with Mark or

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5267-2
00:48:54.545 --> 00:48:57.369
with the workstream leads and with your
leadership team,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5267-3
00:48:57.369 --> 00:49:00.341
as to let's say your turn around time is
3 days, make it 4,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5267-4
00:49:00.341 --> 00:49:02.719
give yourself some grace and then you can
work.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5278-0
00:49:03.609 --> 00:49:05.769
Work down or more efficiently.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5277-0
00:49:05.199 --> 00:49:06.159
Yeah, that makes sense.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5286-0
00:49:06.803 --> 00:49:09.941
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah,
I think it's important across all areas</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5286-1
00:49:09.941 --> 00:49:15.331
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>IT facilities ask that we approach OL ES
and SL ES and same or similar ways so</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5281-0
00:49:10.409 --> 00:49:10.849
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5286-2
00:49:15.331 --> 00:49:18.878
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>that we can measure that data.
If we don't have it,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5283-0
00:49:15.883 --> 00:49:16.043
<v Mark Sedge>Yep.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5286-3
00:49:18.878 --> 00:49:24.267
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>obviously there may be pockets where
we've got clear SL ES that are agreed and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5286-4
00:49:24.267 --> 00:49:25.563
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>we can put them in.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5289-0
00:49:25.643 --> 00:49:28.327
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>And obviously,
but I think if we're still trying to work</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5289-1
00:49:28.327 --> 00:49:30.963
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>out what those are,
we should approach it consistently.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5330-0
00:49:32.149 --> 00:49:36.590
There be the option to if we're attending
a say for instance of AP 1.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5330-1
00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:40.714
So we've we've responded we're there,
we're where we need to be.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5330-2
00:49:40.714 --> 00:49:45.789
Obviously we need to extend the time on
that. There'll be an option to do that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5367-0
00:49:46.079 --> 00:49:50.283
I think having the web application would
help with that. Would it not?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5367-1
00:49:50.283 --> 00:49:55.019
Having like on the mobile phone and you
think you'll have that option to see us

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5351-0
00:49:54.203 --> 00:49:54.443
<v Mark Sedge>2.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5366-0
00:49:54.259 --> 00:49:56.619
Much changes, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5367-2
00:49:55.019 --> 00:49:58.039
and audit trails is why we can't close it
on time.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5357-0
00:49:56.483 --> 00:49:56.603
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5369-0
00:49:58.963 --> 00:50:03.227
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So how does that work in the system?
It would probably help us understand and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5376-0
00:50:02.683 --> 00:50:07.193
<v Mark Sedge>So. So yeah, to to Joe,
there's a piece of me that's sort of</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5369-1
00:50:03.227 --> 00:50:03.883
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>decide that.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5376-1
00:50:07.193 --> 00:50:10.224
<v Mark Sedge>going.
Why wouldn't you just utilise the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5376-2
00:50:10.224 --> 00:50:16.434
<v Mark Sedge>standard incident management practise and
activity say that it might utilise but we</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5376-3
00:50:16.434 --> 00:50:21.683
<v Mark Sedge>utilise the the capability, if you like,
for facilities such that you?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5383-0
00:50:21.883 --> 00:50:25.084
<v Mark Sedge>You know you can update an instant record.
Do you know what I mean?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5383-1
00:50:25.084 --> 00:50:27.155
<v Mark Sedge>You actually manage it just like you
would,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5383-2
00:50:27.155 --> 00:50:30.968
<v Mark Sedge>because anything of the high priority is
pretty much a significant incident that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5383-3
00:50:30.968 --> 00:50:33.792
<v Mark Sedge>you need to address or resolve.
So some of those, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5383-4
00:50:33.792 --> 00:50:36.946
<v Mark Sedge>there's a piece of me that sort of says
from a system perspective.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5383-5
00:50:36.946 --> 00:50:40.617
<v Mark Sedge>And this is something we'll take away.
Josh, whether we can, whether there's,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5383-6
00:50:40.617 --> 00:50:41.323
<v Mark Sedge>you know, some.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5390-0
00:50:41.523 --> 00:50:45.198
<v Mark Sedge>Sort of alignment,
but certainly a lot of organisations will</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5390-1
00:50:45.198 --> 00:50:49.716
<v Mark Sedge>just use the IT standard instant
management activity because it aligns and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5390-2
00:50:49.716 --> 00:50:53.572
<v Mark Sedge>it enables all of the things you're
asking for. So for example,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5390-3
00:50:53.572 --> 00:50:58.150
<v Mark Sedge>actually you might have an update and the
record say we know this is taking</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5390-4
00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:01.403
<v Mark Sedge>extended, yeah,
we've advised the business it's been.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5397-0
00:51:01.443 --> 00:51:04.272
<v Mark Sedge>Accepted.
Therefore you can you can make you know</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5397-1
00:51:04.272 --> 00:51:08.629
<v Mark Sedge>just in essence excluded from the SLA
because you know you're addressing it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5397-2
00:51:08.629 --> 00:51:12.476
<v Mark Sedge>You know you're on track and there's,
yeah, there's no, there's no,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5397-3
00:51:12.476 --> 00:51:14.966
<v Mark Sedge>there's nothing more you can do to
achieve.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5397-4
00:51:14.966 --> 00:51:18.983
<v Mark Sedge>Perhaps some of those targets or what we
can do in certain situations,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5397-5
00:51:18.983 --> 00:51:20.963
<v Mark Sedge>you'll make them SLA exempt, right.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5404-0
00:51:21.043 --> 00:51:24.213
<v Mark Sedge>So depending on the service category that
you select,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5404-1
00:51:24.213 --> 00:51:29.025
<v Mark Sedge>you know extreme flooding or whatever or
certain criteria for facilities power or</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5404-2
00:51:29.025 --> 00:51:33.838
<v Mark Sedge>you know could say for example you lose a,
you lose a site say you've got site in</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5404-3
00:51:33.838 --> 00:51:37.946
<v Mark Sedge>you know Mumbai or something like that
because there's been monsoons.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5404-4
00:51:37.946 --> 00:51:40.763
<v Mark Sedge>And again I've been here where you've
lost all.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5409-0
00:51:40.883 --> 00:51:45.722
<v Mark Sedge>Power to that office and what have you.
It is no point having an SLA on that.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5409-1
00:51:45.722 --> 00:51:49.568
<v Mark Sedge>That becomes a, you know,
almost like a sort of not quite the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5409-2
00:51:49.568 --> 00:51:52.980
<v Mark Sedge>disaster event,
but that becomes a heightened level of</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5409-3
00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:56.020
<v Mark Sedge>incident,
but you're not able to totally control</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5409-4
00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.563
<v Mark Sedge>the outcome. So you that would be exempt.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5416-0
00:51:59.083 --> 00:52:02.983
<v Mark Sedge>Based on that categorization,
you'd have it exempt from your Slas.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5416-1
00:52:02.983 --> 00:52:07.523
<v Mark Sedge>These are all things that the standard
instant rocess could do for you if you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5416-2
00:52:07.523 --> 00:52:11.655
<v Mark Sedge>wanted to adopt that, but again,
I'm being really careful here why I'm</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5416-3
00:52:11.655 --> 00:52:16.486
<v Mark Sedge>sort of leveraging towards Josh needs to
do. It may be that phase one, we do this,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5416-4
00:52:16.486 --> 00:52:18.523
<v Mark Sedge>but it might be in a further phase.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5422-0
00:52:19.203 --> 00:52:23.718
<v Mark Sedge>When we look at your assets and other
bits and pieces that actually you migrate</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5422-1
00:52:23.718 --> 00:52:28.401
<v Mark Sedge>over for the need and for the situations
you've described to actually exploit some</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5422-2
00:52:28.401 --> 00:52:31.787
<v Mark Sedge>of the more core,
you know capabilities within the platform</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5422-3
00:52:31.787 --> 00:52:35.398
<v Mark Sedge>at an enterprise level,
because I would be counselling a bit of</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5422-4
00:52:35.398 --> 00:52:38.163
<v Mark Sedge>that because it enables ticket transfer
between.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5429-0
00:52:38.883 --> 00:52:42.815
<v Mark Sedge>And you guys through if it get to the
site because your users are complaining</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5429-1
00:52:42.815 --> 00:52:45.738
<v Mark Sedge>that their, yeah,
their powers flicking and they find the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5429-2
00:52:45.738 --> 00:52:49.266
<v Mark Sedge>situation they might want to move that
instant ticket into your group</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5429-3
00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:52.139
<v Mark Sedge>maintenance group.
So you can engage and work with it to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5429-4
00:52:52.139 --> 00:52:55.869
<v Mark Sedge>recover that situation because sometimes
I'm sure you won't be working in</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5429-5
00:52:55.869 --> 00:52:57.683
<v Mark Sedge>isolation. There will be some other.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5431-0
00:52:58.363 --> 00:53:00.683
<v Mark Sedge>Implications, right?
Do you see where I'm coming from?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5434-0
00:53:00.079 --> 00:53:00.319
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5435-0
00:53:00.979 --> 00:53:01.659
Yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5443-0
00:53:02.483 --> 00:53:05.534
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>And is any of that in place at the moment?
Ashley. Sam,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5443-1
00:53:05.534 --> 00:53:10.111
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>like where you would work with IT in that
particular instance because I'm conscious</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5443-2
00:53:10.111 --> 00:53:13.652
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>from an *** perspective,
we don't necessarily have incident that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5443-3
00:53:13.652 --> 00:53:17.684
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>would impact wide things like that.
We are very much like service driven.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5443-4
00:53:17.684 --> 00:53:21.443
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So it's not necessarily something that
stops anything in its tracks.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5451-0
00:53:21.963 --> 00:53:25.769
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>But is there situations where you have
agreements with IT just now around</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5451-1
00:53:25.769 --> 00:53:28.340
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>different things that might crossover
both sides?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5451-2
00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:32.043
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>If it's like a major incident or anything
like that that comes through.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5472-0
00:53:31.079 --> 00:53:34.658
I don't think there's any. All.
There's not any any sort of automated

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5472-1
00:53:34.658 --> 00:53:37.623
integration really.
It's just communicate that really you

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5458-0
00:53:35.203 --> 00:53:35.643
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5461-0
00:53:36.443 --> 00:53:36.723
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5507-0
00:53:36.739 --> 00:53:37.099
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5472-2
00:53:37.623 --> 00:53:37.879
know.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5466-0
00:53:37.803 --> 00:53:38.123
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5508-0
00:53:38.059 --> 00:53:39.797
Let's go hands on deck, mate.
If you haven't flood,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5508-1
00:53:39.797 --> 00:53:40.499
you know what I mean.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5509-0
00:53:40.499 --> 00:53:43.429
Could be the landlords are involved,
could be the cleaners. It could be M&amp;

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5487-0
00:53:41.749 --> 00:53:42.029
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5480-0
00:53:41.883 --> 00:53:42.123
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Hmm.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5481-0
00:53:41.883 --> 00:53:42.203
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5509-1
00:53:43.429 --> 00:53:45.060
A.
Could you know a whole host of different

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5509-2
00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.619
people involved just to get the matter
resolved as soon as possible?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5499-0
00:53:45.139 --> 00:53:45.379
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5538-0
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:49.967
Yeah, I see it.
Can I take your point about business

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5510-0
00:53:47.883 --> 00:53:48.883
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So but but.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5503-0
00:53:47.963 --> 00:53:48.163
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5538-1
00:53:49.967 --> 00:53:52.300
continuity?
It could be something where a number of

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5520-0
00:53:50.723 --> 00:53:52.243
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah, it makes sense, yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5538-2
00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:55.621
different teams need to get involved,
so maybe that sits aside from it's,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5538-3
00:53:55.621 --> 00:53:57.909
it's got its own category, hasn't it,
if you like?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5531-0
00:53:56.083 --> 00:53:56.203
<v Mark Sedge>Well.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5545-0
00:53:58.403 --> 00:54:01.141
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, it's, it's something.
It's something to explore,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5539-0
00:53:59.443 --> 00:54:01.523
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I think it's yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5545-1
00:54:01.141 --> 00:54:05.023
<v Mark Sedge>guys is what I'm thinking. As I say,
it may not be for this phase because the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5545-2
00:54:05.023 --> 00:54:08.805
<v Mark Sedge>priority we're trying to do here is get
ourselves off Cherwell and keep you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5545-3
00:54:08.805 --> 00:54:11.493
<v Mark Sedge>operational.
But what I'm what I'm suggesting is some</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5545-4
00:54:11.493 --> 00:54:14.330
<v Mark Sedge>of that thinking, Josh,
that we might need to do is say,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5545-5
00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:17.963
<v Mark Sedge>what can we do in foundations if if
there's a benefit case to move them.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5552-0
00:54:18.043 --> 00:54:22.081
<v Mark Sedge>More towards, you know,
a sort of standardised instant process or</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5552-1
00:54:22.081 --> 00:54:26.976
<v Mark Sedge>whatever it is that we know and love from
an IT angle that aligns to what these</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5552-2
00:54:26.976 --> 00:54:29.913
<v Mark Sedge>guys do, you know,
in their day-to-day as well.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5552-3
00:54:29.913 --> 00:54:34.624
<v Mark Sedge>I think there's an opportunity for
further discussion on that to say is that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5552-4
00:54:34.624 --> 00:54:36.643
<v Mark Sedge>something we put on the road map.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5558-0
00:54:37.283 --> 00:54:40.885
<v Mark Sedge>Once you're, you know,
once you're off and using service now you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5558-1
00:54:40.885 --> 00:54:44.597
<v Mark Sedge>know because you know you,
you can evolve and the whole point here</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5558-2
00:54:44.597 --> 00:54:47.422
<v Mark Sedge>is we want to get you to a position of
betterment.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5558-3
00:54:47.422 --> 00:54:51.633
<v Mark Sedge>But the whole point of the enterprise is
you is you do have that cross team</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5558-4
00:54:51.633 --> 00:54:54.680
<v Mark Sedge>collaboration.
You have full visibility of activities,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5558-5
00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:55.123
<v Mark Sedge>tickets.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5565-0
00:54:55.363 --> 00:54:58.116
<v Mark Sedge>You know you can transfer activities
across, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5565-1
00:54:58.116 --> 00:55:01.770
<v Mark Sedge>and I'll give you another example where
that could be beneficial to use.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5565-2
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:05.624
<v Mark Sedge>The ITSM capabilities is, say for example,
you've got maintenance and it's a</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5565-3
00:55:05.624 --> 00:55:08.527
<v Mark Sedge>generator test on a given building or
whatever, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5565-4
00:55:08.527 --> 00:55:12.481
<v Mark Sedge>you need to be able to raise a change to
tell the IT team that because if they</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5565-5
00:55:12.481 --> 00:55:14.683
<v Mark Sedge>suddenly see a load of components
dropping.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5572-0
00:55:15.043 --> 00:55:17.816
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
at that time you don't want them calling</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5572-1
00:55:17.816 --> 00:55:22.275
<v Mark Sedge>people up in the middle of the night if
they've seen a change request from you to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5572-2
00:55:22.275 --> 00:55:26.462
<v Mark Sedge>say at this time to this time we're doing
Jenny tests, you know what I mean?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5572-3
00:55:26.462 --> 00:55:29.235
<v Mark Sedge>So naturally, you know,
it's part of my IT cap on.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5572-4
00:55:29.235 --> 00:55:32.660
<v Mark Sedge>I think there's some areas where we want
to join up, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5572-5
00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:34.563
<v Mark Sedge>and and start to bring it together.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5579-0
00:55:34.683 --> 00:55:39.145
<v Mark Sedge>And even if it's not something you do
today as systemically, there might be an,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5579-1
00:55:39.145 --> 00:55:41.989
<v Mark Sedge>you know,
because you're doing it through dialogue</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5579-2
00:55:41.989 --> 00:55:45.503
<v Mark Sedge>and everything else across team,
the collaborations happening.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5579-3
00:55:45.503 --> 00:55:49.351
<v Mark Sedge>But what it can do is enable you to do
that with a systemic support,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5579-4
00:55:49.351 --> 00:55:52.642
<v Mark Sedge>giving you audit trail,
giving you all of the information,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5579-5
00:55:52.642 --> 00:55:54.203
<v Mark Sedge>giving you records that you.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5585-0
00:55:54.323 --> 00:55:57.058
<v Mark Sedge>You can look back on and you can do trend
analysis,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5585-1
00:55:57.058 --> 00:55:59.529
<v Mark Sedge>improvement and all of that good stuff,
right?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5585-2
00:55:59.529 --> 00:56:03.947
<v Mark Sedge>Do you think there's an appetite for that?
Is that something you want to look at or</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5585-3
00:56:03.947 --> 00:56:06.523
<v Mark Sedge>do we just stick with what you've got
today and?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5612-0
00:56:06.799 --> 00:56:11.316
It would be a betterment than what we've
got. Yeah. So, you know, if you take that,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5612-1
00:56:11.316 --> 00:56:14.919
for instance with, with,
with the generator testing, so we've got.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5616-0
00:56:14.919 --> 00:56:16.919
Coming up in March, Sam, haven't we?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5639-0
00:56:17.269 --> 00:56:21.351
So that communication with the IT team
starts now we start to talk about you

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5639-1
00:56:21.351 --> 00:56:23.949
know, potential shutdowns,
black building tests.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5667-0
00:56:24.869 --> 00:56:27.715
There's communication also with the
landlords,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5667-1
00:56:27.715 --> 00:56:31.045
so there's quite a few different sort of
moving parts,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5653-0
00:56:29.203 --> 00:56:30.803
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5667-2
00:56:31.045 --> 00:56:35.829
but it is just communication via e-mail
at the moment and you know we capture.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5675-0
00:56:33.563 --> 00:56:37.314
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So, so if you had the situation,
so if you had the situation, this is the,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5663-0
00:56:34.363 --> 00:56:35.763
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah. So yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5675-1
00:56:37.314 --> 00:56:40.325
<v Mark Sedge>I think the point, right,
if you had the situation where someone</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5675-2
00:56:40.325 --> 00:56:43.705
<v Mark Sedge>said, well, you didn't tell me,
but you know you've got it through comms</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5670-0
00:56:42.509 --> 00:56:42.709
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5675-3
00:56:43.705 --> 00:56:46.854
<v Mark Sedge>because it's in the system,
it's in a record and you've got some of</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5675-4
00:56:46.854 --> 00:56:50.652
<v Mark Sedge>that because we can do auto note, yeah,
there's a lot of things that the tool can</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5673-0
00:56:49.419 --> 00:56:50.059
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5675-5
00:56:50.652 --> 00:56:51.763
<v Mark Sedge>do for you. It cuts out.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5678-0
00:56:52.123 --> 00:56:56.151
<v Mark Sedge>That e-mail traffic and you've got it.
The audit trial in a record or you've got</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5678-1
00:56:56.151 --> 00:56:57.443
<v Mark Sedge>the construct in a record.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5685-0
00:56:58.003 --> 00:57:00.440
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah,
it's it's definitely part of the NT and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5680-0
00:56:58.249 --> 00:56:58.489
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5685-1
00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:04.308
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>appetite obviously of the firm to
categorise everything that we're doing</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5685-2
00:57:04.308 --> 00:57:07.804
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>across all the functions,
which is what the service catalogue has</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5685-3
00:57:07.804 --> 00:57:10.771
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>started to do.
It's probably not a priority for service</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5685-4
00:57:10.771 --> 00:57:14.904
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>design that's been surfaced at the moment,
but it is something that we should</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5685-5
00:57:14.904 --> 00:57:17.923
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>certainly capture because when we come to
look at phase.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5693-0
00:57:18.003 --> 00:57:21.880
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>To depending on what's in that list,
we're going to need to prioritise it,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5693-1
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.257
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>right?
So it might be that these are the ones</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5689-0
00:57:22.963 --> 00:57:23.403
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5693-2
00:57:24.257 --> 00:57:28.547
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>that we start to prioritise depending on
what the biggest demand and impact is and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5693-3
00:57:28.547 --> 00:57:31.235
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>things like that.
So I think we need to capture it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5693-4
00:57:31.235 --> 00:57:35.163
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>It's a parking lot or a future decision
type thing. So it doesn't get lost.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5692-0
00:57:34.323 --> 00:57:35.803
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5736-0
00:57:38.219 --> 00:57:42.251
Definitely nice maturity step.
Better to parking lot for future.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5736-1
00:57:42.251 --> 00:57:45.601
I think we've got a little bit on that
later as well,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5714-0
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.349
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5736-2
00:57:45.601 --> 00:57:49.696
but it's probably the same conversation,
OK, just on the SLA bit,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5736-3
00:57:49.696 --> 00:57:51.619
just close it out. But is that?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5737-0
00:57:51.619 --> 00:57:51.779
What?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5738-0
00:57:52.259 --> 00:57:54.299
We've got there intended 1 to 4 is that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5750-0
00:57:55.079 --> 00:57:56.721
People,
your customers know that it's a

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5750-1
00:57:56.721 --> 00:57:58.199
communicated thing. That's your SLA.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5768-0
00:57:59.559 --> 00:58:01.639
No,
it's not really communicate out just for

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5760-0
00:58:00.799 --> 00:58:01.159
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5768-1
00:58:01.639 --> 00:58:04.319
internal for usage when we have proper
reviews and stuff.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5779-0
00:58:02.839 --> 00:58:06.760
Yeah, OK.
We only really seem CP ones and P twos I

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5779-1
00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.759
think really.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5793-0
00:58:08.189 --> 00:58:10.589
We're done it in the realms of trees,
of course.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5794-0
00:58:10.829 --> 00:58:11.709
Right. Yeah, that's what.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5811-0
00:58:11.929 --> 00:58:14.980
And amounts pre man is pre populated
isn't it?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5804-0
00:58:14.159 --> 00:58:14.759
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5811-1
00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:18.809
Why pre put in the problem automatically
assigns priority?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5842-0
00:58:19.619 --> 00:58:23.634
Oh yeah, we've had. We've got.
We'll do that in future, though. Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5842-1
00:58:23.634 --> 00:58:27.649
Yeah. And P2 just down here,
I think in the conversation we we didn't

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5842-2
00:58:27.649 --> 00:58:30.459
capture,
did we know what that timer was for P2?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5867-0
00:58:30.959 --> 00:58:35.047
I mean, I'm a normal circumstances,
I would have said 1 to 24 hours,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5867-1
00:58:35.047 --> 00:58:38.187
really once,
4 hours for one P once and P2's 1 to 24

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5867-2
00:58:38.187 --> 00:58:38.839
hours. But.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5874-0
00:58:39.129 --> 00:58:41.409
That's how I've worked in the past.
I don't know how.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5931-0
00:58:42.299 --> 00:58:43.139
Show it was wedding.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5932-0
00:58:43.859 --> 00:58:47.163
Yeah, I say no. We get things. Yeah.
I think it's because we all communicate

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5894-0
00:58:46.139 --> 00:58:46.739
Why aren't I?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5932-1
00:58:47.163 --> 00:58:49.523
with each other.
We don't kind of rely on that sort of

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5903-0
00:58:48.369 --> 00:58:48.769
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5932-2
00:58:49.523 --> 00:58:52.226
data because I've never had it really.
It has worked properly.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5932-3
00:58:52.226 --> 00:58:53.899
So we normally just rely on each other.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5933-0
00:58:53.899 --> 00:58:54.019
And.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5934-0
00:58:54.019 --> 00:58:55.828
We have conversations,
something's delayed.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5934-1
00:58:55.828 --> 00:58:58.419
Then we talk to the person that's
involved in stuff like that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5922-0
00:58:56.043 --> 00:58:56.323
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5975-0
00:58:59.279 --> 00:59:04.039
This seems to work just so that I'm clear.
Is there a global process for this or is

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5975-1
00:59:04.039 --> 00:59:08.176
this just focused on the UK and like
Glasgow office like the UK offices?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5975-2
00:59:08.176 --> 00:59:12.879
So I'm just thinking like let's say if we
were to scale this out for facilities in

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5975-3
00:59:12.879 --> 00:59:14.239
like the Middle East or.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/5981-0
00:59:14.359 --> 00:59:14.679
Or.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6029-0
00:59:15.519 --> 00:59:18.093
To this app on the office,
a lot of them are service offices they

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6029-1
00:59:18.093 --> 00:59:18.639
wouldn't have.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6030-0
00:59:18.639 --> 00:59:18.839
The.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6031-0
00:59:18.839 --> 00:59:22.033
Involvement that we have because we're so
big that we have to have our own M&amp;

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6031-1
00:59:22.033 --> 00:59:23.669
E team,
a lot of them will actually their

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6001-0
00:59:22.843 --> 00:59:22.963
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6031-2
00:59:23.669 --> 00:59:26.279
landlords will do that for them.
So they won't actually have that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6019-0
00:59:24.809 --> 00:59:26.009
OK, it's like ready.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6032-0
00:59:26.279 --> 00:59:28.439
Process, so really ignore me. Yeah,
it's been a big one.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6038-0
00:59:27.603 --> 00:59:30.244
<v Mark Sedge>But that's.
But that's a it's it's an important it's</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6038-1
00:59:30.244 --> 00:59:33.582
<v Mark Sedge>an important point, right,
because if you if if you wanted to make</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6038-2
00:59:33.582 --> 00:59:37.069
<v Mark Sedge>sure that the landlords were responding,
if you're leasing an office,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6038-3
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:40.058
<v Mark Sedge>say in Dubai and you wanted that landlord
to be responsive,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6038-4
00:59:40.058 --> 00:59:42.748
<v Mark Sedge>you want to know how many times have you
called them,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6038-5
00:59:42.748 --> 00:59:46.036
<v Mark Sedge>how many tickets to that office because
that data might tell you,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6038-6
00:59:46.036 --> 00:59:46.883
<v Mark Sedge>do you know what?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6045-0
00:59:47.003 --> 00:59:49.921
<v Mark Sedge>We're not going to have that office again
next year.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6045-1
00:59:49.921 --> 00:59:53.223
<v Mark Sedge>We're going to move to this office
because that's shocking.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6045-2
00:59:53.223 --> 00:59:57.186
<v Mark Sedge>The traceability of that data,
which is why having the office locations</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6045-3
00:59:57.186 --> 00:59:59.773
<v Mark Sedge>in an asset in the CMDB or that type of
thing,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6045-4
00:59:59.773 --> 01:00:03.131
<v Mark Sedge>you can see how many instance you get
against that location.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6045-5
01:00:03.131 --> 01:00:06.763
<v Mark Sedge>You can start to trend,
where you've got issues where you've got.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6052-0
01:00:06.883 --> 01:00:10.062
<v Mark Sedge>Challenges,
and it might even mean that you switched.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6052-1
01:00:10.062 --> 01:00:14.124
<v Mark Sedge>You know, you might, as I say,
switch the switch the building or you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6052-2
01:00:14.124 --> 01:00:18.009
<v Mark Sedge>might switch out or you,
you know it gives you fact based data to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6052-3
01:00:18.009 --> 01:00:22.071
<v Mark Sedge>which actually feeds into your
organisational accommodation strategy</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6052-4
01:00:22.071 --> 01:00:26.603
<v Mark Sedge>that says actually we keep having these
types of buildings in this location.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6057-0
01:00:26.803 --> 01:00:29.529
<v Mark Sedge>But consistently we can see there's
failures there.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6057-1
01:00:29.529 --> 01:00:31.835
<v Mark Sedge>It doesn't help our partners on the
ground.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6057-2
01:00:31.835 --> 01:00:35.452
<v Mark Sedge>We need to look for this or we need to
centralise those offices now,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6057-3
01:00:35.452 --> 01:00:39.854
<v Mark Sedge>because actually there's greater value in
US doing that and maybe procuring our own</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6057-4
01:00:39.854 --> 01:00:42.003
<v Mark Sedge>yo-yo setup or whatever it happens to be.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6063-0
01:00:43.163 --> 01:00:47.990
<v Mark Sedge>The important piece is you want the date
that operating in a certain way gives you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6063-1
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:52.701
<v Mark Sedge>foundational data which enables you then
to make data different driven decisions</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6063-2
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:56.539
<v Mark Sedge>in terms of what you do, as you know,
in terms of your locations,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6063-3
01:00:56.539 --> 01:00:59.563
<v Mark Sedge>management of those landlords, suppliers,
etcetera.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6065-0
01:01:02.843 --> 01:01:03.643
<v Mark Sedge>Makes sense?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6081-0
01:01:04.599 --> 01:01:08.303
Yeah, that makes sense.
So is that something that we then think

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6081-1
01:01:08.303 --> 01:01:10.039
about for not day one is that?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6084-0
01:01:11.559 --> 01:01:12.199
Your recommendation?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6090-0
01:01:12.563 --> 01:01:16.829
<v Mark Sedge>I I would counsel that there's work.
You know, I don't know whether Alex,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6090-1
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:20.979
<v Mark Sedge>you agree with me, but you know,
because you can say because within the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6090-2
01:01:20.979 --> 01:01:25.014
<v Mark Sedge>system we can sort of say all of these
location assets are, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6090-3
01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:29.453
<v Mark Sedge>over here or managed or these these are
the sites and we can log instance to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6090-4
01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:31.643
<v Mark Sedge>those and anything that goes say to a.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6098-0
01:01:32.003 --> 01:01:36.510
<v Mark Sedge>To the M and EQ or the OPS management Q
or whatever you know is ring fenced for</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6098-1
01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:40.622
<v Mark Sedge>them. So when they go on system,
they only see their records and it only</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6098-2
01:01:40.622 --> 01:01:43.495
<v Mark Sedge>see their we can do all of that lovely
good stuff.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6098-3
01:01:43.495 --> 01:01:47.720
<v Mark Sedge>But for me there's a bit that says I
think there's an opportunity for you.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6098-4
01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:51.043
<v Mark Sedge>I think there's an opportunity one gives
you just greater.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6104-0
01:01:51.723 --> 01:01:56.787
<v Mark Sedge>You know visibility and it's something I
I've seen and done a number of times and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6104-1
01:01:56.787 --> 01:02:01.851
<v Mark Sedge>it and it is absolutely a strong position
for you. So yes, maybe not for day one,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6104-2
01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:06.854
<v Mark Sedge>but I would certainly look at it on from
from on the road map perspective. Alex,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6104-3
01:02:06.854 --> 01:02:10.003
<v Mark Sedge>do you, do you concur,
do you see where I'm going?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6105-0
01:02:10.243 --> 01:02:10.363
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6172-0
01:02:10.479 --> 01:02:14.499
Oh, absolutely. And to your point,
I don't think it's a massive uplift to do.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6172-1
01:02:14.499 --> 01:02:18.829
So I think the key thing for me would be
probably around the data that's, you know,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6120-0
01:02:15.123 --> 01:02:15.203
<v Mark Sedge>Huh.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6172-2
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:22.695
in the background of it and whatever else
we'd we'd need to pull in teams,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6172-3
01:02:22.695 --> 01:02:25.323
for example,
like the people who do all the office

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6172-4
01:02:25.323 --> 01:02:29.344
moves and stuff because keeping that data
accurate and up-to-date and and not

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6172-5
01:02:29.344 --> 01:02:31.199
getting the right data at the start.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6197-0
01:02:31.599 --> 01:02:34.535
But I do think from the queue and logging
point of view,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6197-1
01:02:34.535 --> 01:02:37.831
that's probably a quick one.
The other stuff would be maybe the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6197-2
01:02:37.831 --> 01:02:39.119
vegetable on longer term.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6220-0
01:02:40.759 --> 01:02:43.809
But it's probably when we can have a chat
offline about it,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6201-0
01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:42.123
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6220-1
01:02:43.809 --> 01:02:47.519
mark to see if it's what could you do and
what shouldn't we do for face.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6219-0
01:02:47.203 --> 01:02:48.923
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. Yeah, let's do that.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6230-0
01:02:51.479 --> 01:02:52.719
All right, so good to be cool.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6236-0
01:02:51.679 --> 01:02:55.559
As I say, he is always a rabbit hole here,
so that's why.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6237-0
01:02:55.799 --> 01:02:56.279
I'm sorry, I'm.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6241-0
01:02:58.089 --> 01:02:59.249
Not cheering too loudly.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6242-0
01:02:59.763 --> 01:03:01.003
<v Mark Sedge>Now, OK, I hear you.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6249-0
01:03:02.649 --> 01:03:04.609
For the parking lot, OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6258-0
01:03:06.169 --> 01:03:08.849
Anything else while on this topic,
I'll cover everything I think.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6264-0
01:03:10.689 --> 01:03:12.849
All right. I don't think we need that one.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6291-0
01:03:14.529 --> 01:03:17.554
Pain points.
So these are captured from the original

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6291-1
01:03:17.554 --> 01:03:20.294
call.
I think we've talked about quite a few of

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6291-2
01:03:20.294 --> 01:03:23.490
these today.
Let me know if any of these are incorrect.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6291-3
01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:24.689
So the mobile access.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6300-0
01:03:26.329 --> 01:03:28.809
A real time close out.
That's what we mentioned earlier.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6303-0
01:03:30.479 --> 01:03:31.919
P1 and two.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6315-0
01:03:33.479 --> 01:03:36.914
P2 especially, we talked about,
we don't know what that is in the system

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6315-1
01:03:36.914 --> 01:03:37.479
essentially.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6343-0
01:03:39.319 --> 01:03:44.957
No automatic assignment at the moment.
Do we get into assignment automation in

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6343-1
01:03:44.957 --> 01:03:45.599
solution?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6344-0
01:03:45.599 --> 01:03:47.799
Yeah, we have routing to M&amp;E.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6345-0
01:03:47.799 --> 01:03:49.959
And so we we touch on that a bit good.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6359-0
01:03:51.719 --> 01:03:55.839
Abbreviation of the descriptions for the
Assets asset piece, we'll address that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6371-0
01:03:57.839 --> 01:04:00.959
Clients flagging no compliance flagging.
We've talked about that on the call,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6371-1
01:04:00.959 --> 01:04:01.679
didn't we briefly?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6398-0
01:04:01.669 --> 01:04:04.109
Yeah, we did. Yeah, yeah. Statutory.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6399-0
01:04:04.429 --> 01:04:04.669
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6400-0
01:04:04.829 --> 01:04:07.907
Obligations.
That's that's not identified as such.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6383-0
01:04:05.379 --> 01:04:05.619
So.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6400-1
01:04:07.907 --> 01:04:11.829
So I have to sort of get the bones out of
it every month, right?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6404-0
01:04:11.899 --> 01:04:12.459
Alright, OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6413-0
01:04:13.299 --> 01:04:15.905
So we're saying we're gonna put that in
the system or not putting that in the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6413-1
01:04:15.905 --> 01:04:16.139
system.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6419-0
01:04:15.989 --> 01:04:18.989
Complicated for that,
we thought about that and as his solution.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6423-0
01:04:20.369 --> 01:04:20.489
It.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6428-0
01:04:20.559 --> 01:04:23.119
Clients planning,
I think we have or is it?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6457-0
01:04:23.089 --> 01:04:28.524
We got priority routing and team routing.
I don't think we have compliance packing.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6457-1
01:04:28.524 --> 01:04:32.471
We've got for the PPM.
We have a checkbox or a drop down for

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6457-2
01:04:32.471 --> 01:04:34.089
kind of regulatory items.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6499-0
01:04:35.849 --> 01:04:38.457
Would that work? Yeah, I think so.
But once we get into,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6459-0
01:04:37.003 --> 01:04:37.123
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6499-1
01:04:38.457 --> 01:04:41.843
we can always adjust the solution to see
if it works. If it doesn't work,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6499-2
01:04:41.843 --> 01:04:42.849
could it be like eaps?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6500-0
01:04:43.929 --> 01:04:47.161
We've been so many workshops.
Could it be like E billing where you have

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6500-1
01:04:47.161 --> 01:04:50.169
that you know when we said we wanted like
proactive scheduling or?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6508-0
01:04:51.129 --> 01:04:54.249
Where it tells you like. Oh,
for compliance. This is due at this day.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6511-0
01:04:55.689 --> 01:04:56.689
I tried that by.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6531-0
01:04:56.269 --> 01:05:00.753
Just. Yeah, I don't know. Well, you know,
we've been so many of these workshops.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6531-1
01:05:00.753 --> 01:05:03.189
Is there some ideas we can nick from
other?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6545-0
01:05:03.883 --> 01:05:06.720
<v Mark Sedge>Well,
there's there's core functionality in the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6539-0
01:05:04.839 --> 01:05:05.799
It's a third type.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6540-0
01:05:06.359 --> 01:05:06.879
And sneak.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6545-1
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.380
<v Mark Sedge>sense that you can classify a record,
right?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6545-2
01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:13.103
<v Mark Sedge>So if the if it's a scheduled activity
that is for compliance,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6545-3
01:05:13.103 --> 01:05:17.890
<v Mark Sedge>you can you can record you basically you
can set that up so that every time that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6545-4
01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:20.904
<v Mark Sedge>fires there's a compliance category
applied to it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6545-5
01:05:20.904 --> 01:05:23.563
<v Mark Sedge>One could be routine maintenance,
one could.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6550-0
01:05:23.643 --> 01:05:27.945
<v Mark Sedge>Could be compliance.
One could be what are the other options</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6550-1
01:05:27.945 --> 01:05:32.034
<v Mark Sedge>you might have?
Like you know you know ad hoc or whatever</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6550-2
01:05:32.034 --> 01:05:36.335
<v Mark Sedge>you know you you you would drive those by
from the schedule.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6550-3
01:05:36.335 --> 01:05:38.803
<v Mark Sedge>So actually if you knew which ones.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6557-0
01:05:39.243 --> 01:05:44.152
<v Mark Sedge>Were statutory from the off that you at
the point of scheduling when that task</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6557-1
01:05:44.152 --> 01:05:47.259
<v Mark Sedge>got generated,
if we knew that and we tracked it,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6554-0
01:05:44.339 --> 01:05:44.499
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6557-2
01:05:47.259 --> 01:05:52.043
<v Mark Sedge>we'd we'd just classify the record and
then you just run a report to say how</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6557-3
01:05:52.043 --> 01:05:55.647
<v Mark Sedge>many were categorised as statutory,
you know, tasks Bosh.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6557-4
01:05:55.647 --> 01:05:58.443
<v Mark Sedge>There's your report of how many you've
done.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6566-0
01:05:59.299 --> 01:06:01.259
Yep, it's valid, though. Yeah. Yeah, sure.
I'm.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6571-0
01:05:59.869 --> 01:06:04.709
Yeah, cool.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6567-0
01:06:01.779 --> 01:06:02.299
Pretty sure we.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6572-0
01:06:04.369 --> 01:06:04.689
Thank you.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6593-0
01:06:06.489 --> 01:06:08.950
Mobile experience we mentioned manual
reporting.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6584-0
01:06:08.689 --> 01:06:09.209
Four things.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6593-1
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:12.969
So those reports are manual at the moment.
Are they provided just capture that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6598-0
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:15.049
Mobile report.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6609-0
01:06:15.469 --> 01:06:16.429
Sorry the the manual.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6607-0
01:06:16.599 --> 01:06:16.919
Main reporting.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6610-0
01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:19.189
Yeah, so these reports.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6639-0
01:06:20.599 --> 01:06:23.560
Shows plan,
so it's it's probably this reporting tool

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6639-1
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:27.399
shows completed BPM tasks kind of can't
imagine that's manual, is it?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6640-0
01:06:27.799 --> 01:06:29.439
It's more the Reactives manual, isn't it?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6647-0
01:06:30.209 --> 01:06:31.209
Oh, right.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6655-0
01:06:31.009 --> 01:06:34.232
Because sometimes they go direct.
So that's a list of them as well as come

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6655-1
01:06:34.232 --> 01:06:35.049
through as connect.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6663-0
01:06:36.729 --> 01:06:38.169
OK, cool. We can we can.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6697-0
01:06:37.569 --> 01:06:42.518
You can't extract the beat up from Cheryl.
Last one's data and completed task,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6697-1
01:06:42.518 --> 01:06:45.588
but it's not great.
That's definitely not great,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6681-0
01:06:45.059 --> 01:06:45.739
Alright, that's fine.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6697-2
01:06:45.588 --> 01:06:47.969
and it's not trustworthy, right? Well.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6698-0
01:06:48.169 --> 01:06:50.009
We'll look at some of the reports that we
propose.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6705-0
01:06:50.299 --> 01:06:52.099
Why say what you make? It's like so yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6719-0
01:06:52.409 --> 01:06:56.169
What?
What I what I do for for my reporting to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6719-1
01:06:56.169 --> 01:06:56.489
Sam.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6725-0
01:06:57.279 --> 01:06:58.439
It's literally just counter.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6740-0
01:07:00.839 --> 01:07:04.619
How many we've done so it needs to
generate, you know,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6740-1
01:07:04.619 --> 01:07:06.199
some some yes and some.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6746-0
01:07:06.739 --> 01:07:08.899
Yeah, I really.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6741-0
01:07:06.923 --> 01:07:08.843
<v Mark Sedge>But the idea would be that you wouldn't
have to do.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6747-0
01:07:09.279 --> 01:07:10.559
It would automatically.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6750-0
01:07:11.603 --> 01:07:13.723
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
the the idea would be Sam would be able</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6750-1
01:07:13.723 --> 01:07:17.318
<v Mark Sedge>to self help from just having a data,
a wiki or something on a dashboard that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6750-2
01:07:17.318 --> 01:07:20.083
<v Mark Sedge>told her the answer without you even
having to do anything.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6752-0
01:07:21.299 --> 01:07:21.499
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6766-0
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:23.469
Alright. I mean going.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6767-0
01:07:23.469 --> 01:07:24.549
Through these, I think there's lot.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6768-0
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:26.205
Of value out.
We're gonna gonna get from this.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6768-1
01:07:26.205 --> 01:07:26.909
So it's pretty good.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6789-0
01:07:28.439 --> 01:07:30.874
Capacity tracking,
I think you said that's not captured at

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6789-1
01:07:30.874 --> 01:07:32.938
the moment,
that'll be be a part of this as well.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6789-2
01:07:32.938 --> 01:07:34.919
Say number of tasks and what not.
That's right.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6795-0
01:07:37.039 --> 01:07:38.839
Duplicate systems.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6821-0
01:07:40.439 --> 01:07:42.814
Yeah,
the e-mail piece I think is perhaps 11

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6821-1
01:07:42.814 --> 01:07:45.768
for a parking lot of what we do with the
mailbox. Mark,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6821-2
01:07:45.768 --> 01:07:47.879
I know you'll be interested in that one.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6822-0
01:07:48.479 --> 01:07:48.599
The.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6823-0
01:07:48.599 --> 01:07:51.239
Existing mailbox triggering cases.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6829-0
01:07:51.923 --> 01:07:54.686
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
the the the key point here will be that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6829-1
01:07:54.686 --> 01:07:57.689
<v Mark Sedge>currently there's a, yeah,
just for the audience,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6829-2
01:07:57.689 --> 01:08:02.194
<v Mark Sedge>there's like 32 odd different e-mail
boxes firing tickets into Cherwell in</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6829-3
01:08:02.194 --> 01:08:06.639
<v Mark Sedge>various states of quality and randomness.
What we're trying to do is say,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6829-4
01:08:06.639 --> 01:08:10.603
<v Mark Sedge>and which is why I asked the question,
that if all of your users.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6834-0
01:08:11.443 --> 01:08:15.052
<v Mark Sedge>And requesters are internal.
Then there should be no reason why they</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6834-1
01:08:15.052 --> 01:08:19.131
<v Mark Sedge>wouldn't be driven into the portal,
and therefore you that enables us to turn</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6834-2
01:08:19.131 --> 01:08:23.524
<v Mark Sedge>off some of those Cherwell e-mail or that
particular e-mail address because you say</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6834-3
01:08:23.524 --> 01:08:27.603
<v Mark Sedge>you don't need that anymore because
you're going to direct everybody to that.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6841-0
01:08:28.843 --> 01:08:32.854
<v Mark Sedge>You know to the portal so the
organisational change would be for your</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6841-1
01:08:32.854 --> 01:08:35.776
<v Mark Sedge>audience.
So you'll no longer be to send an e-mail</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6841-2
01:08:35.776 --> 01:08:38.812
<v Mark Sedge>into here,
you'll do it via this form in the portal.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6841-3
01:08:38.812 --> 01:08:43.396
<v Mark Sedge>You just sever that link and then that's
something that we haven't got to build</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6841-4
01:08:43.396 --> 01:08:44.083
<v Mark Sedge>and develop.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6848-0
01:08:44.443 --> 01:08:48.741
<v Mark Sedge>You know to enable you to move forwards
now it might be that you go. Actually no,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6848-1
01:08:48.741 --> 01:08:52.042
<v Mark Sedge>we do need that as a backstop and then if
so we know about it,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6848-2
01:08:52.042 --> 01:08:54.977
<v Mark Sedge>we know what we're building.
But at the end of the day,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6848-3
01:08:54.977 --> 01:08:57.859
<v Mark Sedge>that won't be as rich as what you'd get
from the form.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6848-4
01:08:57.859 --> 01:09:02.209
<v Mark Sedge>And then what you can potentially look at
is you might put a message or auto reply</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6848-5
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:04.043
<v Mark Sedge>on that e-mail when they submit it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6853-0
01:09:04.443 --> 01:09:07.927
<v Mark Sedge>Or some sort of indication that says if
you submit it by e-mail,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6853-1
01:09:07.927 --> 01:09:12.267
<v Mark Sedge>you won't get as fast a response as if
you use the portal and then you drive the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6853-2
01:09:12.267 --> 01:09:15.643
<v Mark Sedge>behaviour by service quality. Again.
Something to think about.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6897-0
01:09:17.899 --> 01:09:20.439
Definite a different value out of the
system,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6897-1
01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:23.477
and that's kind of the same as one low
direct contact.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6897-2
01:09:23.477 --> 01:09:26.956
So push them towards the portal and no
customer communication.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6897-3
01:09:26.956 --> 01:09:30.877
I I captured there of the call.
So as I said and we can look at this a

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6897-4
01:09:30.877 --> 01:09:33.859
little bit later if we if you want to see
a demo but.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6925-0
01:09:34.719 --> 01:09:38.133
If the request has raised the task,
they'll be able to check on the status of

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6925-1
01:09:38.133 --> 01:09:41.679
it and be able to respond to them and
have more of a chat than a back and forth.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6964-0
01:09:40.889 --> 01:09:44.006
Yeah, it's closing the loop,
isn't it really? I mean,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6964-1
01:09:44.006 --> 01:09:48.507
I do ask my guys to make sure that they
go back and speak to the customer and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6943-0
01:09:48.119 --> 01:09:48.359
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6964-2
01:09:48.507 --> 01:09:52.201
make sure they're happy.
Don't lose that interaction. But yeah,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6964-3
01:09:52.201 --> 01:09:56.529
generating something to see what's been
done is quite important, isn't it?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6965-0
01:09:56.689 --> 01:09:58.049
Yeah, we'll show you how that looks.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6970-0
01:09:58.849 --> 01:10:00.009
So front and back.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6971-0
01:10:00.449 --> 01:10:00.689
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6976-0
01:10:02.529 --> 01:10:02.969
Yeah, I think.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6992-0
01:10:03.119 --> 01:10:05.951
Gonna be able to address quite a lot of
these. It's it's quite good.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/6992-1
01:10:05.951 --> 01:10:09.399
Is there anything else top of mind top of
your mind? That's not in this list, that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7019-0
01:10:18.259 --> 01:10:18.459
No.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7020-0
01:10:19.019 --> 01:10:21.241
OK,
I think it's good time for a break and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7020-1
01:10:21.241 --> 01:10:21.499
then.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7021-0
01:10:21.499 --> 01:10:24.459
We'll look at data clean up,
but it's it's not as plain as.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7022-0
01:10:24.459 --> 01:10:24.859
It sounds.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7056-0
01:10:26.439 --> 01:10:29.032
I put in the agenda an extended break
here.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7056-1
01:10:29.032 --> 01:10:33.688
I think some people may have booked in
calls and things, so like half an hour.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7056-2
01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:36.400
So let's go with that one and then we'll
try.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7056-3
01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.759
And how do at the end through the
solution and those up.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7060-0
01:10:41.323 --> 01:10:43.923
<v Mark Sedge>So back 11:45, Josh. Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7058-0
01:10:41.339 --> 01:10:42.219
I could go to 12.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7069-0
01:10:43.359 --> 01:10:45.759
Yeah, yeah, good maths.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7070-0
01:10:46.879 --> 01:10:47.559
1:45.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7068-0
01:10:47.203 --> 01:10:48.883
<v Mark Sedge>Very good. Thank you very much.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7067-0
01:10:47.363 --> 01:10:48.123
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Great. Thanks.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7074-0
01:10:49.069 --> 01:10:49.549
Thanks so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7073-0
01:10:49.399 --> 01:10:49.719
Thank you.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7077-0
01:10:50.269 --> 01:10:50.789
Thank you.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7080-0
01:10:53.319 --> 01:10:53.919
I might get much.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7081-0
01:10:53.589 --> 01:10:53.949
Go, go.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7603-0
01:44:34.083 --> 01:44:37.243
<v Mark Sedge>I can't hear what you're saying,
but the actions speak volumes.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7606-0
01:44:37.519 --> 01:44:38.359
And so he looks good.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7610-0
01:44:39.043 --> 01:44:42.123
<v Mark Sedge>I was going to say luckily only lasts a
month.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7607-0
01:44:40.749 --> 01:44:40.909
Well.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7613-0
01:44:45.769 --> 01:44:47.289
That's amazing. See if you can hear.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7619-0
01:44:48.189 --> 01:44:49.429
You hear? It's OK up. Come here.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7620-0
01:44:50.443 --> 01:44:51.323
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, I can hear you.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7621-0
01:44:51.883 --> 01:44:52.883
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yep, got yours now.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7624-0
01:44:53.679 --> 01:44:53.959
You.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7626-0
01:44:55.249 --> 01:44:55.769
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7631-0
01:44:58.069 --> 01:44:59.389
Kick off again in a moment.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7682-0
01:45:18.139 --> 01:45:19.659
Right this this bit.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7683-0
01:45:19.739 --> 01:45:23.397
On data we were able to get some of the
high level data in the system.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7683-1
01:45:23.397 --> 01:45:26.436
Just look at the categories and types and
stuff like that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7683-2
01:45:26.436 --> 01:45:29.939
Just wanted to flash it up on screen.
Really just kind of give you.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7683-3
01:45:29.939 --> 01:45:33.339
Is this still up today? Is it?
Is this something we want to move?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7723-0
01:45:34.739 --> 01:45:35.059
Or do we?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7724-0
01:45:35.059 --> 01:45:40.561
Want to take this opportunity to clean it
up or change it wouldn't do it right now

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7724-1
01:45:40.561 --> 01:45:43.876
in the session,
but that's what we do afterwards.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7724-2
01:45:43.876 --> 01:45:47.389
So teams wise,
this is what we captured as as teams.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7724-3
01:45:47.389 --> 01:45:51.499
Let us know if any of these are now
defunct or not needed or.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7726-0
01:45:53.429 --> 01:45:54.189
That makes sense.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7760-0
01:45:59.939 --> 01:46:00.099
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7761-0
01:46:00.099 --> 01:46:02.160
It seems it's.
I think when you actually see it in

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7761-1
01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:05.271
context, then we might say actually no,
there's something else that might be

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7752-0
01:46:04.999 --> 01:46:05.479
OK. Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7761-2
01:46:05.271 --> 01:46:08.139
added to change. But yeah, from that,
that they're all still relevant.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7764-0
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:09.749
Yep, still relevant. OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7770-0
01:46:11.309 --> 01:46:14.189
Categories. They're broken down for these.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7810-0
01:46:23.259 --> 01:46:25.139
What are these used for these categories?
What?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7811-0
01:46:25.459 --> 01:46:28.164
Are these extracted from the surface?
Yeah, it's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7811-1
01:46:28.164 --> 01:46:32.599
It's from the ticket type and share. Well,
and this is what's going to be used in

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7811-2
01:46:32.599 --> 01:46:35.899
the proposed solution to drive the
routing and the priority.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7853-0
01:46:37.459 --> 01:46:40.841
I think this is what we're not expecting
you to have. The answers at the moment.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7827-0
01:46:39.929 --> 01:46:40.169
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7853-1
01:46:40.841 --> 01:46:44.014
It's just kind of a high level this we
haven't system if you want to have a

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7853-2
01:46:44.014 --> 01:46:46.478
review afterwards.
I think the next slide is probably more

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7853-3
01:46:46.478 --> 01:46:47.939
relevant to the general cleanup we.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7860-0
01:46:47.869 --> 01:46:50.669
I did notice on this one we got cooling
and heating and heating and cooling.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7867-0
01:46:53.819 --> 01:46:54.539
Probably 1.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7873-0
01:46:54.269 --> 01:46:56.069
That's quite normal with chairwo.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7874-0
01:46:56.219 --> 01:46:56.379
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7922-0
01:46:58.459 --> 01:47:01.879
Stuff like lockers, lockers,
other other toilet repairs. It's not,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7922-1
01:47:01.879 --> 01:47:04.891
it's not. I guess urgent.
Urgent to do the implementation,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7922-2
01:47:04.891 --> 01:47:07.444
but obviously if you guys clean it up in
advance,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7922-3
01:47:07.444 --> 01:47:10.813
then the data that you have in the system
is a lot more accurate.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7922-4
01:47:10.813 --> 01:47:13.059
Your report is more accurate your
workflow.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7943-0
01:47:14.099 --> 01:47:17.344
Are overall better,
so it's just to put it on your radar that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7943-1
01:47:17.344 --> 01:47:21.059
this is an ideal thing to do before we
start doing the implementation.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7992-0
01:47:22.489 --> 01:47:27.611
Yeah, it wasn't a hard exercise to take.
It's just a view on when we get to add in

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7992-1
01:47:27.611 --> 01:47:31.129
the data in then might want to clean up
and have a look.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7993-0
01:47:31.129 --> 01:47:34.006
Do you want to get a copy of that at some
point just so I can send it out to a few

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7993-1
01:47:34.006 --> 01:47:35.705
different teams just for them to sense
check it,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/7993-2
01:47:35.705 --> 01:47:37.369
so make sure I've got missing out on
something.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8010-0
01:47:37.839 --> 01:47:42.919
Coffee machine. That's not on there.
I can't see it. That's that's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8005-0
01:47:39.269 --> 01:47:40.349
Is alma. It's an honour.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8012-0
01:47:42.669 --> 01:47:44.429
Looks like sorry.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8015-0
01:47:47.083 --> 01:47:49.765
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Can I just double check?
Did we say this was all lifted from</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8015-1
01:47:49.765 --> 01:47:52.403
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>sharewell? Is that right?
What's existing in there already?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8022-0
01:47:54.323 --> 01:47:56.534
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>OK.
I'm just wondering from a service</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8022-1
01:47:56.534 --> 01:48:00.256
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>catalogue perspective,
do we need to do that alignment piece as</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8022-2
01:48:00.256 --> 01:48:02.816
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>well,
maybe not at this sub category level?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8022-3
01:48:02.816 --> 01:48:07.353
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I don't know what's captured in the
service catalogue for your teams. Ashley,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8022-4
01:48:07.353 --> 01:48:09.912
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Sam,
have you has that been covered for you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8022-5
01:48:09.912 --> 01:48:10.203
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>guys?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8048-0
01:48:13.949 --> 01:48:15.962
Oh,
remember that we mentioned a few years

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8048-1
01:48:15.962 --> 01:48:18.068
ago,
but I don't remember what happened with

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8048-2
01:48:18.068 --> 01:48:20.127
it.
If it actually went forward or not with

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8048-3
01:48:20.127 --> 01:48:23.029
the catalogue from our side,
I'll have to check in with Rosa.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8053-0
01:48:23.883 --> 01:48:26.178
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>OK,
let me have a look at the actual copy of</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8053-1
01:48:26.178 --> 01:48:30.054
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>the service catalogue that we've got and
see if you guys are on it and I'll</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8053-2
01:48:30.054 --> 01:48:33.216
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>circulate with you as if I can find that
you are on it there.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8053-3
01:48:33.216 --> 01:48:36.633
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>But I think we just want to align as I
say maybe not sub category,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8053-4
01:48:36.633 --> 01:48:40.203
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>but the levels above that if we're going
through the employee centre.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8052-0
01:48:40.003 --> 01:48:40.163
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8058-0
01:48:42.163 --> 01:48:46.126
<v Mark Sedge>Quick question from our spotted printer
issues and folks are they not?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8058-1
01:48:46.126 --> 01:48:46.963
<v Mark Sedge>Is that not IT?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8092-0
01:48:47.749 --> 01:48:49.751
No,
the first line will be the floor

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8092-1
01:48:49.751 --> 01:48:52.728
ambassadors.
We'll check them first and guide Xerox to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8066-0
01:48:51.203 --> 01:48:51.803
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8092-2
01:48:52.728 --> 01:48:55.596
get the, you know,
liaise with them then if it's the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8092-3
01:48:55.596 --> 01:48:57.977
software issue,
then it's or it's hardware.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8091-0
01:48:57.203 --> 01:49:00.043
<v Mark Sedge>Gotcha, right. Yeah. OK, understood.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8092-4
01:48:57.977 --> 01:48:59.709
One of them's IT. One of them's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8100-0
01:49:03.323 --> 01:49:07.743
<v Mark Sedge>That's interesting actually.
So if if the item so we we just need to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8100-1
01:49:07.743 --> 01:49:12.163
<v Mark Sedge>sort work that one through.
So the IT if someone contacts IT say the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8100-2
01:49:12.163 --> 01:49:16.262
<v Mark Sedge>printer isn't working,
how does your IT will then do what would</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8100-3
01:49:16.262 --> 01:49:21.258
<v Mark Sedge>they speak to you guys in connect or
would they would they want to engage the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8100-4
01:49:21.258 --> 01:49:22.923
<v Mark Sedge>team on the floor someone.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8102-0
01:49:22.963 --> 01:49:26.923
<v Mark Sedge>On the floor to go and look at that
machine, how would that work in practise?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8149-0
01:49:28.039 --> 01:49:31.122
It would probably go to the front and say
Yep,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8149-1
01:49:31.122 --> 01:49:36.435
but it's not as it's flooring basters and
then they would let them know it's the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8149-2
01:49:36.435 --> 01:49:39.715
flooring basters or it would be askinx to
triage,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8149-3
01:49:39.715 --> 01:49:44.766
so they would probably be or or they
should know what they do and they don't

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8137-0
01:49:39.723 --> 01:49:40.883
<v Mark Sedge>OK, well.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8149-4
01:49:44.766 --> 01:49:45.159
do so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8196-0
01:49:45.899 --> 01:49:47.899
And generally the floor ambassadors are
on the floor,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8196-1
01:49:47.899 --> 01:49:50.824
so they will check the printers they
should know before anyone else if there's

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8196-2
01:49:50.824 --> 01:49:53.713
an issue because they should be checking
them throughout the day so they will

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8196-3
01:49:53.713 --> 01:49:56.009
highlight an issue and then ring Xerox up.
If it's a problem.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8183-0
01:49:54.043 --> 01:49:54.563
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8196-4
01:49:56.009 --> 01:49:58.379
And then obviously then liaise with
myself or my colleague Lee.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8240-0
01:49:59.059 --> 01:50:01.739
And then towards IT,
if it's not a Xerox issue.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8241-0
01:50:02.499 --> 01:50:04.784
But there's a bit of historical stuff
here,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8205-0
01:50:02.523 --> 01:50:02.883
<v Mark Sedge>Got you.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8241-1
01:50:04.784 --> 01:50:08.679
mark around the way the contracts are set
up and whatever else the printer

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8213-0
01:50:05.003 --> 01:50:05.523
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8241-2
01:50:08.679 --> 01:50:11.899
contracts are set under buildings and
facilities rather than.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8247-0
01:50:11.323 --> 01:50:14.121
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, just. Yeah.
Because the reason I was asking is</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8242-0
01:50:11.899 --> 01:50:13.259
I but that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8247-1
01:50:14.121 --> 01:50:17.025
<v Mark Sedge>because you, you,
they it might all materialise us and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8247-2
01:50:17.025 --> 01:50:21.301
<v Mark Sedge>having you know be familiar with some of
these things like you know whether it's</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8247-3
01:50:21.301 --> 01:50:24.468
<v Mark Sedge>cereals contract,
Konica or whoever you can have situations</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8247-4
01:50:24.468 --> 01:50:26.950
<v Mark Sedge>where you call them out they get out to
sight,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8247-5
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:30.803
<v Mark Sedge>they look at it go this is an issue with
your print server or something.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8258-0
01:50:30.923 --> 01:50:34.585
<v Mark Sedge>That actually is an IT issue.
Typically you want it to be triaging all</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8258-1
01:50:34.585 --> 01:50:38.247
<v Mark Sedge>of the bits that we're accountable for
before you engage the supplier,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8258-2
01:50:38.247 --> 01:50:42.373
<v Mark Sedge>because otherwise you spend money on a
call out depending on what your contract</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8258-3
01:50:42.373 --> 01:50:43.043
<v Mark Sedge>setup is. So.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8297-0
01:50:42.719 --> 01:50:45.395
Yeah, we don't have to call outs.
We actually do on the phone.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8297-1
01:50:45.395 --> 01:50:47.519
So it's it's done very much.
The Xerox tell them.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8298-0
01:50:47.519 --> 01:50:47.679
What?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8299-0
01:50:47.679 --> 01:50:51.737
To check they do two or three different
things, and if it's not then they'll know.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8299-1
01:50:51.737 --> 01:50:54.475
If it's Xerox,
or if it's IT issue and then we escalate

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8299-2
01:50:54.475 --> 01:50:55.599
it either way. So it's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8302-0
01:50:56.283 --> 01:50:59.986
<v Mark Sedge>So in that situation,
would you then raise a ticket on IT via</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8300-0
01:50:57.219 --> 01:50:57.259
A.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8302-1
01:50:59.986 --> 01:51:00.643
<v Mark Sedge>the portal?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8304-0
01:51:01.249 --> 01:51:01.609
Yes.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8305-0
01:51:02.563 --> 01:51:04.283
<v Mark Sedge>It would. It would. OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8307-0
01:51:02.659 --> 01:51:02.819
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8314-0
01:51:04.769 --> 01:51:06.289
And then obviously then we only have off.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8331-0
01:51:07.479 --> 01:51:09.338
Of the portal conversations with certain
people,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8331-1
01:51:09.338 --> 01:51:11.879
try and push things along as quickly as
we can to get it resolved.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8336-0
01:51:12.163 --> 01:51:15.270
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, it feels, yeah.
Just when I look at that, that,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8336-1
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:19.700
<v Mark Sedge>that just sort of feels and really do
forgive me for saying this feels a bit</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8336-2
01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:24.130
<v Mark Sedge>clunky when, you know, depend you,
you want a common routine so you can move</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8336-3
01:51:24.130 --> 01:51:28.963
<v Mark Sedge>that ticket without having to create new
tickets and things like that for your own.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8338-0
01:51:30.203 --> 01:51:31.763
<v Mark Sedge>We might, you know.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8380-0
01:51:32.829 --> 01:51:36.583
The IT that actually is changing soon,
so there's a massive global project,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8422-0
01:51:32.899 --> 01:51:36.379
It actually is changing soon,
so there's a massive global project,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8386-0
01:51:35.369 --> 01:51:35.649
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8349-0
01:51:35.479 --> 01:51:35.679
Yes.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8422-1
01:51:36.379 --> 01:51:39.339
so that will be all different.
The way we'll be working.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8380-1
01:51:36.583 --> 01:51:39.349
so that will be all different the way
we'll be working.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8423-0
01:51:39.339 --> 01:51:42.027
Isn't it? Yeah.
So there's a new there's a global print

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8423-1
01:51:42.027 --> 01:51:44.331
project which is running and it's part of
that,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8423-2
01:51:44.331 --> 01:51:47.595
the contracts and stuff will move into
Simon's world. So, you know,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8421-0
01:51:47.483 --> 01:51:52.151
<v Mark Sedge>OK. So we're we're,
so we will get swept up when another</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8423-3
01:51:47.595 --> 01:51:49.899
printers will be that whole printer
management.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8421-1
01:51:52.151 --> 01:51:54.443
<v Mark Sedge>global project materialises.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8425-0
01:51:55.043 --> 01:51:55.163
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8433-0
01:51:55.269 --> 01:52:02.149
Ment Simon Wallace so as organisational
take on.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8427-0
01:51:55.429 --> 01:51:55.589
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8444-0
01:52:02.163 --> 01:52:08.243
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, it's a desk side desk. Yeah. Yeah.
OK, now that answers that. Thank you.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8441-0
01:52:02.779 --> 01:52:05.659
And also as part of that whole workplace
piece.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8449-0
01:52:08.209 --> 01:52:09.809
What is?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8444-1
01:52:08.243 --> 01:52:09.243
<v Mark Sedge>I'll shut up.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8469-0
01:52:10.809 --> 01:52:11.889
Just a comment on this.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8446-0
01:52:10.963 --> 01:52:11.083
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8470-0
01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:14.289
It's in process. Just some of these.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8471-0
01:52:14.289 --> 01:52:17.889
Actually connector.
So like car park cycle car parking.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8479-0
01:52:19.629 --> 01:52:21.149
So car park in the cycle storage.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8493-0
01:52:22.869 --> 01:52:26.351
Yeah, yeah, but security.
I didn't know security even used this

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8493-1
01:52:26.351 --> 01:52:26.949
chair well.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8503-0
01:52:27.909 --> 01:52:29.269
I thought they did her, I thought.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8502-0
01:52:28.949 --> 01:52:29.829
Can I believe? Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8532-0
01:52:31.549 --> 01:52:32.789
Do they have access to it?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8533-0
01:52:32.909 --> 01:52:34.389
They have they have access but.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8534-0
01:52:34.389 --> 01:52:35.509
I've never known them to use.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8535-0
01:52:35.509 --> 01:52:38.550
It so it all comes through emails.
If someone says I'm linked into their

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8531-0
01:52:37.579 --> 01:52:39.779
More. Mm-hmm. Yep.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8535-1
01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:40.549
e-mail boxes. So yeah,
it comes through emails.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8556-0
01:52:41.709 --> 01:52:45.742
Because these categories were created on
the basis that all these teams were going

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8556-1
01:52:45.742 --> 01:52:48.269
to be on sharewell and it turned out that
that was.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8596-0
01:52:50.949 --> 01:52:54.614
So at the time, because there was,
I think it was like they were offered

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8596-1
01:52:54.614 --> 01:52:57.576
that and then it just didn't suit their
needs at the time.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8596-2
01:52:57.576 --> 01:53:01.794
So that's why they never went on farewell.
And I think This is why we have a shared

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8596-3
01:53:01.794 --> 01:53:03.149
share well with facilities.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8601-0
01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:06.069
OK. Yeah. That makes sense actually.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8620-0
01:53:07.629 --> 01:53:12.678
But is is it involved? Thank you.
Is it a case of when if it's a security

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8620-1
01:53:12.678 --> 01:53:14.589
item, you would select that?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8658-0
01:53:16.269 --> 01:53:20.709
For the car park and cycle storage again
was just added at the beginning,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8658-1
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:22.269
but so I I would probably.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8659-0
01:53:22.549 --> 01:53:24.589
Remove that because.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8661-0
01:53:24.589 --> 01:53:27.364
It's.
You're duplicating it because we have it

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8661-1
01:53:27.364 --> 01:53:30.317
anyway,
and the process for cycle parking and car

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8661-2
01:53:30.317 --> 01:53:30.789
parking.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8682-0
01:53:31.829 --> 01:53:34.869
And you've got locker and lockers again.
Let me security, wouldn't it?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8674-0
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.589
Yes.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8683-0
01:53:35.349 --> 01:53:37.749
And lost and stolen.
Stolen quite a few things there, isn't it?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8696-0
01:53:39.059 --> 01:53:39.659
The system I.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8686-0
01:53:39.689 --> 01:53:40.249
Yes.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8697-0
01:53:41.219 --> 01:53:43.819
Think on on in the solution we have
another.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8702-0
01:53:45.749 --> 01:53:46.389
Description field.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8741-0
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:53.549
That removes the sub category,
so just go straight into the description

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8741-1
01:53:53.549 --> 01:53:54.749
so text box and.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8715-0
01:53:53.979 --> 01:53:54.219
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8742-0
01:53:54.749 --> 01:53:59.656
We can use the data from other if there's
other things been requested that we can

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8742-1
01:53:59.656 --> 01:54:02.349
add into that category to capture later,
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8751-0
01:54:01.539 --> 01:54:04.328
We'll go through when we go. Yeah,
we have a open description.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8751-1
01:54:04.328 --> 01:54:06.099
So if there's any, that's whatever they.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8752-0
01:54:05.483 --> 01:54:09.229
<v Mark Sedge>I was gonna say I'm assuming the windows
one depends on whether you're inside or</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8752-1
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:10.523
<v Mark Sedge>outside the building, right?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8754-0
01:54:12.643 --> 01:54:12.763
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8760-0
01:54:15.719 --> 01:54:17.319
Yes, definitely cleaned up, isn't it?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8776-0
01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:21.069
Clean up your hand but yeah, alright,
I think.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8762-0
01:54:19.003 --> 01:54:19.123
<v Mark Sedge>Good.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8777-0
01:54:22.029 --> 01:54:25.629
It was good to to look through any who,
but let's get into.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8788-0
01:54:26.829 --> 01:54:31.309
And what we think is going look like
Marwan over to you, Sir.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8793-0
01:54:31.389 --> 01:54:31.589
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8832-0
01:54:32.949 --> 01:54:36.209
So just a caveat,
this isn't the definitive this is in the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8832-1
01:54:36.209 --> 01:54:39.523
kind of we're doing this full stop.
We're open to feedback,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8832-2
01:54:39.523 --> 01:54:41.954
we want to align it with your
requirements.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8832-3
01:54:41.954 --> 01:54:46.318
This is what we've understood based on
the as is processes and the information

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8832-4
01:54:46.318 --> 01:54:47.589
we've just reviewed so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8858-0
01:54:48.509 --> 01:54:51.061
We've broken it down into four different
categories,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8858-1
01:54:51.061 --> 01:54:53.805
so we have appm dedicated area where as
we said earlier,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8858-2
01:54:53.805 --> 01:54:56.309
you'll be able to be able to adjust your
schedules.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8896-0
01:54:57.029 --> 01:54:59.695
We have accommodated for being able to
add in new PPM.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8896-1
01:54:59.695 --> 01:55:02.264
Scheduled items can add or remove that as
necessary,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8896-2
01:55:02.264 --> 01:55:05.705
but we just thought it's useful in case
they do come up in the future.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8896-3
01:55:05.705 --> 01:55:09.389
We don't have to make any changes,
it's just future proofs it a little bit.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8950-0
01:55:10.949 --> 01:55:15.292
Front facing portal. So as we said,
we want your form intake to be available

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8950-1
01:55:15.292 --> 01:55:19.804
to users internally and it just kind of
helps to move away from the emails even

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8950-2
01:55:19.804 --> 01:55:24.373
if in phase one we're still doing emails
for the majority at least you have that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8950-3
01:55:24.373 --> 01:55:29.054
facility within ServiceNow to be able to
raise issues and to be able to raise your

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8950-4
01:55:29.054 --> 01:55:30.069
reactive requests.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/8962-0
01:55:30.659 --> 01:55:30.979
And.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9014-0
01:55:30.939 --> 01:55:33.592
Agent workspace.
That's just your dedicated area within

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9014-1
01:55:33.592 --> 01:55:35.770
ServiceNow where you can manage your
tickets.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9014-2
01:55:35.770 --> 01:55:39.465
You could put philtres over them and
where the reports are going to be driven

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9014-3
01:55:39.465 --> 01:55:41.502
from.
In essence to pull the data and then

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9014-4
01:55:41.502 --> 01:55:44.107
e-mail expiration.
So there's the idea was we have a 2

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9014-5
01:55:44.107 --> 01:55:47.233
phased approach. Phase one,
we have e-mail integrations when they

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9014-6
01:55:47.233 --> 01:55:50.880
come in through to your group e-mail,
they're just automatically created the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9014-7
01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:51.259
tickets.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9042-0
01:55:51.699 --> 01:55:54.305
And you also have the option of front
facing port to.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9042-1
01:55:54.305 --> 01:55:58.118
So if you want to get that change piece
started you have two ways of doing it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9042-2
01:55:58.118 --> 01:56:00.579
So it's not too much of A change for the
existing.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9045-0
01:56:02.959 --> 01:56:03.279
Yep.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9052-0
01:56:05.009 --> 01:56:06.849
Any questions so far on the approach or?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9070-0
01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:14.669
So this is just a mock up and the fields
that I've suggested potentially.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9118-0
01:56:16.549 --> 01:56:19.571
We've got your facilities,
category of facilities,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9118-1
01:56:19.571 --> 01:56:23.777
subcategories that's based on the
previous slides where your facility,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9118-2
01:56:23.777 --> 01:56:27.984
sub category just gives you that
additional routing or that additional

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9118-3
01:56:27.984 --> 01:56:31.895
reporting visibility location.
So depending on what structure and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9118-4
01:56:31.895 --> 01:56:33.909
ServiceNow were proposing to have.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9137-0
01:56:34.829 --> 01:56:36.802
An auto fill,
so as you're typing it comes up or

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9137-1
01:56:36.802 --> 01:56:39.219
potentially a drop down.
We still need to decide on what it

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9137-2
01:56:39.219 --> 01:56:40.709
actually is, but it stops users from.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9160-0
01:56:41.419 --> 01:56:45.869
I think different formats of locations
and again for reporting consistency and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9160-1
01:56:45.869 --> 01:56:48.685
routing,
it provides a bit more kind of structure

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9160-2
01:56:48.685 --> 01:56:49.699
issue description.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9179-0
01:56:51.269 --> 01:56:54.963
I've realised has a drop down that's
incorrect. The idea was an open text box.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9179-1
01:56:54.963 --> 01:56:57.909
So when you're going into it you have
that additional context.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9228-0
01:56:59.629 --> 01:57:04.094
Safety risk area usable and impacting
those are just yes or no's and that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9228-1
01:57:04.094 --> 01:57:08.136
drives your priority rating.
We will need to actually define where

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9228-2
01:57:08.136 --> 01:57:11.334
they route,
but ultimately it's a safety risk as AP1

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9228-3
01:57:11.334 --> 01:57:16.160
if it's not a safety risk, it's AP 2.
But if it's a safety risk and the area is

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9228-4
01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:17.789
unusable, then it's AP one.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9249-0
01:57:18.829 --> 01:57:21.592
Really simple routing,
but gives that granularity and when you

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9249-1
01:57:21.592 --> 01:57:24.750
go into there you have those fields
available in the agent workspace to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9249-2
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:25.189
reference.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9266-0
01:57:28.379 --> 01:57:31.171
The obvious risks or fields that are
missing,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9266-1
01:57:31.171 --> 01:57:33.659
or things that you prefer to restructure.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9278-0
01:57:34.109 --> 01:57:37.943
So this would that be the detail of that
a person would fill in themselves once

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9278-1
01:57:37.943 --> 01:57:38.949
it's online, correct?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9294-0
01:57:42.769 --> 01:57:46.074
I'm just a bit concerned that some of the
questions we're asking someone to fill in,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9294-1
01:57:46.074 --> 01:57:46.929
like the safety risks.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9307-0
01:57:48.039 --> 01:57:51.175
Is the area usable like that?
I think we might get some random weird

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9307-1
01:57:51.175 --> 01:57:52.039
things from people.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9309-0
01:57:51.509 --> 01:57:51.949
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9308-0
01:57:51.923 --> 01:57:53.563
<v Mark Sedge>You'd you'd there'd be a pick list.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9315-0
01:57:55.379 --> 01:57:56.139
OK, so that honest.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9316-0
01:57:55.409 --> 01:57:56.049
It's a yes or no.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9320-0
01:57:57.763 --> 01:57:58.003
<v Mark Sedge>Play song.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9322-0
01:57:58.043 --> 01:58:01.549
<v Mark Sedge>So you'd steer them via the, you know,
the pick list choices. You know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9322-1
01:58:01.549 --> 01:58:05.104
<v Mark Sedge>that would describe what that is and the
tool would highlight, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9322-2
01:58:05.104 --> 01:58:08.707
<v Mark Sedge>we'd be able to put some clarity around
what that content was. So it's a,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9322-3
01:58:08.707 --> 01:58:12.845
<v Mark Sedge>you know, is the user, is the area usable,
IE can people get in there and still work</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9322-4
01:58:12.845 --> 01:58:15.913
<v Mark Sedge>whatever where is unusable, you know,
do you know what I mean?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9322-5
01:58:15.913 --> 01:58:17.763
<v Mark Sedge>That they would be steered gracefully?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9323-0
01:58:18.043 --> 01:58:19.443
<v Mark Sedge>Selecting the right option.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9368-0
01:58:22.049 --> 01:58:24.128
Yeah,
but my concern is that everyone in the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9368-1
01:58:24.128 --> 01:58:26.299
office, if it's just the heating,
it's urgent.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9368-2
01:58:26.299 --> 01:58:29.579
I can't work until this and it's
literally they will see everything as

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9368-3
01:58:29.579 --> 01:58:32.074
panic stations.
I'm worried that everything will just

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9368-4
01:58:32.074 --> 01:58:34.199
come through as emergency when it may not
be,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9368-5
01:58:34.199 --> 01:58:37.849
maybe just something's cold in their
office or they've seen a mouse, you know.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9383-0
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:41.864
The sort of things you'd get in there and
see if it gets really blown up,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9383-1
01:58:41.864 --> 01:58:42.389
so I'm just.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9386-0
01:58:42.843 --> 01:58:46.959
<v Mark Sedge>But you can adjust the priority once it
lands in, you'd liaise with that person.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9386-1
01:58:46.959 --> 01:58:50.110
<v Mark Sedge>You'd calm them down,
so put a jumper on and we're and put it</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9386-2
01:58:50.110 --> 01:58:54.226
<v Mark Sedge>as AP3 or something, right? The point is,
this is just enabling your audience to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9386-3
01:58:54.226 --> 01:58:54.683
<v Mark Sedge>register.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9435-0
01:58:58.209 --> 01:59:02.422
And that would be the the receiving team
that could have that communication about

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9435-1
01:59:02.422 --> 01:59:04.169
changing the priority would it be?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9436-0
01:59:06.249 --> 01:59:10.565
It's whoever has been in assigned to,
or if we have a manager and kind of like

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9436-1
01:59:10.565 --> 01:59:14.226
the sub employees as well,
it's whoever picks up the ticket or the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9436-2
01:59:14.226 --> 01:59:15.209
manager, the kids.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9491-0
01:59:15.989 --> 01:59:17.962
That change the permissioning in the
system,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9491-1
01:59:17.962 --> 01:59:20.856
so I think I think it's again we can
remove it, we can adjust it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9491-2
01:59:20.856 --> 01:59:23.837
We can make it non mandatory,
but the main benefit is it highlights

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9491-3
01:59:23.837 --> 01:59:27.388
what priority is and then you can speak
to them like you said and then manage it

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9491-4
01:59:27.388 --> 01:59:29.668
internally.
But if you don't have that and then the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9491-5
01:59:29.668 --> 01:59:33.263
things are coming through, it's like OK,
this is this isn't the end of the world.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9491-6
01:59:33.263 --> 01:59:36.069
Whereas in reality the area is not usable,
there's electricity.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9500-0
01:59:36.259 --> 01:59:38.979
And why it was coming through and then
you don't have that additional visibility?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9519-0
01:59:39.849 --> 01:59:40.729
I just wonder if.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9520-0
01:59:40.729 --> 01:59:43.690
You're going to too much depth because I
think things like that we would know

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9520-1
01:59:43.690 --> 01:59:45.929
about straight away. There's nothing.
There's floods like.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9521-0
01:59:45.929 --> 01:59:46.169
Literally.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9573-0
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:51.409
When do you want it to be resolved by?
So for instance, if it's a,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9573-1
01:59:51.409 --> 01:59:56.041
the heating isn't working. As an example,
you can be all right if it's not working

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9573-2
01:59:56.041 --> 01:59:57.269
for you know few days.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9574-0
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:58.069
But.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9575-0
01:59:58.149 --> 02:00:00.814
You don't want a meeting office.
That continue doesn't have heating,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9556-0
02:00:00.249 --> 02:00:00.729
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9575-1
02:00:00.814 --> 02:00:03.712
that they'll say like. All right,
can you just sort this out at some point

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9575-2
02:00:03.712 --> 02:00:04.909
this week? Yeah. Normally it's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9576-0
02:00:04.909 --> 02:00:06.789
Not it's not working. It's. I'm cold.
She's hot.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9596-0
02:00:07.749 --> 02:00:10.229
And then she puts it up.
I turn it back down and then sort of

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9596-1
02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:12.629
things you have in the office.
It's more than that working.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9627-0
02:00:11.399 --> 02:00:15.749
Alright, but rather than a pricing no,
because I'm just thinking if if priority

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9627-1
02:00:15.749 --> 02:00:19.119
is too contentious,
do you want a the person to say when they

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9627-2
02:00:19.119 --> 02:00:22.382
want it resolved by?
Because then that gives you an idea of

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9627-3
02:00:22.382 --> 02:00:22.599
how.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9628-0
02:00:22.599 --> 02:00:24.119
Everyone was there as soon as possible.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9629-0
02:00:23.723 --> 02:00:26.563
<v Mark Sedge>But the the the problem is guys,
you just get everyone.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9635-0
02:00:25.859 --> 02:00:27.219
No, I don't have the help.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9636-0
02:00:27.539 --> 02:00:27.899
Did you?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9637-0
02:00:27.829 --> 02:00:28.029
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9649-0
02:00:27.843 --> 02:00:32.411
<v Mark Sedge>You just get everyone saying as soon as
possible or you know so so that, yeah,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9644-0
02:00:30.719 --> 02:00:32.839
Yeah, that's what.
That's what I'm saying in the room.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9649-1
02:00:32.411 --> 02:00:37.210
<v Mark Sedge>the the point of sort of getting them to
by having selectables it it sort of helps</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9649-2
02:00:37.210 --> 02:00:42.066
<v Mark Sedge>them think about just steer them a little
bit in terms of what are the implications</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9649-3
02:00:42.066 --> 02:00:45.073
<v Mark Sedge>etcetera.
Now you're it's never going to be perfect</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9649-4
02:00:45.073 --> 02:00:47.443
<v Mark Sedge>for the audience but the key point is it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9656-0
02:00:47.603 --> 02:00:52.963
<v Mark Sedge>Gives you as the first receivers of the
ticket a little bit more insight to be</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9656-1
02:00:52.963 --> 02:00:58.118
<v Mark Sedge>able to then engage to support the
customer and also you say you might know</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9656-2
02:00:58.118 --> 02:01:03.817
<v Mark Sedge>already if it's a location that's quite a
sort of extreme location that you may not</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9656-3
02:01:03.817 --> 02:01:04.563
<v Mark Sedge>know about.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9658-0
02:01:05.723 --> 02:01:10.061
<v Mark Sedge>It is pertinent to have those questions
to sort of steer them because you might</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9658-1
02:01:10.061 --> 02:01:13.043
<v Mark Sedge>not have eyes and ears on the ground in
all locations.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9683-0
02:01:14.739 --> 02:01:16.019
The base isn't it though for us?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9684-0
02:01:16.019 --> 02:01:16.699
We only look after.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9685-0
02:01:16.699 --> 02:01:17.299
London.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9686-0
02:01:17.859 --> 02:01:20.484
So is always someone in the office of
walking around the street.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9686-1
02:01:20.484 --> 02:01:22.059
Guys will do their walk around so they.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9692-0
02:01:21.563 --> 02:01:25.705
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, but, but what? OK, understood.
But what happens if, say,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9692-1
02:01:25.705 --> 02:01:30.963
<v Mark Sedge>I was in Dubai office and it lost power?
How would I engage someone to help me?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9702-0
02:01:30.009 --> 02:01:31.809
It wouldn't come to us.
It would come to us.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9702-1
02:01:31.809 --> 02:01:34.049
That would be them talking to their
landlords directly.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9708-0
02:01:35.003 --> 02:01:37.481
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So.
So depending on the so the only type.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9708-1
02:01:37.481 --> 02:01:40.836
<v Mark Sedge>So what we could do is if the location
comes up and it's London,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9708-2
02:01:40.836 --> 02:01:44.448
<v Mark Sedge>you could hide a certain number of
questions. You might not ask them,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9708-3
02:01:44.448 --> 02:01:47.339
<v Mark Sedge>you might just put give them if you have
select London,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9708-4
02:01:47.339 --> 02:01:51.468
<v Mark Sedge>you might just ask for a general text box.
What's the problem and you won't ask</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9708-5
02:01:51.468 --> 02:01:54.203
<v Mark Sedge>anything about the priority,
whereas if it's saying.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9716-0
02:01:55.323 --> 02:01:59.324
<v Mark Sedge>To further remoter locations,
you might ask these questions.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9716-1
02:01:59.324 --> 02:02:03.522
<v Mark Sedge>We've got the ability,
depending on what they select to present</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9716-2
02:02:03.522 --> 02:02:06.540
<v Mark Sedge>certain fields or not present certain
fields,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9716-3
02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:09.163
<v Mark Sedge>depending on how you want to operate it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9762-0
02:02:09.799 --> 02:02:11.676
Yeah.
I just think for London because obviously

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9762-1
02:02:11.676 --> 02:02:14.375
we're completely set out, you know,
to like to buy things like that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9762-2
02:02:14.375 --> 02:02:16.213
The less clicks someone has to do,
the better.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9762-3
02:02:16.213 --> 02:02:17.973
I think the more clicks they're going to
do,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9738-0
02:02:16.843 --> 02:02:17.283
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9762-4
02:02:17.973 --> 02:02:20.359
the more likely they're going to pick up
the phone and call.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9763-0
02:02:20.359 --> 02:02:23.753
Ask connect people honestly,
I've ever been thinking about,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9757-0
02:02:21.079 --> 02:02:21.519
You know.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9763-1
02:02:23.753 --> 02:02:25.959
so they've selected lighting and power.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9794-0
02:02:26.749 --> 02:02:30.580
Or whatever.
They've selected the subcategory instead

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9794-1
02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:36.469
of letting names select critical facing
service, you tell them OK, we will aim to.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9790-0
02:02:36.689 --> 02:02:37.409
To have this.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9795-0
02:02:37.829 --> 02:02:39.909
One to four hours or whatever.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9824-0
02:02:40.609 --> 02:02:45.550
Your service levels are actually,
so you're telling them it will be sorted

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9811-0
02:02:41.689 --> 02:02:42.049
That's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9812-0
02:02:44.009 --> 02:02:44.769
A good idea?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9813-0
02:02:45.203 --> 02:02:46.323
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9824-1
02:02:45.550 --> 02:02:49.569
within that time,
so it's not impacting your service levels.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9829-0
02:02:48.803 --> 02:02:52.125
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, you're set.
You you just set the expectation bond</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9828-0
02:02:51.579 --> 02:02:52.059
Yes.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9829-1
02:02:52.125 --> 02:02:55.683
<v Mark Sedge>based upon your capability and they just,
yeah, good shout.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9832-0
02:02:57.523 --> 02:03:02.740
<v Mark Sedge>Do we have all of the local?
Do we have a list of all of our locations</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9832-1
02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:04.283
<v Mark Sedge>and who manages that?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9842-0
02:03:06.679 --> 02:03:10.332
Each location with other own office OPS
manager and they will deal with that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9842-1
02:03:10.332 --> 02:03:10.759
building.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9845-0
02:03:11.883 --> 02:03:15.228
<v Mark Sedge>So.
So there's no central area where we we</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9845-1
02:03:15.228 --> 02:03:18.883
<v Mark Sedge>would maintain a list of all of our
locations.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9902-0
02:03:18.019 --> 02:03:22.309
So yeah, so Michael blitz,
his team probably have the closest list

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9902-1
02:03:22.309 --> 02:03:26.663
for that because they do all that.
So they do all the office moves.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9867-0
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:24.749
Yeah. One second, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9902-2
02:03:26.663 --> 02:03:29.800
For example,
if we are moving from building A to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9902-3
02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:34.090
building B or planning to look for new
premises and whatever else,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9902-4
02:03:34.090 --> 02:03:37.099
that organisation facilitates all of that.
So.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9924-0
02:03:37.909 --> 02:03:41.875
That would be the best data source for
that list I think probably becomes how.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9901-0
02:03:38.243 --> 02:03:38.523
<v Mark Sedge>Sick.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9911-0
02:03:40.443 --> 02:03:41.923
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, so if we.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9924-1
02:03:41.875 --> 02:03:45.189
How is it being tained and up to date
continuously going forward?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9930-0
02:03:46.363 --> 02:03:50.258
<v Mark Sedge>Well, this comes back to.
This comes back to the organisational</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9926-0
02:03:47.109 --> 02:03:47.509
See.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9930-1
02:03:50.258 --> 02:03:54.457
<v Mark Sedge>piece that sort of says because that's so
important for the IT team.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9930-2
02:03:54.457 --> 02:03:57.926
<v Mark Sedge>So important for ask.
So important for facilities in the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9930-3
02:03:57.926 --> 02:04:02.003
<v Mark Sedge>broader sense that you,
Michael and his team would be expected to.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9939-0
02:04:02.563 --> 02:04:05.310
<v Mark Sedge>To manage those as as, say,
CIS in the CMDB,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9939-1
02:04:05.310 --> 02:04:09.033
<v Mark Sedge>so at least as a you'd you'd be picking
from a current list,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9939-2
02:04:09.033 --> 02:04:12.146
<v Mark Sedge>and they'd be audited against and managed
against,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9939-3
02:04:12.146 --> 02:04:14.954
<v Mark Sedge>maintaining the accuracy of that data,
right?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9939-4
02:04:14.954 --> 02:04:17.883
<v Mark Sedge>Because that's where you want to get to,
right?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9937-0
02:04:15.969 --> 02:04:16.489
Absolutely.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9942-0
02:04:16.759 --> 02:04:16.919
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9973-0
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:21.765
That that's where we want to get to.
And I think that really is the messaging.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9973-1
02:04:21.765 --> 02:04:24.450
It's like that's where we want to be.
And so I think again,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9973-2
02:04:24.450 --> 02:04:28.165
we capture it and surface it to say there
needs to be a conversation had with that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9973-3
02:04:28.165 --> 02:04:28.389
team.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9971-0
02:04:29.403 --> 02:04:29.723
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9977-0
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:32.389
But we just need to be realistic.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9986-0
02:04:31.963 --> 02:04:35.259
<v Mark Sedge>I'll catch.
I'll catch that from an IT because that's</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9982-0
02:04:34.269 --> 02:04:35.149
How that would be?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9986-1
02:04:35.259 --> 02:04:38.555
<v Mark Sedge>priority for IT.
So I'll catch that action. And Alex,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9986-2
02:04:38.555 --> 02:04:43.438
<v Mark Sedge>you and I can work out how we engage with
Michael to have that conversation and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/9986-3
02:04:43.438 --> 02:04:46.123
<v Mark Sedge>test that out, perhaps with Matt,
etcetera.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10009-0
02:04:47.119 --> 02:04:50.847
Yeah. I mean,
there's probably other ways without going

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10009-1
02:04:50.847 --> 02:04:55.639
straight to Michael to meet to,
to have those parking. It's one for us.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10008-0
02:04:51.923 --> 02:04:55.823
<v Mark Sedge>OK, well, whatever the whatever the route,
the point is whatever the route is,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10008-1
02:04:55.823 --> 02:04:56.563
<v Mark Sedge>we're catching.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10017-0
02:04:57.659 --> 02:04:59.099
Another one for the action list for.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10031-0
02:05:02.249 --> 02:05:05.729
So we're just kind of talking about the
prioritisation automation there.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10047-0
02:05:07.349 --> 02:05:11.349
Maybe if we can we try and close it out,
but yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10040-0
02:05:09.139 --> 02:05:10.019
So we said we want to.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10085-0
02:05:11.539 --> 02:05:14.464
I just want to with Leanne with your
suggestion then your.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10085-1
02:05:14.464 --> 02:05:18.182
Are you saying that once the kyrians
subcategory are selected and location

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10085-2
02:05:18.182 --> 02:05:19.619
that we would inform them of?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10086-0
02:05:19.619 --> 02:05:19.659
A.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10087-0
02:05:20.219 --> 02:05:24.239
Predicted SLA.
But then you would still get that it

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10087-1
02:05:24.239 --> 02:05:25.939
lands all in the same.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10111-0
02:05:26.749 --> 02:05:30.125
In the same priority in a queue.
So how are you going to, you know,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10111-1
02:05:30.125 --> 02:05:33.749
know that that one's high and this one's
low at a pick up the right one?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10158-0
02:05:34.089 --> 02:05:38.681
The obviously the engineers would know
what priority. Yeah. So they could,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10127-0
02:05:36.719 --> 02:05:37.439
If they go do them.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10158-1
02:05:38.681 --> 02:05:41.558
if it's a lower priority at a higher
priority,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10158-2
02:05:41.558 --> 02:05:46.395
if they can manually change it then.
But it's given the the user expectations,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10158-3
02:05:46.395 --> 02:05:49.089
it's not putting pressure on Ashley's
team.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10159-0
02:05:49.089 --> 02:05:50.449
I think he puts in like he's picked.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10160-0
02:05:50.449 --> 02:05:51.809
Lake or flood?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10202-0
02:05:52.589 --> 02:05:54.509
Like you say, yeah,
it could be like a small 1,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10202-1
02:05:54.509 --> 02:05:57.669
nothing big then that again. Then be more.
That would be P1. That's, you know,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10202-2
02:05:57.669 --> 02:06:00.789
somebody's get there quite quickly and
see what's going on before it does any

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10202-3
02:06:00.789 --> 02:06:02.989
damage. Well, obviously,
if it's just lightning power,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10202-4
02:06:02.989 --> 02:06:05.309
normally it's just bulbs flicking or
something, isn't it?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10208-0
02:06:05.819 --> 02:06:08.339
Anything major sort of thing, so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10213-0
02:06:10.919 --> 02:06:11.359
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10214-0
02:06:11.499 --> 02:06:12.219
Oh, I see.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10218-0
02:06:12.923 --> 02:06:16.351
<v Mark Sedge>To which if say,
it was power and impacted IT,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10218-1
02:06:16.351 --> 02:06:21.675
<v Mark Sedge>tech which has which has primacy?
Is it the IT service levels to recover</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10218-2
02:06:21.675 --> 02:06:26.634
<v Mark Sedge>the power to get that device or whatever
it is back up and running?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10218-3
02:06:26.634 --> 02:06:28.603
<v Mark Sedge>Or do is it the facilities?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10219-0
02:06:29.483 --> 02:06:30.723
<v Mark Sedge>You know a service.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10265-0
02:06:30.199 --> 02:06:33.777
It depends what what the power outage is.
If it's because we've got a generator in

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10265-1
02:06:33.777 --> 02:06:36.235
the building,
so if the power did go down straight away,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10265-2
02:06:36.235 --> 02:06:39.296
the generator would automatically come up.
So we'll be like, you know,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10265-3
02:06:39.296 --> 02:06:42.012
a blip and then straight away generate
will be on and working.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10254-0
02:06:41.163 --> 02:06:41.443
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10265-4
02:06:42.012 --> 02:06:45.159
So it depends what it actually is.
You know, if it's something you know.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10268-0
02:06:45.483 --> 02:06:46.163
<v Mark Sedge>So let's let's.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10283-0
02:06:45.949 --> 02:06:49.098
The book has gone off outside the
building. It'll be different.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10280-0
02:06:48.363 --> 02:06:49.763
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. What I was thinking.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10283-1
02:06:49.098 --> 02:06:50.869
So if you just power cut the corner.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10287-0
02:06:51.563 --> 02:06:54.048
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
and understood what I what went through</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10287-1
02:06:54.048 --> 02:06:56.533
<v Mark Sedge>my mind.
You say you got VIP in an office and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10287-2
02:06:56.533 --> 02:07:00.801
<v Mark Sedge>their local printer plug is blown or
something and they are. They speak to IT,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10287-3
02:07:00.801 --> 02:07:05.176
<v Mark Sedge>it comes through to IT but then they need
facilities to check out the circuit or</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10287-4
02:07:05.176 --> 02:07:07.283
<v Mark Sedge>whatever. How does that? How does that?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10289-0
02:07:07.563 --> 02:07:09.043
<v Mark Sedge>Operation work.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10305-0
02:07:08.169 --> 02:07:11.220
I wouldn't know.
We're literally London centric,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10305-1
02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:14.209
me and Ashley.
So we don't deal with any other.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10307-0
02:07:13.083 --> 02:07:17.430
<v Mark Sedge>So you haven't got any VIPs and execs,
and you haven't got that situation in</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10307-1
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:18.163
<v Mark Sedge>London today?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10344-0
02:07:17.709 --> 02:07:19.989
No. So.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10345-0
02:07:19.989 --> 02:07:21.985
I wouldn't know what other offices would
do.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10345-1
02:07:21.985 --> 02:07:25.576
I see how ours is completely different to
what they might should we do in Milan?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10345-2
02:07:25.576 --> 02:07:29.035
They've got completely different set up
to what we have here was obviously so

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10345-3
02:07:29.035 --> 02:07:31.829
large compared to the lands got,
you know 50 people in it, so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10342-0
02:07:30.683 --> 02:07:31.363
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10353-0
02:07:32.869 --> 02:07:34.989
It probably might be driven by how many
people it affects.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10360-0
02:07:36.369 --> 02:07:37.249
I was, I was thinking.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10363-0
02:07:37.069 --> 02:07:38.829
What what I mean,
if it's just one individual then.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10377-0
02:07:40.039 --> 02:07:42.159
Depends what it is I guess, but.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10373-0
02:07:42.083 --> 02:07:44.203
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So in in IT so, so.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10374-0
02:07:42.169 --> 02:07:42.489
If it's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10378-0
02:07:42.479 --> 02:07:44.479
A whole or then it would drive.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10382-0
02:07:45.443 --> 02:07:48.246
<v Mark Sedge>Sorry Ashley.
To to to so in in the IT world,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10382-1
02:07:48.246 --> 02:07:52.572
<v Mark Sedge>they have a matrix that sort of builds
out whether it's avip impacted,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10382-2
02:07:52.572 --> 02:07:57.325
<v Mark Sedge>whether it's 10 people, 20 people,
a whole floor whole building for IT stuff.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10382-3
02:07:57.325 --> 02:08:02.443
<v Mark Sedge>It just seems there'll be certainly from
my experience of certain power challenges.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10389-0
02:08:03.563 --> 02:08:07.116
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
usually it's sort of aligns organisations</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10389-1
02:08:07.116 --> 02:08:09.917
<v Mark Sedge>align to,
you know the the common set of</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10389-2
02:08:09.917 --> 02:08:14.767
<v Mark Sedge>prioritisation based upon the IT
requirements or the impacted services</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10389-3
02:08:14.767 --> 02:08:18.114
<v Mark Sedge>etcetera.
So maybe that's maybe that's something</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10389-4
02:08:18.114 --> 02:08:21.803
<v Mark Sedge>not for now we just run with what you've
got for now.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10395-0
02:08:22.283 --> 02:08:25.875
<v Mark Sedge>So that's again something that if we're
thinking enterprise,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10395-1
02:08:25.875 --> 02:08:30.055
<v Mark Sedge>we should be sort of considering well,
how do we join these things up.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10395-2
02:08:30.055 --> 02:08:32.999
<v Mark Sedge>So there's a level of fluidity between,
you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10395-3
02:08:32.999 --> 02:08:35.766
<v Mark Sedge>the recoveries for the customer service
angle,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10395-4
02:08:35.766 --> 02:08:38.003
<v Mark Sedge>communications and all the rest of it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10412-0
02:08:39.119 --> 02:08:43.053
Isn't there a rule or an ethos about
whatever office you go to?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10412-1
02:08:43.053 --> 02:08:44.159
It feels the same.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10442-0
02:08:46.459 --> 02:08:48.825
I think that's in colour and design for
that,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10442-1
02:08:48.825 --> 02:08:51.653
but that's that's about where it ends.
Yeah. Yeah. So,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10423-0
02:08:48.959 --> 02:08:49.559
I bet no.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10431-0
02:08:50.679 --> 02:08:51.719
OK, fine, fine.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10442-2
02:08:51.653 --> 02:08:54.739
because we're all completely different
sizes. So it's just.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10445-0
02:08:54.459 --> 02:08:55.499
No, no, completely.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10453-0
02:08:57.189 --> 02:08:59.509
Are we developing a solution here then
just purely for London?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10460-0
02:09:00.359 --> 02:09:00.999
It sounds like.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10461-0
02:09:00.999 --> 02:09:02.599
It just for this.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10459-0
02:09:01.149 --> 02:09:01.389
Just.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10484-0
02:09:03.989 --> 02:09:06.157
Yeah,
because I don't do any of offices use as

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10484-1
02:09:06.157 --> 02:09:08.556
connection.
I think they've got that sort of factor

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10484-2
02:09:08.556 --> 02:09:10.309
in any other office apart from London.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10493-0
02:09:10.439 --> 02:09:12.719
What happens when it gets too hot in
Glasgow or too cold?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10494-0
02:09:12.719 --> 02:09:14.519
In the office cooperations.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10544-0
02:09:15.899 --> 02:09:19.799
And depending on the problem,
it's probably the landlord in Glasgow.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10544-1
02:09:19.799 --> 02:09:23.473
It would be operations.
If it doesn't bond as connect whatsoever

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10544-2
02:09:23.473 --> 02:09:23.699
and.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10545-0
02:09:23.699 --> 02:09:27.254
That would be in those cases most offices
apart from the big ones that Sydney have.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10535-0
02:09:25.699 --> 02:09:28.139
And that's my message and all that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10545-1
02:09:27.254 --> 02:09:29.667
You got that? Yeah,
most of them would just be literally

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10545-2
02:09:29.667 --> 02:09:30.979
landlords, all service offices.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10555-0
02:09:31.789 --> 02:09:33.949
Unlike here,
where we basically it's our building.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10560-0
02:09:34.599 --> 02:09:36.719
So location in this case is always gonna
be London.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10600-0
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.789
But didn't.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10569-0
02:09:38.789 --> 02:09:39.349
Is it just?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10568-0
02:09:40.523 --> 02:09:40.883
<v Mark Sedge>No, you.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10601-0
02:09:40.669 --> 02:09:43.789
The location extrapolate into four and
what not.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10574-0
02:09:41.309 --> 02:09:41.429
The.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10602-0
02:09:43.789 --> 02:09:46.782
But then, didn't we want to do that?
Sorry, but before lunch,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10602-1
02:09:46.782 --> 02:09:50.691
we were saying we wanted to be globalised
because then we can put things like as

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10594-0
02:09:49.563 --> 02:09:49.963
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10602-2
02:09:50.691 --> 02:09:51.029
assets.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10608-0
02:09:51.869 --> 02:09:53.749
So your compliance and things like that
and I'm guessing.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10620-0
02:09:54.439 --> 02:09:56.941
Your other offices,
whether in the Middle East and things

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10620-1
02:09:56.941 --> 02:09:59.183
like that,
they'd have those sorts of requirements,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10620-2
02:09:59.183 --> 02:09:59.399
yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10643-0
02:10:00.359 --> 02:10:02.925
Yeah,
we put that on the parking lot for later.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10643-1
02:10:02.925 --> 02:10:05.919
I think I've got that. No,
we're going to look at that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10650-0
02:10:04.329 --> 02:10:06.694
But I think what I'm going to sorry go on
Mark,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10637-0
02:10:05.443 --> 02:10:05.883
<v Mark Sedge>Predict it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10650-1
02:10:06.694 --> 02:10:09.009
I think you might say what I was going to
say.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10657-0
02:10:09.403 --> 02:10:12.157
<v Mark Sedge>Well, well,
if you as soon as you expose it on the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10657-1
02:10:12.157 --> 02:10:14.856
<v Mark Sedge>portal and you and you want to encourage
its use,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10653-0
02:10:12.869 --> 02:10:13.669
Yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10657-2
02:10:14.856 --> 02:10:19.175
<v Mark Sedge>you're going to get people raising those
tickets and expect to be able to raise</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10657-3
02:10:19.175 --> 02:10:22.684
<v Mark Sedge>the ticket and expect someone to be able
to resolve it for them.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10657-4
02:10:22.684 --> 02:10:27.003
<v Mark Sedge>Doesn't matter what geography they are.
So we need to build this. So it's also.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10664-0
02:10:27.043 --> 02:10:31.181
<v Mark Sedge>So scalable. You know,
you've got to as you grow offices as you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10664-1
02:10:31.181 --> 02:10:36.548
<v Mark Sedge>bring further you know if if you you know
you can't there's a there's a great risk</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10664-2
02:10:36.548 --> 02:10:41.914
<v Mark Sedge>here that you you focus it right the way
down just on in terms of London operation</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10664-3
02:10:41.914 --> 02:10:46.763
<v Mark Sedge>because your operation today is sort of
terrible driven and what have you.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10670-0
02:10:46.843 --> 02:10:47.043
<v Mark Sedge>What?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10672-0
02:10:47.323 --> 02:10:49.836
<v Mark Sedge>What we should be looking at is saying,
well,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10672-1
02:10:49.836 --> 02:10:52.293
<v Mark Sedge>if we're opening up to all of the
customers,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10672-2
02:10:52.293 --> 02:10:55.406
<v Mark Sedge>why wouldn't we have a common mechanism,
doesn't matter.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10672-3
02:10:55.406 --> 02:10:59.448
<v Mark Sedge>The fact that it might go to a landlord
or someone needs to receive that,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10672-4
02:10:59.448 --> 02:11:03.271
<v Mark Sedge>triage it and solve that for that
customer if we want them to use the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10672-5
02:11:03.271 --> 02:11:05.893
<v Mark Sedge>portal.
What you don't want to do is half raise</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10672-6
02:11:05.893 --> 02:11:07.203
<v Mark Sedge>it so that they go well.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10678-0
02:11:07.323 --> 02:11:10.928
<v Mark Sedge>Don't know whether I can raise it on that
route or not that route and then they</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10678-1
02:11:10.928 --> 02:11:13.857
<v Mark Sedge>don't want to use it and then they go
well, why did you do that?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10678-2
02:11:13.857 --> 02:11:17.011
<v Mark Sedge>I sure see it was rubbish. Yeah,
we've got to be thinking enterprise.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10678-3
02:11:17.011 --> 02:11:20.661
<v Mark Sedge>And we've got to think global positioning
and we've got to think about how do we</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10678-4
02:11:20.661 --> 02:11:22.643
<v Mark Sedge>add that if we want to be customer
centric.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10687-0
02:11:23.243 --> 02:11:26.856
<v Mark Sedge>And we want to give them good service and
position it etcetera.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10687-1
02:11:26.856 --> 02:11:29.566
<v Mark Sedge>We should be building this for the whole,
yeah,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10687-2
02:11:29.566 --> 02:11:34.082
<v Mark Sedge>and only when they select London would
you ask different questions or would you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10682-0
02:11:29.829 --> 02:11:30.309
Yeah, I think.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10687-3
02:11:34.082 --> 02:11:36.283
<v Mark Sedge>reduce questions or set an expectation?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10686-0
02:11:34.169 --> 02:11:34.729
Yeah, that's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10688-0
02:11:37.523 --> 02:11:37.723
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Pete.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10692-0
02:11:37.539 --> 02:11:38.139
No, seriously.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10738-0
02:11:37.839 --> 02:11:39.990
So those two ways to that look at that,
mark.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10738-1
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:43.543
One is we need to forget the so which is
required for London and there's an

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10738-2
02:11:43.543 --> 02:11:47.283
element of build and it will come because
some of those conversations are dead,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10738-3
02:11:47.283 --> 02:11:50.649
easy to say as I'm already to operations,
we'll route it to a landlord.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10738-4
02:11:50.649 --> 02:11:52.519
But there's a whole host of other stuff.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10737-0
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:53.469
Needs to happen it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10739-0
02:11:53.559 --> 02:11:54.079
Agreed.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10761-0
02:11:54.489 --> 02:11:59.449
To facilitate that and you know to some
of the other points that you know.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10742-0
02:11:54.563 --> 02:11:56.643
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. Yeah. OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10762-0
02:11:59.449 --> 02:11:59.529
If.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10763-0
02:11:59.529 --> 02:12:02.689
You go to the Middle East and for example
as an office with three people in it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10776-0
02:12:04.279 --> 02:12:07.839
So it needs to be.
It does need a bit more investigation but.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10807-0
02:12:08.889 --> 02:12:12.987
So I think the operating model of the way
that it works facilities as well the fine

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10807-1
02:12:12.987 --> 02:12:15.329
for London,
but not for the other regions it's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10808-0
02:12:15.329 --> 02:12:17.315
Not so.
We don't know how that's going to be at.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10808-1
02:12:17.315 --> 02:12:20.112
So I think you know, Mark,
we don't have an issue kind of restricted

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10808-2
02:12:20.112 --> 02:12:21.409
to London. That's not a problem.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10824-0
02:12:22.419 --> 02:12:24.718
As we can say,
all of the users who are london-based

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10824-1
02:12:24.718 --> 02:12:25.499
would have access.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10825-0
02:12:25.499 --> 02:12:25.739
To this.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10826-0
02:12:25.739 --> 02:12:27.619
Form. So that's that's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10823-0
02:12:26.483 --> 02:12:28.243
<v Mark Sedge>Oh, OK, yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10887-0
02:12:29.439 --> 02:12:32.525
But so you put it right on the global and
having a solution for the rest of the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10887-1
02:12:32.525 --> 02:12:34.416
offices,
it probably means we need to go take it

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10887-2
02:12:34.416 --> 02:12:35.959
away. Having a parking lot. Stairs what?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10855-0
02:12:35.169 --> 02:12:37.489
We need to take away that you've already
got.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10888-0
02:12:35.959 --> 02:12:39.991
Happens to those officers as well.
Post day one. Eventually like I know,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10888-1
02:12:39.991 --> 02:12:44.521
ask an IT are going into ServiceNow but
we are role like there is an idea to roll

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10877-0
02:12:44.329 --> 02:12:44.649
Yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10888-2
02:12:44.521 --> 02:12:46.399
this out. So operations will come.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10906-0
02:12:46.279 --> 02:12:46.959
But, but let's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10907-0
02:12:46.959 --> 02:12:50.319
Not design for the the the fringe cases
and stuff like that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10916-0
02:12:48.999 --> 02:12:50.119
That's not for the ocean, I think.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10917-0
02:12:50.119 --> 02:12:53.519
You might want to start off with this,
as you said for phase one.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10908-0
02:12:50.479 --> 02:12:51.319
Yeah, we've got it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10932-0
02:12:52.309 --> 02:12:56.629
You gotta focus on that before you call.
You have something that quantifies.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10928-0
02:12:54.159 --> 02:12:56.319
K1K1K1K1K1K.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10982-0
02:12:56.759 --> 02:12:59.479
You can start to phase, you know,
new locations coming in where there is a.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10983-0
02:12:59.479 --> 02:13:02.529
Central Facilities management quantify
the improvement in service by using it

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10983-1
02:13:02.529 --> 02:13:04.679
and then sort of see who's going to be
next and who's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10984-0
02:13:04.679 --> 02:13:08.751
Going to be next and whatever. Yeah.
And I think that would probably the roll

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10984-1
02:13:08.751 --> 02:13:11.101
out plan would be quite easy to sort of
say,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/10984-2
02:13:11.101 --> 02:13:14.599
here's your outliers and he's your easy
ones. Yeah, but let's get.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11019-0
02:13:15.599 --> 02:13:20.479
It watertight and good because if it's
not it's you want it to be an easy sale.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11020-0
02:13:20.519 --> 02:13:22.868
So I would probably make it too overly
complicated.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11020-1
02:13:22.868 --> 02:13:26.392
We try to take in all the different
options that all the different parameters

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11020-2
02:13:26.392 --> 02:13:26.799
and then.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11029-0
02:13:27.719 --> 02:13:29.579
Actually,
what we're going to do is solve London

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11029-1
02:13:29.579 --> 02:13:29.959
right now.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11040-0
02:13:30.769 --> 02:13:32.609
With an unmonitored mailbox and the land.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11039-0
02:13:32.719 --> 02:13:33.319
Yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11089-0
02:13:34.809 --> 02:13:39.047
So what we can do with the location?
So if you separate Middle East and all

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11089-1
02:13:39.047 --> 02:13:43.173
the other offices what we thought would
be beneficial is when you go into

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11089-2
02:13:43.173 --> 02:13:46.853
location it gives you requesting just
London at the moment. Yeah,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11089-3
02:13:46.853 --> 02:13:51.369
London office 412345 we can also have
that kind of granularity just in location.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11115-0
02:13:52.409 --> 02:13:55.599
So when you have the ticket open,
you have that for reference.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11115-1
02:13:55.599 --> 02:13:58.637
We can remove it,
but it's just additional information that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11115-2
02:13:58.637 --> 02:14:00.409
can be provided from the submitter.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11141-0
02:14:01.829 --> 02:14:02.229
I don't know.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11142-0
02:14:02.229 --> 02:14:02.589
If that's I.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11122-0
02:14:02.629 --> 02:14:03.149
I don't know.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11143-0
02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:08.787
But putting in like the actual floor maps
because it's like desk 1234 etcetera.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11143-1
02:14:08.787 --> 02:14:11.149
Does that help you or is it floor?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11177-0
02:14:13.339 --> 02:14:14.099
For the financials.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11178-0
02:14:14.099 --> 02:14:16.219
Yeah. You know, for the location.
So it's gonna.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11179-0
02:14:16.219 --> 02:14:20.503
Just gonna be London.
So it's like desk 4321 on the 4th floor.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11179-1
02:14:20.503 --> 02:14:23.699
Does that help?
Does that description help or?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11183-0
02:14:22.909 --> 02:14:25.349
Yeah, location wise for our guys. Yeah,
yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11182-0
02:14:25.569 --> 02:14:25.729
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11229-0
02:14:27.919 --> 02:14:30.671
So we can we can do that.
I don't know if we'd have it in a

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11229-1
02:14:30.671 --> 02:14:33.148
specific location,
but we can have a open field for a

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11229-2
02:14:33.148 --> 02:14:36.772
specific desk or is it just a desk or is
it what level of granularity would be

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11229-3
02:14:36.772 --> 02:14:37.919
beneficial, I suppose it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11246-0
02:14:37.789 --> 02:14:41.858
Yeah,
it could be just toilets like like when,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11230-0
02:14:37.919 --> 02:14:41.039
Depends what the issue is. Yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11246-1
02:14:41.858 --> 02:14:44.629
I don't know which taller it is.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11238-0
02:14:42.519 --> 02:14:43.239
I would. I would.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11289-0
02:14:44.999 --> 02:14:47.909
I would suggest we don't put forward
plans in service now that already in two

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11289-1
02:14:47.909 --> 02:14:50.111
different places.
It means that there's multiple places to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11289-2
02:14:50.111 --> 02:14:52.797
maintain it and whatever else.
So we should just say the floor plans if

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11289-3
02:14:52.797 --> 02:14:53.879
you need them are over there.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11290-0
02:14:53.919 --> 02:14:58.014
Over there. Find them. So so we don't.
Do we not want the floor associated with

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11290-1
02:14:58.014 --> 02:14:58.679
the issue or?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11322-0
02:14:59.359 --> 02:15:01.512
Yeah,
I think it's fine to capture stuff like

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11322-1
02:15:01.512 --> 02:15:04.319
that once we don't need the map of the
floor plan to there.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11306-0
02:15:02.319 --> 02:15:03.199
Granulated itself.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11323-0
02:15:04.319 --> 02:15:06.267
You know,
I think you probably want to give a free

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11323-1
02:15:06.267 --> 02:15:07.719
text, but give some clear description.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11343-0
02:15:07.999 --> 02:15:10.492
Tell us the floor.
Tell us the desk or tell us the room.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11343-1
02:15:10.492 --> 02:15:11.279
There's the issue.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11344-0
02:15:11.279 --> 02:15:13.799
Yeah. Issue affected. Yeah.
I didn't mean like put.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11345-0
02:15:13.799 --> 02:15:15.039
An old form up some.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11385-0
02:15:16.679 --> 02:15:18.519
Like a like a pre populate the desks.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11386-0
02:15:18.759 --> 02:15:18.879
And.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11387-0
02:15:18.879 --> 02:15:22.784
The 4th floor, so 4th floor. Sorry.
Third floor and then you've got all the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11387-1
02:15:22.784 --> 02:15:25.559
desk numbers.
It's it's really hard to break it down.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11373-0
02:15:24.459 --> 02:15:24.859
Select.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11399-0
02:15:26.189 --> 02:15:28.069
You do get to tee point, or it's a taller.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11400-0
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:30.989
Could you put that in?
That's what I'm saying. Could you put in?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11389-0
02:15:28.239 --> 02:15:28.399
But.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11406-0
02:15:29.963 --> 02:15:34.017
<v Mark Sedge>Well, this is this comes back to.
This comes back to the conversation about</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11401-0
02:15:30.529 --> 02:15:31.009
If we could do.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11406-1
02:15:34.017 --> 02:15:37.857
<v Mark Sedge>the assets and the and how you know
because enterprise asset you or the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11406-2
02:15:37.857 --> 02:15:41.270
<v Mark Sedge>tracking about you'd have your floors,
you'd have all of those.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11406-3
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:44.897
<v Mark Sedge>As I've said this morning and walk
through, you'd have keys, types,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11406-4
02:15:44.897 --> 02:15:47.457
<v Mark Sedge>washrooms,
which floor you might even have your</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11406-5
02:15:47.457 --> 02:15:49.323
<v Mark Sedge>sleep stations that you have, yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11414-0
02:15:49.603 --> 02:15:54.167
<v Mark Sedge>All of those would be recorded assets
such that you would be able to then log</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11414-1
02:15:54.167 --> 02:15:58.204
<v Mark Sedge>tickets against those, so you'd have,
you know a lot of these areas.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11414-2
02:15:58.204 --> 02:16:01.714
<v Mark Sedge>You you often will have the facilities
will have, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11414-3
02:16:01.714 --> 02:16:05.985
<v Mark Sedge>like a code or a room location.
So the customer could select those based</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11414-4
02:16:05.985 --> 02:16:09.203
<v Mark Sedge>upon that asset list and as soon as they
start typing.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11421-0
02:16:09.323 --> 02:16:13.171
<v Mark Sedge>It narrows it down and then they select
the one that's pertinent to them.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11421-1
02:16:13.171 --> 02:16:16.238
<v Mark Sedge>So you could do that.
But that's a as we talked about this</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11421-2
02:16:16.238 --> 02:16:18.733
<v Mark Sedge>morning,
that would be something that you would</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11421-3
02:16:18.733 --> 02:16:22.321
<v Mark Sedge>consider doing phase two,
phase three or something later. Initially,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11421-4
02:16:22.321 --> 02:16:26.480
<v Mark Sedge>all you want to do is make it really easy.
I think, Sam, to your point earlier,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11421-5
02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:28.923
<v Mark Sedge>make it really easy for someone just say
look.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11425-0
02:16:29.163 --> 02:16:32.152
<v Mark Sedge>Washroom by the by the lifts or something
like that on floor 2.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11425-1
02:16:32.152 --> 02:16:35.655
<v Mark Sedge>That's that's all you really need.
Cause at the moment they're just giving</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11425-2
02:16:35.655 --> 02:16:37.523
<v Mark Sedge>you an e-mail or something, aren't they?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11434-0
02:16:38.789 --> 02:16:39.109
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11430-0
02:16:39.923 --> 02:16:41.043
<v Mark Sedge>Just might keep it simple.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11437-0
02:16:43.529 --> 02:16:44.089
Simple space.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11447-0
02:16:45.439 --> 02:16:45.839
All right.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11448-0
02:16:46.279 --> 02:16:49.559
So we're saying pretext for both the
location and the description.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11455-0
02:16:51.049 --> 02:16:53.329
Yeah, I think so.
The easiest way to do it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11464-0
02:16:53.619 --> 02:16:56.570
But we're clear restrictions,
clear decisions of what you want from the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11464-1
02:16:56.570 --> 02:16:56.939
the user.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11488-0
02:16:56.969 --> 02:17:01.118
And maybe put like you know, you know,
you see it in italics sometimes,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11495-0
02:17:00.899 --> 02:17:01.659
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11488-1
02:17:01.118 --> 02:17:03.769
like an example of a description that
people.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11496-0
02:17:02.179 --> 02:17:04.979
Describe in clear detail your location,
etcetera.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11530-0
02:17:05.409 --> 02:17:09.243
The risk you're going to get is someone's
going to write London office one.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11530-1
02:17:09.243 --> 02:17:11.009
Someone else is going to say LWS 3.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11517-0
02:17:11.149 --> 02:17:12.509
For the specific building.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11531-0
02:17:11.449 --> 02:17:12.369
If these guys would.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11533-0
02:17:12.369 --> 02:17:14.747
Know though,
like at least if they've given something

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11533-1
02:17:14.747 --> 02:17:17.565
specific that is London,
like we know this form is specifically

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11533-2
02:17:17.565 --> 02:17:18.049
for London.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11556-0
02:17:18.479 --> 02:17:23.099
I'm sure for abbreviations for used,
it's not scalable and for other offices

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11556-1
02:17:23.099 --> 02:17:25.559
obviously. But for I'm assuming you guys.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11562-0
02:17:25.043 --> 02:17:28.082
<v Mark Sedge>But but again,
what you could choose to do again,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11562-1
02:17:28.082 --> 02:17:31.181
<v Mark Sedge>there's in your closure,
so it's a bit like again,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11562-2
02:17:31.181 --> 02:17:36.226
<v Mark Sedge>how we sort of drive some of the instant
sort of resolution and stuff like that in</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11562-3
02:17:36.226 --> 02:17:39.629
<v Mark Sedge>your closure.
You could have a controlled list that the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11562-4
02:17:39.629 --> 02:17:43.215
<v Mark Sedge>your team would recognise.
I say this is location X, yeah,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11562-5
02:17:43.215 --> 02:17:43.883
<v Mark Sedge>controlled.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11568-0
02:17:44.123 --> 02:17:44.403
<v Mark Sedge>That you.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11570-0
02:17:44.443 --> 02:17:48.362
<v Mark Sedge>Wouldn't expose the customer,
but when they close it from the loose</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11570-1
02:17:48.362 --> 02:17:52.050
<v Mark Sedge>description they say yeah this instant it
was resolved by this.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11570-2
02:17:52.050 --> 02:17:56.602
<v Mark Sedge>It was confirmed as this location and
then you report against that information</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11570-3
02:17:56.602 --> 02:18:01.212
<v Mark Sedge>rather than the sort of vagueness of what
the customer says because you want to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11570-4
02:18:01.212 --> 02:18:04.323
<v Mark Sedge>keep the customer a bit simple,
but you want to keep.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11575-0
02:18:04.443 --> 02:18:10.060
<v Mark Sedge>It goes that the guys that know the
ability to resolve with the clarity of</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11575-1
02:18:10.060 --> 02:18:15.003
<v Mark Sedge>that of that item, does that make sense?
That could be an option.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11583-0
02:18:20.209 --> 02:18:21.649
And I think the simpler the better.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11584-0
02:18:21.649 --> 02:18:22.129
I think.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11585-0
02:18:21.659 --> 02:18:21.979
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11582-0
02:18:22.243 --> 02:18:22.523
<v Mark Sedge>Yep.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11590-0
02:18:23.379 --> 02:18:23.699
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11632-0
02:18:23.549 --> 02:18:27.869
We can also try let like why don't we try
it and then if it annoys you guys that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11632-1
02:18:27.869 --> 02:18:31.922
people aren't given what you need,
is it something that we put on a backlog

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11632-2
02:18:31.922 --> 02:18:34.589
or for continuous improvement I don't
know where.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11633-0
02:18:34.589 --> 02:18:37.765
I'll definitely start a simple phase one.
Just give us a call.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11634-0
02:18:36.439 --> 02:18:38.522
Yeah,
but if it's an absolute priority at the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11633-1
02:18:37.765 --> 02:18:39.429
Just subscription about location.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11634-1
02:18:38.522 --> 02:18:38.839
moment.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11664-0
02:18:40.489 --> 02:18:43.291
Hopefully it was, you know,
see the location. Yeah, well,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11664-1
02:18:43.291 --> 02:18:46.914
exactly where that is. Hopefully.
And then if you see it's causing issues,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11664-2
02:18:46.914 --> 02:18:49.329
then we can do enhancement subgrades
later on as.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11665-0
02:18:49.329 --> 02:18:49.769
Well, perfect.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11681-0
02:18:49.619 --> 02:18:51.619
Yeah. OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11682-0
02:18:51.779 --> 02:18:52.539
I mean, to be honest, you.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11683-0
02:18:52.539 --> 02:18:56.699
Can inherit it for yourself. Sorry Alex,
but I think if you just.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11708-0
02:18:57.559 --> 02:19:00.243
In the future,
if you get some really kind of like

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11708-1
02:19:00.243 --> 02:19:04.559
simplified list of all the facilities,
assets, rooms, if we can pull that all up.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11706-0
02:19:03.049 --> 02:19:04.289
That was the whole end.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11717-0
02:19:07.329 --> 02:19:09.689
You can integrate the cadence and say I
am sitting here.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11730-0
02:19:12.049 --> 02:19:14.473
By myself, I can't do that.
There is a facility management that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11730-1
02:19:14.473 --> 02:19:15.609
allows you to do that as well.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11785-0
02:19:17.709 --> 02:19:20.705
Cool. Yeah, I'm. I'm clear.
So that all makes sense.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11736-0
02:19:17.799 --> 02:19:18.199
Like.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11785-1
02:19:20.705 --> 02:19:24.492
We'll we'll simplify it.
The only additional thing I'm thinking is

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11746-0
02:19:20.889 --> 02:19:21.009
The.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11785-2
02:19:24.492 --> 02:19:27.826
when it comes to routing and priority for
the subcategory,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11785-3
02:19:27.826 --> 02:19:31.726
are we going to need to have multiple
different subcategories of the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11785-4
02:19:31.726 --> 02:19:35.853
subcategories of power outage?
I'm assuming you'd have light blinking in

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11785-5
02:19:35.853 --> 02:19:38.509
the kitchen.
That's probably low priority and.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11808-0
02:19:39.079 --> 02:19:41.804
Whole floor is out and then you'd have,
I don't know,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11808-1
02:19:41.804 --> 02:19:45.539
a desk light not working like you have
specific scenarios that would have

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11808-2
02:19:45.539 --> 02:19:46.599
different priorities.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11817-0
02:19:46.569 --> 02:19:49.009
Can we get back on some of the jobs we we
normally get?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11820-0
02:19:48.799 --> 02:19:49.759
Yeah, we can do, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11818-0
02:19:50.283 --> 02:19:50.523
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11887-0
02:19:50.569 --> 02:19:53.279
You know, if it was a whole floor out,
they would be informing.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11887-1
02:19:53.279 --> 02:19:56.667
They'd be on the phone screaming at us.
So it's kind of like I think we need to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11887-2
02:19:56.667 --> 02:19:59.335
make sure we're we're aiming it right for
people. So you know,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11849-0
02:19:58.609 --> 02:19:59.049
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11887-3
02:19:59.335 --> 02:20:02.342
it's not going to be a power outage.
It's going to be a bulb flicking.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11887-4
02:20:02.342 --> 02:20:05.518
It's going to be a stain on the carpet.
It's it's then it's little things.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11887-5
02:20:05.518 --> 02:20:08.270
It's not the beginning.
The big things will be picking the phone

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11874-0
02:20:07.083 --> 02:20:07.403
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11887-6
02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:10.049
up and we'll all be talking to each other.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11909-0
02:20:10.929 --> 02:20:13.170
Getting it resolved.
So I think we just need to make sure

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11909-1
02:20:13.170 --> 02:20:14.329
we're aiming it right for the.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11928-0
02:20:14.379 --> 02:20:17.496
Yeah. Well, I mean we,
we we do struggle a little bit with with

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11928-1
02:20:17.496 --> 02:20:21.490
sort of going back on historic data that
is one of the things that we do struggle

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11928-2
02:20:21.490 --> 02:20:22.659
with. But we could look.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11973-0
02:20:23.479 --> 02:20:27.286
A month back, do you see what I mean?
Some of the guys have said, you know,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11934-0
02:20:25.239 --> 02:20:25.759
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11973-1
02:20:27.286 --> 02:20:29.791
if it's a if,
it's a problematic phone call unit.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11973-2
02:20:29.791 --> 02:20:33.147
If you could put the asset in or you
could put the, the, the, the,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11973-3
02:20:33.147 --> 02:20:37.054
the end user's name in or something,
you could see how many times that's been

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11973-4
02:20:37.054 --> 02:20:39.559
a problem.
And do we have to go deeper into that?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12018-0
02:20:40.489 --> 02:20:44.724
That's a bit that's probably missing that
you've put in your parking lot or

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12018-1
02:20:44.724 --> 02:20:47.009
whatever. But yeah, we can get some data.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12019-0
02:20:47.009 --> 02:20:47.489
Can't we?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/11995-0
02:20:47.549 --> 02:20:48.549
The two sides.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12020-0
02:20:49.769 --> 02:20:53.740
One side is when pet staff on a report an
issue and there's staff and there's the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12020-1
02:20:53.740 --> 02:20:57.129
second issues when we want to know what's
going on with the plan and.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12078-0
02:20:57.799 --> 02:21:01.116
You know, as you said,
reporting and find out if it's the same

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12078-1
02:21:01.116 --> 02:21:04.644
problem over and over again.
So it's going to almost like 2 parts.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12042-0
02:21:04.049 --> 02:21:05.129
Yeah. Yeah, just.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12078-2
02:21:04.644 --> 02:21:08.119
It's really more complex for us,
more simple for the front users.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12048-0
02:21:07.089 --> 02:21:07.689
Today, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12079-0
02:21:08.119 --> 02:21:08.399
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12080-0
02:21:09.279 --> 02:21:11.666
And in regards to what you just said
about historic,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12080-1
02:21:11.666 --> 02:21:14.639
if we're keeping out the big items,
you won't have that historic.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12070-0
02:21:14.499 --> 02:21:15.059
For visibility.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12081-0
02:21:15.119 --> 02:21:17.959
So if for every reason every six months
doesn't flood or every.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12122-0
02:21:18.399 --> 02:21:21.074
The significant power outage,
and I'm not saying there is,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12122-1
02:21:21.074 --> 02:21:23.659
but just for example you won't have that
reference data.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12122-2
02:21:23.659 --> 02:21:27.196
You won't have all the communications and
discussions kept in one centralised

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12122-3
02:21:27.196 --> 02:21:30.596
ticket. It will be maintained as is.
Is that something that you want going

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12122-4
02:21:30.596 --> 02:21:30.959
forward?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12157-0
02:21:33.239 --> 02:21:38.113
I think if we if we if we could work,
you know and refer back to a problematic,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12157-1
02:21:38.113 --> 02:21:42.987
A problematic asset that that would help.
I mean you can't obviously categorise

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12157-2
02:21:42.987 --> 02:21:45.119
every single fault that's happened.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12158-0
02:21:45.119 --> 02:21:45.159
I.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12159-0
02:21:45.599 --> 02:21:48.879
Understand that because you wouldn't have
the job number to refer back to.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12165-0
02:21:49.639 --> 02:21:50.919
It's not going to make any sense, is it?
But.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12170-0
02:21:52.129 --> 02:21:53.329
Suppose if we've got.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12189-0
02:21:53.879 --> 02:21:57.065
A way of searching a problematic asset,
putting that information in,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12189-1
02:21:57.065 --> 02:22:00.159
could it draw that information back?
I don't know if that's paper.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12224-0
02:21:59.849 --> 02:22:03.929
But did you have asset tax on all of your
kind of facility like?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12225-0
02:22:04.249 --> 02:22:08.521
It's. Yeah, it's something.
It's something that that we've that I'm

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12225-1
02:22:08.521 --> 02:22:13.358
trying to establish really because I'm
not sure how that geography was built

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12225-2
02:22:13.358 --> 02:22:14.489
into chairwell so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12239-0
02:22:15.449 --> 02:22:19.769
Having spoken to my guys,
we've got some asset lists I don't.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12240-0
02:22:19.969 --> 02:22:21.689
How accurate or upstate they are?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12255-0
02:22:23.239 --> 02:22:25.812
I know that's how that really interacts
with Cherwell,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12255-1
02:22:25.812 --> 02:22:28.479
and how much of that you're going to be
able to extract.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12256-0
02:22:28.479 --> 02:22:28.919
For this.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12263-0
02:22:29.603 --> 02:22:33.375
<v Mark Sedge>So, so, so Ashley just on that one,
this comes back to how they close the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12263-1
02:22:33.375 --> 02:22:35.975
<v Mark Sedge>task. Well,
you could have it so that they close a</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12263-2
02:22:35.975 --> 02:22:39.187
<v Mark Sedge>part of the closure.
There's a field where they if they've got</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12263-3
02:22:39.187 --> 02:22:42.245
<v Mark Sedge>the asset tag because they're standing by
and they can run,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12263-4
02:22:42.245 --> 02:22:46.323
<v Mark Sedge>they can add it to a field and then put
the resolution activity or whatever in.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12271-0
02:22:46.643 --> 02:22:50.651
<v Mark Sedge>And that in that so instead of having,
you wouldn't necessarily get it from the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12271-1
02:22:50.651 --> 02:22:53.155
<v Mark Sedge>customer,
but you'd get it as part of the closure</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12271-2
02:22:53.155 --> 02:22:55.610
<v Mark Sedge>routine.
And then that would be able to give you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12271-3
02:22:55.610 --> 02:22:58.515
<v Mark Sedge>the chance to say,
hang on a minute that asset that asset</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12271-4
02:22:58.515 --> 02:23:01.971
<v Mark Sedge>tag has cropped up 15 times.
So some of this we could build into the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12268-0
02:22:58.559 --> 02:22:58.799
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12271-5
02:23:01.971 --> 02:23:03.123
<v Mark Sedge>closure and resolution.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12276-0
02:23:03.483 --> 02:23:07.556
<v Mark Sedge>Part of the ticket which you have total
control of and you've got the knowledge</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12276-1
02:23:07.556 --> 02:23:09.847
<v Mark Sedge>of,
so that would be you know that's where I</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12276-2
02:23:09.847 --> 02:23:12.749
<v Mark Sedge>was coming back to.
They could select the exact location</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12276-3
02:23:12.749 --> 02:23:16.771
<v Mark Sedge>based upon where they know the like you
know because they know what those like</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12276-4
02:23:16.771 --> 02:23:18.603
<v Mark Sedge>they could do the tag. So if it's a.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12284-0
02:23:19.483 --> 02:23:23.031
<v Mark Sedge>Hot water tap or something.
There's often that there'll be A tag or a</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12284-1
02:23:23.031 --> 02:23:27.135
<v Mark Sedge>plug under the unit, or what you know,
so you could ask them to put that in as a</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12281-0
02:23:24.399 --> 02:23:24.559
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12284-2
02:23:27.135 --> 02:23:30.936
<v Mark Sedge>mandatory field to close the record,
and then you can start to interrogate</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12284-3
02:23:30.936 --> 02:23:35.192
<v Mark Sedge>that to give you some of that visibility
even if you haven't got all the assets in,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12284-4
02:23:35.192 --> 02:23:36.763
<v Mark Sedge>you could do that from day one.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12286-0
02:23:37.569 --> 02:23:37.729
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12335-0
02:23:39.329 --> 02:23:42.442
I do think it's worth having like an
asset filled on on the form,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12335-1
02:23:42.442 --> 02:23:44.329
but you can then just start to populate.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12305-0
02:23:42.709 --> 02:23:43.149
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12336-0
02:23:44.809 --> 02:23:45.129
As you get.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12337-0
02:23:45.129 --> 02:23:47.875
More and more assets in there and you can
start to capture as well.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12337-1
02:23:47.875 --> 02:23:49.409
It just gives a little more reporting.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12324-0
02:23:49.509 --> 02:23:50.309
Thanks as well, I'm just.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12338-0
02:23:50.369 --> 02:23:51.089
There might be a piece.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12339-0
02:23:51.089 --> 02:23:52.849
Of work for my guys today to go out.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12346-0
02:23:54.289 --> 02:23:55.249
You know, find some of this data.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12390-0
02:23:55.849 --> 02:24:00.170
It just takes some time,
just like tag everything to actually find

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12343-0
02:23:56.243 --> 02:23:56.603
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12390-1
02:24:00.170 --> 02:24:02.169
it all story classify it, it's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12371-0
02:24:02.289 --> 02:24:03.289
I think I thought to do that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12391-0
02:24:03.209 --> 02:24:04.489
Yeah, it might just come from.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12392-0
02:24:04.489 --> 02:24:04.569
My.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12393-0
02:24:04.569 --> 02:24:07.554
Renown manuals,
original operational manuals that were

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12393-1
02:24:07.554 --> 02:24:11.569
handed over as part of Fit out.
It's that type of thing really, you know.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12397-0
02:24:11.239 --> 02:24:11.399
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12389-0
02:24:11.363 --> 02:24:12.403
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12417-0
02:24:12.439 --> 02:24:14.239
It's a bit of a grey area I think at the
minute, but you?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12401-0
02:24:14.163 --> 02:24:14.323
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12406-0
02:24:14.419 --> 02:24:14.939
You might.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12418-0
02:24:14.679 --> 02:24:14.879
Have.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12419-0
02:24:14.919 --> 02:24:19.719
Common themes like usually it's a light
bulb like you said that's flickering or.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12459-0
02:24:20.879 --> 02:24:22.759
Top yeah, somebody spills something. I.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12460-0
02:24:23.719 --> 02:24:25.664
Think we should put it as a parking lot
item?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12439-0
02:24:25.569 --> 02:24:26.569
Yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12460-1
02:24:25.664 --> 02:24:28.159
Just have some discussion about that and
Mark we probably.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12461-0
02:24:28.159 --> 02:24:28.319
Need.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12462-0
02:24:28.319 --> 02:24:31.199
To kind of tie it back to kind of the IT
asset management.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12463-0
02:24:31.199 --> 02:24:32.439
Piece as well, because we're going to.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12471-0
02:24:31.443 --> 02:24:31.683
<v Mark Sedge>Play song.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12472-0
02:24:31.723 --> 02:24:36.125
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, 100 and I took that this. Sorry,
Julian, you weren't in conversation.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12466-0
02:24:35.649 --> 02:24:36.009
Sorry.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12472-1
02:24:36.125 --> 02:24:40.701
<v Mark Sedge>I don't recall you being in the meeting
room at earlier, but we've picked out.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12472-2
02:24:40.701 --> 02:24:44.930
<v Mark Sedge>I've picked that action up because what
I'd like to do is do a separate.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12472-3
02:24:44.930 --> 02:24:48.811
<v Mark Sedge>We agreed that it might not necessarily
be in this push, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12472-4
02:24:48.811 --> 02:24:51.243
<v Mark Sedge>for to because it's not in Cherwell today.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12479-0
02:24:51.723 --> 02:24:54.559
<v Mark Sedge>Therefore,
you know there's no risk that there's no</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12479-1
02:24:54.559 --> 02:24:58.321
<v Mark Sedge>greater risk not having it,
but it's something that you know myself,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12479-2
02:24:58.321 --> 02:25:00.720
<v Mark Sedge>Alex,
and the team will have will work with</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12479-3
02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:04.101
<v Mark Sedge>Ashley and we'll start to talk about the
art of the possible,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12479-4
02:25:04.101 --> 02:25:08.190
<v Mark Sedge>because part of what we're actually
through my head, Julian, was thinking,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12479-5
02:25:08.190 --> 02:25:11.243
<v Mark Sedge>well, you know,
a lot of organisations just role asset.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12486-0
02:25:11.443 --> 02:25:15.154
<v Mark Sedge>Into ITSM because there's so much
commonality that you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12486-1
02:25:15.154 --> 02:25:20.020
<v Mark Sedge>so an incident can be prioritised with
the facilities drop down all of that you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12486-2
02:25:20.020 --> 02:25:24.399
<v Mark Sedge>know you can do some segregation,
but that could be a route really fast</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12486-3
02:25:24.399 --> 02:25:29.265
<v Mark Sedge>route to solve some of these things right
off the bat and also ready them for a</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12486-4
02:25:29.265 --> 02:25:30.603
<v Mark Sedge>global route that say.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12491-0
02:25:31.163 --> 02:25:34.509
<v Mark Sedge>You know, somebody on a local site,
you know, like the desk side,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12491-1
02:25:34.509 --> 02:25:38.260
<v Mark Sedge>hands and feet on the ground and the
local site might be able to update a</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12491-2
02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:42.062
<v Mark Sedge>record with the same, you know,
because they're getting tickets elsewhere.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12491-3
02:25:42.062 --> 02:25:42.923
<v Mark Sedge>You get my drift.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12496-0
02:25:44.479 --> 02:25:44.639
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12540-0
02:25:45.659 --> 02:25:48.914
I think this sort of lends itself to what
we were speaking about, like,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12540-1
02:25:48.914 --> 02:25:52.214
for instance, she kitchen equipment.
Is it replacement or repair after a

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12540-2
02:25:52.214 --> 02:25:54.519
certain time?
Are we going to keep frying money at

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12540-3
02:25:54.519 --> 02:25:57.819
repairs when actually it's going to be
better off to replace if you can?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12525-0
02:25:57.523 --> 02:25:57.643
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12541-0
02:25:57.819 --> 02:26:00.139
Get that data you know,
if your caller charge.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12542-0
02:26:00.139 --> 02:26:02.059
Or something an engineer like.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12555-0
02:26:01.399 --> 02:26:05.679
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Let's just pop it out.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12553-0
02:26:03.439 --> 02:26:04.799
Replace it. That would have been.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12559-0
02:26:06.003 --> 02:26:10.461
<v Mark Sedge>So and actually just and that's where
there's commonality with IT.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12559-1
02:26:10.461 --> 02:26:15.651
<v Mark Sedge>So just as you would have a depreciation
depreciating asset that's that's IT.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12559-2
02:26:15.651 --> 02:26:19.843
<v Mark Sedge>You'd have the same thing.
So you know you might have certain.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12567-0
02:26:20.723 --> 02:26:23.304
<v Mark Sedge>Yes.
So dishwashing equipment or microwave or</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12567-1
02:26:23.304 --> 02:26:27.174
<v Mark Sedge>all of those in hot taps that after a
period of time go beyond their</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12567-2
02:26:27.174 --> 02:26:31.100
<v Mark Sedge>serviceable lives or their there might be
their warranty or whatever.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12567-3
02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:35.475
<v Mark Sedge>And then you know that you're ready to
swap those out or if you're getting an</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12565-0
02:26:33.079 --> 02:26:33.239
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12567-4
02:26:35.475 --> 02:26:38.729
<v Mark Sedge>increase of tickets to that,
to your point, you know why?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12567-5
02:26:38.729 --> 02:26:40.243
<v Mark Sedge>Because you know that it's.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12575-0
02:26:40.683 --> 02:26:42.950
<v Mark Sedge>Gone.
You know you've got some correlation.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12569-0
02:26:41.179 --> 02:26:41.979
Yeah, I'm sorry.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12575-1
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:46.865
<v Mark Sedge>And also if you know the cost of it,
you can. If someone said to you, well,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12572-0
02:26:43.599 --> 02:26:43.799
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12575-2
02:26:46.865 --> 02:26:49.750
<v Mark Sedge>what's the cost of the assets that we've
got in London,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12575-3
02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:52.480
<v Mark Sedge>if we had to replace all the all the taps,
you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12575-4
02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:56.755
<v Mark Sedge>hot taps or whatever you could report on
that because you'd have the purchase cost</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12575-5
02:26:56.755 --> 02:26:58.043
<v Mark Sedge>and the replacement cost?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12577-0
02:26:58.643 --> 02:27:01.563
<v Mark Sedge>Because that's all part of what's the
same as IT kit, right?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12579-0
02:27:02.559 --> 02:27:03.279
Yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12586-0
02:27:04.759 --> 02:27:06.999
Tweaks in here around so location.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12631-0
02:27:08.559 --> 02:27:12.790
Just to summarise what I've understood,
so make free text for both the location

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12631-1
02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:16.121
and issue description.
Category and subcategory will drive the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12631-2
02:27:16.121 --> 02:27:18.924
priority.
So what we need from you is that category,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12631-3
02:27:18.924 --> 02:27:23.154
subcategory and then what priorities we
want to be rooted to and then we'll set

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12631-4
02:27:23.154 --> 02:27:24.159
up those workflows.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12653-0
02:27:25.199 --> 02:27:27.886
Add an asset field.
I'm assuming we want that non mandatory.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12653-1
02:27:27.886 --> 02:27:30.000
If you know that asset field you can add
it in.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12653-2
02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.599
If you don't then it just remains as an
empty field in it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12673-0
02:27:32.779 --> 02:27:35.068
Be more on the back end for you guys in
the closure,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12671-0
02:27:33.959 --> 02:27:35.759
Think that would be, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12673-1
02:27:35.068 --> 02:27:37.659
bit that we're going for the end user
because there was no.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12688-0
02:27:41.289 --> 02:27:43.590
So in the Asian workspace,
when you're managing the ticket,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12688-1
02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:45.009
you'll have a passage. Perfect. Cool.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12708-0
02:27:47.069 --> 02:27:50.746
And then we're saying we're going to
remove safety risk area usable and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12708-1
02:27:50.746 --> 02:27:52.789
impacting critical slash facing clients.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12717-0
02:27:53.039 --> 02:27:56.479
Yeah, I think so. Great as simple as that,
yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12724-0
02:27:55.759 --> 02:27:56.559
Possible going?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12725-0
02:27:56.719 --> 02:27:58.439
To have to string my solution, but it's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12746-0
02:28:00.449 --> 02:28:05.257
That makes sense. Simple. First, cool.
We'll we'll make those tweaks and then

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12746-1
02:28:05.257 --> 02:28:09.449
we'll send that out afterwards with the
additional updates mock up.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12768-0
02:28:09.759 --> 02:28:13.121
And we have to keep the attachments.
I think it's good if someone's got their

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12768-1
02:28:13.121 --> 02:28:15.577
phone, got a picture of it,
go look then he's got handy.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12760-0
02:28:14.459 --> 02:28:14.739
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12768-2
02:28:15.577 --> 02:28:16.439
Sometimes you don't.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12769-0
02:28:16.439 --> 02:28:17.319
Know what to call it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12787-0
02:28:19.519 --> 02:28:20.879
You can look on the tube if it's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12789-0
02:28:20.269 --> 02:28:24.149
Yeah, she was saying it to me, you puddle.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12788-0
02:28:20.879 --> 02:28:22.839
An actual flood or just a small?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12792-0
02:28:28.479 --> 02:28:28.799
No.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12804-0
02:28:32.319 --> 02:28:36.959
They don't want to do it at the moment.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12800-0
02:28:32.679 --> 02:28:34.159
She just told me. I don't know what else.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12824-0
02:28:36.809 --> 02:28:41.329
We first got a kit and my son got called
into school.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12825-0
02:28:41.409 --> 02:28:47.049
They put yourself harm in somebody,
scratches down, you know, like that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12884-0
02:28:50.799 --> 02:28:51.839
It works with noise rollout.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12885-0
02:28:51.839 --> 02:28:52.799
All right.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12886-0
02:28:53.399 --> 02:28:58.129
Cool in regards to the auto routing,
we made some assumptions and based on our

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12886-1
02:28:58.129 --> 02:29:02.918
discussions so far, I think it's in line,
but we're assuming the categories and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12886-2
02:29:02.918 --> 02:29:06.929
subcategories relating to M&amp;
E will auto route anything that's

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12886-3
02:29:06.929 --> 02:29:11.479
relating to a non share World Team.
So like cleaning, catering, perception.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12913-0
02:29:11.859 --> 02:29:16.011
We'll then go to ask Connect, ask,
Connect will then triage it and manage it

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12913-1
02:29:16.011 --> 02:29:19.139
within ServiceNow,
but then send out emails and comps and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12913-2
02:29:19.139 --> 02:29:21.619
then close it afterwards once it's
completed.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12917-0
02:29:27.249 --> 02:29:27.929
Essentially.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12928-0
02:29:29.749 --> 02:29:33.509
Eyes are gonna be any visibility for the
other teams.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12957-0
02:29:34.859 --> 02:29:37.378
Payments, etc.
I think that's probably been discussed as

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12936-0
02:29:35.399 --> 02:29:35.759
Yes.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12957-1
02:29:37.378 --> 02:29:40.162
the latter phase thing,
but when that comes in could take that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12968-0
02:29:37.979 --> 02:29:40.971
OK, so the sex is? Yeah, that's fine.
That's fine.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12957-2
02:29:40.162 --> 02:29:40.339
off.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12968-1
02:29:40.971 --> 02:29:44.139
Because that's what would normally would
happen here.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13008-0
02:29:43.279 --> 02:29:45.603
The visibility piece I think suggested
earlier,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13008-1
02:29:45.603 --> 02:29:49.282
but we said it was too much admin.
We could potentially set up some reports

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13008-2
02:29:49.282 --> 02:29:52.914
for things that are outstanding.
So it can be daily report, weekly report,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13008-3
02:29:52.914 --> 02:29:56.738
monthly reports and so we can certainly
and I'll have visibility what's in the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/12995-0
02:29:53.469 --> 02:29:53.909
OK, OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13008-4
02:29:56.738 --> 02:29:59.159
system,
but they won't have access to the system.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13010-0
02:30:00.719 --> 02:30:00.919
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13027-0
02:30:01.459 --> 02:30:07.153
But we'll we still are saving some some
efforts with the the Director in there

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13027-1
02:30:07.153 --> 02:30:08.739
for the M&amp;E stuff.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13090-0
02:30:09.659 --> 02:30:10.219
Yeah. So.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13034-0
02:30:10.289 --> 02:30:10.449
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13091-0
02:30:10.579 --> 02:30:10.819
That's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13092-0
02:30:10.979 --> 02:30:15.566
Exciting I ideally day 2 when they we
have got it on the mobile apps in South

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13092-1
02:30:15.566 --> 02:30:20.507
then we'd like to make sure that they can
add cleaners and catering and everyone to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13092-2
02:30:20.507 --> 02:30:22.859
it. I think once we've got past day one.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13093-0
02:30:22.979 --> 02:30:24.783
Once, once we have them in,
we can auto read them.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13093-1
02:30:24.783 --> 02:30:27.612
We'll set them up as assignment groups.
You have the cleaning assignment group.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13093-2
02:30:27.612 --> 02:30:30.299
You'll have a manager of that group,
and then we'll also route the tickets.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13135-0
02:30:30.519 --> 02:30:32.606
And subcategory.
Same thing that's going to you,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13135-1
02:30:32.606 --> 02:30:35.799
but instead we start sending them out to
where they need to go. So not an.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13136-0
02:30:35.799 --> 02:30:37.959
Issue because it seems that's not
currently.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13137-0
02:30:38.399 --> 02:30:41.078
So we're not doing it in phase one,
but I'm saying if we do bring them on,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13137-1
02:30:41.078 --> 02:30:42.792
we can easily set them up as assignment
groups.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13137-2
02:30:42.792 --> 02:30:44.399
But that's a wider discussion in the
future.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13157-0
02:30:45.199 --> 02:30:48.383
That's a licence implication as well,
because there might be significant

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13157-1
02:30:48.383 --> 02:30:51.611
numbers that we need to add and so we
just need to take that way and just

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13157-2
02:30:51.611 --> 02:30:53.399
understand the cost implications as well.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13162-0
02:31:02.039 --> 02:31:02.639
Exactly.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13170-0
02:31:05.022 --> 02:31:08.636
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So just so I'm right here,
when we're when like a request or</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13170-1
02:31:08.636 --> 02:31:13.020
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>etcetera is filling out this form,
we will identify based on category and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13170-2
02:31:13.020 --> 02:31:17.226
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>sub category. What is M&amp;
E related and that will just go direct to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13170-3
02:31:17.226 --> 02:31:21.670
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>that area and then anything else just
philtres in to ask as it does that's</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13168-0
02:31:18.789 --> 02:31:19.029
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13170-4
02:31:21.670 --> 02:31:23.862
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>present day just now Leanne isn't it?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13180-0
02:31:24.379 --> 02:31:24.499
But.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13172-0
02:31:24.542 --> 02:31:27.062
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Maybe just e-mail you directly anyway to
connect.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13181-0
02:31:28.899 --> 02:31:30.019
We're still a step forward.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13179-0
02:31:30.369 --> 02:31:30.889
Yes.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13183-0
02:31:31.142 --> 02:31:34.382
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah, that's fine.
Just so I'm clearing my head. Thanks guys.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13187-0
02:31:36.239 --> 02:31:37.479
Yep, I think all clear.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13197-0
02:31:39.369 --> 02:31:42.489
Is everyone relatively happy with the
solution? Once we make those changes?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13206-0
02:31:43.799 --> 02:31:44.199
Cool, I think.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13207-0
02:31:45.479 --> 02:31:46.559
We're good to go for next slide.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13235-0
02:31:49.159 --> 02:31:51.548
So this,
we won't spend too much time on this,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13235-1
02:31:51.548 --> 02:31:54.548
but just briefly,
you'll have an agent workspace dedicated

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13235-2
02:31:54.548 --> 02:31:57.039
to your team to be able to manage those
tickets.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13250-0
02:31:58.639 --> 02:32:02.162
And it will be routed to. Like I said,
the corresponding team based on the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13250-1
02:32:02.162 --> 02:32:02.679
categories.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13274-0
02:32:02.789 --> 02:32:05.815
I do have,
I think we have an e-mail integrate

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13274-1
02:32:05.815 --> 02:32:10.320
cleaning team wouldn't be there,
wouldn't be there. No, you're right.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13267-0
02:32:08.969 --> 02:32:10.089
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13274-2
02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:12.509
Sorry. I was thinking phase three.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13286-0
02:32:14.159 --> 02:32:17.479
So the only caveat is with the e-mail
integration.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13312-0
02:32:19.159 --> 02:32:21.723
Instead of manually dealing with that,
it will come through.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13312-1
02:32:21.723 --> 02:32:24.538
It'll come through to us,
connect as a ticket every time it's sent

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13312-2
02:32:24.538 --> 02:32:25.799
through to that group mailbox.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13330-0
02:32:27.559 --> 02:32:31.319
So you'll be also managing the e-mail
integration tickets as they come in

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13330-1
02:32:31.319 --> 02:32:33.199
within ServiceNow instead of Outlook.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13332-0
02:32:34.879 --> 02:32:34.919
So.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13373-0
02:32:35.539 --> 02:32:38.232
Yeah,
it's still a benefit in terms of it's

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13373-1
02:32:38.232 --> 02:32:41.966
being managed internally,
but you have the risk of duplicate

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13373-2
02:32:41.966 --> 02:32:43.619
tickets and people sending.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13374-0
02:32:43.899 --> 02:32:46.600
Is this?
Do you mean like when the user emails

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13374-1
02:32:46.600 --> 02:32:48.899
instead of going on to the photo, right?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13375-0
02:32:48.899 --> 02:32:50.779
So we're still capturing that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13416-0
02:32:51.599 --> 02:32:54.144
And you can also natively respond from
within ServiceNow.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13416-1
02:32:54.144 --> 02:32:57.258
So as long as the correspondence are in
the same e-mail, e-mail chain,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13416-2
02:32:57.258 --> 02:33:00.680
everything's captured on that ticket.
So if you need reference in the future,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13416-3
02:33:00.680 --> 02:33:04.058
you can just go back to that ticket
instead of finding what's been discussed

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13416-4
02:33:04.058 --> 02:33:05.199
on separate e-mail chains.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13424-0
02:33:06.382 --> 02:33:09.813
<v Mark Sedge>And some some of this just because it's a
valid point, right,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13424-1
02:33:09.813 --> 02:33:14.075
<v Mark Sedge>that sometimes a customer rate if the
customer raised it through the portal,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13424-2
02:33:14.075 --> 02:33:17.507
<v Mark Sedge>you know once it's confirmed is submitted
back to them, yeah,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13424-3
02:33:17.507 --> 02:33:22.045
<v Mark Sedge>there needs to be some message into them
to say this is your route to communicate</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13424-4
02:33:22.045 --> 02:33:24.702
<v Mark Sedge>not then send an e-mail because then you
could.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13430-0
02:33:25.142 --> 02:33:30.021
<v Mark Sedge>And I don't mean you can't join it up,
so some of this stuff is about, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13430-1
02:33:30.021 --> 02:33:34.780
<v Mark Sedge>the organisational messaging that enables
customers to say if you've loaded it</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13430-2
02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:38.273
<v Mark Sedge>through the portal,
don't then send an e-mail to say, oh,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13430-3
02:33:38.273 --> 02:33:40.382
<v Mark Sedge>I've sent you, I've seen it happen.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13435-0
02:33:40.742 --> 02:33:42.949
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
I've sent you this via the portal.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13435-1
02:33:42.949 --> 02:33:45.696
<v Mark Sedge>Can you look?
And then you've got 2 records running for</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13435-2
02:33:45.696 --> 02:33:48.542
<v Mark Sedge>the same thing.
It's just about setting that expectation.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13436-0
02:33:51.582 --> 02:33:52.182
<v Mark Sedge>Make sense?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13445-0
02:33:51.622 --> 02:33:53.730
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yes.
So that's probably part of the change</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13445-1
02:33:53.730 --> 02:33:56.427
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>piece, isn't it?
And that way there piece around here,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13438-0
02:33:54.742 --> 02:33:55.182
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13445-2
02:33:56.427 --> 02:33:59.859
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>we're educating people to use the portal
as a replacement for e-mail.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13445-3
02:33:59.859 --> 02:34:03.144
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>And the first instance with as we know,
not everyone will do that,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13440-0
02:34:00.942 --> 02:34:01.782
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, 100%.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13445-4
02:34:03.144 --> 02:34:05.302
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>but that is the messaging that will go
out.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13443-0
02:34:05.942 --> 02:34:06.182
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13455-0
02:34:08.449 --> 02:34:10.849
Visibility and access that's based on
permissioning.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13486-0
02:34:12.769 --> 02:34:16.209
If you provide us with a list of users
and the kind of level of access you want,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13486-1
02:34:16.209 --> 02:34:19.522
or if you want a supervisor view or
managerial view and what they can access,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13486-2
02:34:19.522 --> 02:34:21.009
we can start defining that for you.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13521-0
02:34:22.679 --> 02:34:24.590
In terms of being able to create tickets
as well,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13521-1
02:34:24.590 --> 02:34:26.271
you can do that within the agent
workspace.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13521-2
02:34:26.271 --> 02:34:28.143
Same way you can do submitting on the
front end.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13521-3
02:34:28.143 --> 02:34:31.161
We're just giving that functionality in
case you need to raise it for whatever

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13521-4
02:34:31.161 --> 02:34:32.919
reason.
You can also do it from the back end.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13553-0
02:34:34.019 --> 02:34:37.586
Sorry, just to clarify,
if the user goes onto the portal to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13553-1
02:34:37.586 --> 02:34:41.629
report light out, etcetera,
is that going straight to the engineers

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13553-2
02:34:41.629 --> 02:34:44.899
and ask connect are not involved Rick.
OK that's good.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13609-0
02:34:44.989 --> 02:34:48.732
We can give us connect visibility,
but again that's that's for you to tell

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13609-1
02:34:48.732 --> 02:34:52.125
us if you want us connect having
visibility of engineering task and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13609-2
02:34:52.125 --> 02:34:55.469
engineering to have visibility of these
tasks sitting with asking.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13610-0
02:34:55.909 --> 02:35:00.317
I don't we need divisibility of the user
is going to be able to track their

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13610-1
02:35:00.317 --> 02:35:01.709
request anyway they can.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13623-0
02:35:02.919 --> 02:35:06.639
Darren has it that has this ticket and
etcetera. No, I don't think we need.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13629-0
02:35:06.382 --> 02:35:08.250
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
I think that there is value in the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13629-1
02:35:08.250 --> 02:35:11.942
<v Mark Sedge>visibility because if say two people are
sitting under the desk and they haven't</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13629-2
02:35:11.942 --> 02:35:14.586
<v Mark Sedge>talked to each other,
one of them raises a ticket for the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13629-3
02:35:14.586 --> 02:35:17.867
<v Mark Sedge>flashing light through one route.
You then get one for the other route.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13629-4
02:35:17.867 --> 02:35:20.328
<v Mark Sedge>You could have a little look on the
system. Just say,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13629-5
02:35:20.328 --> 02:35:23.291
<v Mark Sedge>could this be a duplicate and do a check
and then just close it?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13629-6
02:35:23.291 --> 02:35:25.342
<v Mark Sedge>Or if it isn't a duplicate then progress
it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13634-0
02:35:25.822 --> 02:35:30.116
<v Mark Sedge>Some of that visibility enables you to
actually manage the record because you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13645-0
02:35:29.809 --> 02:35:33.689
I don't know, like I need to manage that.
It'll be. That'll be.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13634-1
02:35:30.116 --> 02:35:30.942
<v Mark Sedge>might you know.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13684-0
02:35:31.949 --> 02:35:34.017
No,
I think visibility with or engineering,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13684-1
02:35:34.017 --> 02:35:36.978
so everyone in engineering having
visibility would make sense.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13684-2
02:35:36.978 --> 02:35:39.516
But if Usconnect isn't picking it up or
actioning it,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13684-3
02:35:39.516 --> 02:35:43.134
it's just an additional admin view for
them which I don't know if that would

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13684-4
02:35:43.134 --> 02:35:45.672
really benefit, OK.
So we'll just keep it separate to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13683-0
02:35:45.489 --> 02:35:45.849
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13684-5
02:35:45.672 --> 02:35:46.189
workstream.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13693-0
02:35:46.959 --> 02:35:48.199
Does that work for you as well? Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13711-0
02:35:48.529 --> 02:35:49.249
Yeah, that's nice and.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13712-0
02:35:49.249 --> 02:35:52.582
Easy. So it's that visibility mark,
just with the engineering team rather

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13712-1
02:35:52.582 --> 02:35:54.969
than connect on that specific example you
mentioned.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13719-0
02:35:55.582 --> 02:35:58.607
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, OK. I'm as long as they.
As long as they're comfortable,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13719-1
02:35:58.607 --> 02:36:02.257
<v Mark Sedge>they wouldn't get anything via the
connect route that maybe the engineering</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13719-2
02:36:02.257 --> 02:36:06.194
<v Mark Sedge>team are already working on and therefore,
you'd want to associate that record or</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13719-3
02:36:06.194 --> 02:36:09.364
<v Mark Sedge>just close that record to say,
go back to that use and say, yeah,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13719-4
02:36:09.364 --> 02:36:12.341
<v Mark Sedge>they already know about it.
They're working on it, I suppose.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13719-5
02:36:12.341 --> 02:36:13.302
<v Mark Sedge>How would they know?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13722-0
02:36:13.622 --> 02:36:17.022
<v Mark Sedge>Would be the question and therefore how
could you manage the customer experience?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13745-0
02:36:17.669 --> 02:36:20.381
Then you just assign it to.
Engineering and engineering would say,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13745-1
02:36:20.381 --> 02:36:23.052
well, we're already dealing with this,
and then you close it off.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13741-0
02:36:21.739 --> 02:36:22.099
OK. Mm-hmm.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13745-2
02:36:23.052 --> 02:36:24.469
It would just be a manual activity.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13751-0
02:36:24.142 --> 02:36:28.425
<v Mark Sedge>But but if you OK so it it just means
that depending on if it was me,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13747-0
02:36:26.702 --> 02:36:26.942
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13751-1
02:36:28.425 --> 02:36:33.442
<v Mark Sedge>I'd want to be closing it as early off as
early as possible so that I didn't stop</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13751-2
02:36:33.442 --> 02:36:38.398
<v Mark Sedge>the engineer trying to fix the thing to
have to stop and then close that ticket.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13751-3
02:36:38.398 --> 02:36:40.662
<v Mark Sedge>Right. So as much as you do a triage.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13757-0
02:36:41.302 --> 02:36:43.838
<v Mark Sedge>You'd want to.
You'd want to do that operationally,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13757-1
02:36:43.838 --> 02:36:46.081
<v Mark Sedge>right?
So it's just something to think about.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13757-2
02:36:46.081 --> 02:36:49.690
<v Mark Sedge>I'm not saying it's right or wrong,
but typically you would have the full</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13757-3
02:36:49.690 --> 02:36:53.689
<v Mark Sedge>you'd be able to at least look and do a
quick search to say have has this already</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13757-4
02:36:53.689 --> 02:36:56.957
<v Mark Sedge>been reported? Are they already working?
Yes, they have closed it,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13757-5
02:36:56.957 --> 02:36:59.542
<v Mark Sedge>don't even send it to the guys.
Otherwise it's just.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13761-0
02:36:59.982 --> 02:37:03.022
<v Mark Sedge>You know admin task pushing down.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13789-0
02:37:01.599 --> 02:37:03.799
Will you do that for every task? Yeah,
because.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13785-0
02:37:04.069 --> 02:37:06.309
That's what. Yeah, that's what. Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13790-0
02:37:04.199 --> 02:37:04.639
The.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13791-0
02:37:05.079 --> 02:37:08.431
Quite a lot of work.
Wouldn't it be too much work?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13791-1
02:37:08.431 --> 02:37:09.679
I think the ask on.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13784-0
02:37:08.502 --> 02:37:08.862
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13793-0
02:37:08.862 --> 02:37:12.712
<v Mark Sedge>OK. Well, you'll you'll soon find out.
You'll soon find out as you run,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13793-1
02:37:12.712 --> 02:37:13.782
<v Mark Sedge>I can tell you this.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13799-0
02:37:13.342 --> 02:37:16.709
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I think it depends.
I think it depends on the knowledge piece</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13799-1
02:37:16.709 --> 02:37:20.837
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>from a connect perspective, right.
Because you know your e-mail may come in</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13799-2
02:37:20.837 --> 02:37:24.042
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>that's more verbatim around what people
are talking about.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13799-3
02:37:24.042 --> 02:37:28.062
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>They might not necessarily know like an
engineer with that it's the same.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13808-0
02:37:28.582 --> 02:37:32.892
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Asset, for example, that's the problem.
So I think either we connect or going to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13800-0
02:37:29.342 --> 02:37:29.742
<v Mark Sedge>True.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13808-1
02:37:32.892 --> 02:37:37.203
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>have an an effort piece because they're
either going to just send it straight to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13808-2
02:37:37.203 --> 02:37:41.513
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>M&amp;E and they'll make that decision,
or if they're going to need to check the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13808-3
02:37:41.513 --> 02:37:45.132
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>other outstanding tickets with
engineering and then make a informed</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13808-4
02:37:45.132 --> 02:37:46.942
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>decision that it's the same thing.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13811-0
02:37:47.262 --> 02:37:50.586
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>The rest would be that they're not
informed enough to make that decision.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13806-0
02:37:47.302 --> 02:37:47.582
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13811-1
02:37:50.586 --> 02:37:53.955
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>So I think until we get in a better place
from that knowledge perspective,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13811-2
02:37:53.955 --> 02:37:56.426
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>like you say,
it's maybe something we could streamline</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13811-3
02:37:56.426 --> 02:37:58.851
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>going forward,
but I would probably leave it that way</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13811-4
02:37:58.851 --> 02:38:01.502
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>for the engineer to make a decision in
the first instance.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13816-0
02:38:03.062 --> 02:38:05.696
<v Mark Sedge>Fair enough. I mean,
ultimately someone has to close the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13816-1
02:38:05.696 --> 02:38:07.822
<v Mark Sedge>record.
So it's just depends where you do it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13814-0
02:38:06.422 --> 02:38:06.662
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13824-0
02:38:10.999 --> 02:38:11.159
Cool.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13825-0
02:38:12.119 --> 02:38:13.919
I think we're all good on the workspace.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13831-0
02:38:15.489 --> 02:38:16.569
Wait, thanks mate. Sorry.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13829-0
02:38:15.649 --> 02:38:15.969
All right.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13843-0
02:38:17.479 --> 02:38:22.374
You PM.
So I think we've discussed the PPM

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13843-1
02:38:22.374 --> 02:38:23.399
schedule.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13884-0
02:38:24.969 --> 02:38:29.373
Function and ServiceNow briefly,
but ultimately we just want to give you a

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13884-1
02:38:29.373 --> 02:38:34.129
simple list view of the items that are
scheduled and coming up. And as you said,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13884-2
02:38:34.129 --> 02:38:36.771
it's monthly.
So based on a monthly trigger,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13884-3
02:38:36.771 --> 02:38:40.529
we'd have a ticket created assigned to
the engineering team or.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13899-0
02:38:41.529 --> 02:38:44.830
The assignment group and then you can
manually send it off to whoever needs to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13899-1
02:38:44.830 --> 02:38:45.289
pick it up.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13903-0
02:38:47.089 --> 02:38:48.689
The idea is that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13950-0
02:38:49.269 --> 02:38:52.809
And create a new schedule,
change its existing schedules when you

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13950-1
02:38:52.809 --> 02:38:57.099
select each one of these individual lines,
you can go in and identify if it's a

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13950-2
02:38:57.099 --> 02:39:00.157
statutory task. So what I said earlier,
if, like I said,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13950-3
02:39:00.157 --> 02:39:03.589
if it's a regulatory statutory,
you can export this the report.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/13963-0
02:39:04.489 --> 02:39:07.489
And identify the specific items that you
have to do as a mandatory.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14015-0
02:39:09.209 --> 02:39:13.242
This is just the structure I'd suggested,
so the task the asset we're hoping to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14015-1
02:39:13.242 --> 02:39:16.468
have the assets within here,
so you can directly link to it the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14015-2
02:39:16.468 --> 02:39:20.400
location do we want to have that as an
open text philtre align with the other

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14015-3
02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:23.323
one as well or do we want this to be more
of a drop down.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14015-4
02:39:23.323 --> 02:39:25.289
So you're reporting as more structured.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14043-0
02:39:26.869 --> 02:39:31.384
It's it's solely my guys that are gonna
be managing this. Part of it, isn't it?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14043-1
02:39:31.384 --> 02:39:33.980
Yeah.
There's no front front edge user to it,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14041-0
02:39:33.219 --> 02:39:33.339
No.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14043-2
02:39:33.980 --> 02:39:34.149
so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14071-0
02:39:37.919 --> 02:39:41.408
To be honest,
I'm trying to think what would be best,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14058-0
02:39:40.549 --> 02:39:42.629
We can circulate A darker shacks.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14071-1
02:39:41.408 --> 02:39:45.608
who would have the knowledge so we could
put free texting. Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14067-0
02:39:44.759 --> 02:39:45.399
Got the asset.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14071-2
02:39:45.608 --> 02:39:47.159
You got the asset there.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14080-0
02:39:50.039 --> 02:39:53.159
Do you want all three first fields to be
open text fields?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14082-0
02:39:53.319 --> 02:39:54.399
Yeah, I think.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14086-0
02:39:58.222 --> 02:39:59.462
<v Mark Sedge>Well, yeah, OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14095-0
02:40:00.339 --> 02:40:02.419
Associate location that will drive that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14096-0
02:40:02.619 --> 02:40:03.339
When we get there.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14151-0
02:40:03.889 --> 02:40:05.812
Yeah.
The other idea is if you have more

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14151-1
02:40:05.812 --> 02:40:09.565
structured data then you can start having
consistency with your assets and then

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14151-2
02:40:09.565 --> 02:40:11.629
that aligns with other parts of the
system.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14151-3
02:40:11.629 --> 02:40:13.928
So it becomes more of an enterprise
system tool.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14135-0
02:40:13.459 --> 02:40:14.099
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14151-4
02:40:13.928 --> 02:40:17.774
Whereas if you're doing open text field,
one of you might put code 1 of you might

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14151-5
02:40:17.774 --> 02:40:19.369
put the name one of you might put.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14159-0
02:40:19.499 --> 02:40:21.099
Yeah, it keeps it consistent.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14160-0
02:40:20.719 --> 02:40:20.959
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14163-0
02:40:22.609 --> 02:40:23.209
Selection there.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14169-0
02:40:23.599 --> 02:40:25.599
But when we said earlier about.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14190-0
02:40:27.319 --> 02:40:32.841
Third party jobs on regular maintenance.
Does that include cleaners and fully

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14192-0
02:40:32.019 --> 02:40:34.659
To start, subcontractors M&amp;
E subcontractors.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14190-1
02:40:32.841 --> 02:40:34.399
fully sub contractors?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14196-0
02:40:35.219 --> 02:40:35.939
Yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14218-0
02:40:39.339 --> 02:40:41.879
So back to the question,
do we want to open text field or do we

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14218-1
02:40:41.879 --> 02:40:44.299
want it more consistent and structured
and to have a bigger?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14265-0
02:40:44.089 --> 02:40:49.524
Yeah, I guess, I guess it would be, yeah,
more consistent if we had the drop downs,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14265-1
02:40:49.524 --> 02:40:50.689
OK, more specific.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14266-0
02:40:50.769 --> 02:40:53.799
It'll either be drop downs or as you're
typing it comes up with the verbs

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14248-0
02:40:53.049 --> 02:40:53.409
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14266-1
02:40:53.799 --> 02:40:57.033
suggested. Yeah, yeah, but but we'll,
we'll see what works best and we'll give

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14255-0
02:40:55.329 --> 02:40:55.489
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14266-2
02:40:57.033 --> 02:40:57.729
you a summary of.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14267-0
02:40:57.729 --> 02:40:59.929
The options available? Yes. OK. Yeah. OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14294-0
02:41:01.319 --> 02:41:05.657
Do the fields as the structured align
with what you'd expect to be able to edit

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14294-1
02:41:05.657 --> 02:41:08.639
the schedules?
Or is there anything obvious you could?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14297-0
02:41:08.099 --> 02:41:09.899
Yeah, no.
The rest of it looks OK actually.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14329-0
02:41:10.359 --> 02:41:13.228
OK, cool.
And then you'd have APPM workspace if you

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14329-1
02:41:13.228 --> 02:41:16.648
want to call it that way,
you'd have your frequency location.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14329-2
02:41:16.648 --> 02:41:20.565
What the asset is just in a condensed
view for a quick identification.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14321-0
02:41:19.429 --> 02:41:19.669
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14329-3
02:41:20.565 --> 02:41:21.999
If you want to call it up.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14328-0
02:41:22.109 --> 02:41:22.629
Yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14345-0
02:41:27.279 --> 02:41:30.879
Automatically flag in and violence. Good.
Good point, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14342-0
02:41:29.059 --> 02:41:29.339
Oh.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14395-0
02:41:31.879 --> 02:41:35.331
I'm not even reading my own slides at
this point, so yeah,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14395-1
02:41:35.331 --> 02:41:39.954
what we've suggested and a couple of the
other areas have also identified that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14395-2
02:41:39.954 --> 02:41:44.810
could be potentially beneficial based on
specific fields like due dates or if it's

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14395-3
02:41:44.810 --> 02:41:47.502
a particular asset we can put rules in
place.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14395-4
02:41:47.502 --> 02:41:49.959
So if it's a week due date for this asset.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14429-0
02:41:50.769 --> 02:41:53.011
Flag to.
I don't know your your head office,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14429-1
02:41:53.011 --> 02:41:56.948
your head of engineering or create the
ticket and send the e-mail notification

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14429-2
02:41:56.948 --> 02:42:00.087
out or whatever you think is most
pertinent in that situation.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14429-3
02:42:00.087 --> 02:42:02.329
We can do that.
So your risk of missing out.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14433-0
02:42:02.989 --> 02:42:03.709
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14434-0
02:42:03.559 --> 02:42:04.599
It's it's automated.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14447-0
02:42:05.509 --> 02:42:07.629
Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14496-0
02:42:07.129 --> 02:42:09.460
OK, cool.
It would be helpful if you guys could

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14496-1
02:42:09.460 --> 02:42:11.645
provide us with a list of these are our
top.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14496-2
02:42:11.645 --> 02:42:14.413
We can't afford them is the and then
based on due dates,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14474-0
02:42:13.599 --> 02:42:16.239
So yeah, yeah, yeah, we could do that,
yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14496-3
02:42:14.413 --> 02:42:17.959
we want to have these rules in place and
against whatever works for you.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14496-4
02:42:17.959 --> 02:42:21.941
If you want notifications we can do that.
If you want just to take it created and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14496-5
02:42:21.941 --> 02:42:23.009
assign we can do that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14533-0
02:42:23.439 --> 02:42:26.446
Just let us know what kind of works best
for you. We can give you suggestions,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14533-1
02:42:26.446 --> 02:42:28.159
but I think this is ultimately position
for.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14534-0
02:42:28.159 --> 02:42:28.999
You guys to make.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14518-0
02:42:29.269 --> 02:42:29.429
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14535-0
02:42:29.479 --> 02:42:32.719
I think that's why I can take away
tomorrow, guys, we'll come.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14536-0
02:42:32.719 --> 02:42:33.679
Back to you on that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14537-0
02:42:33.719 --> 02:42:35.159
Thank you very much.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14558-0
02:42:36.209 --> 02:42:38.474
Are we gonna be popular in this in the
system?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14558-1
02:42:38.474 --> 02:42:40.449
Are we gonna have to get an extract from?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14559-0
02:42:40.649 --> 02:42:43.129
Yeah. So that's that's that's the feature.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14573-0
02:42:42.869 --> 02:42:47.439
SFG funding. Yeah, I mean,
ideally that's what we work through.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14573-1
02:42:47.439 --> 02:42:49.509
So if we could align to that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14589-0
02:42:49.659 --> 02:42:51.721
Yeah,
I think we'll have a follow up will be

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14589-1
02:42:51.721 --> 02:42:54.699
the the various data extracts we need to
bring this to life, OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14591-0
02:42:55.129 --> 02:42:55.449
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14607-0
02:42:57.699 --> 02:43:01.090
Cool. Just double checking.
You haven't missed out any big other

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14607-1
02:43:01.090 --> 02:43:03.699
things. No. Yeah,
I think we're good on that one.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14610-0
02:43:02.719 --> 02:43:02.919
If.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14649-0
02:43:06.299 --> 02:43:09.135
OK,
I've tried to put a bit of a mobile view

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14649-1
02:43:09.135 --> 02:43:12.349
on the left,
it's just skewed because of my design

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14649-2
02:43:12.349 --> 02:43:17.328
work. That's not how it actually looks,
but that is roughly if you type in the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14649-3
02:43:17.328 --> 02:43:21.739
URL for ServiceNow on your mobiles,
it's not native apps for clarity.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14660-0
02:43:22.619 --> 02:43:25.177
This is that's kind of you.
You'll see on the left if you're in the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14660-1
02:43:25.177 --> 02:43:25.779
agent workspace.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14705-0
02:43:26.659 --> 02:43:31.053
If your operations look in your tickets
and you're able to look at your request

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14705-1
02:43:31.053 --> 02:43:35.063
there or your incidents and you can
manage it from there and then on the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14705-2
02:43:35.063 --> 02:43:39.677
right is bit of a TQR internal mock ups,
that's not what your ports will look like,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14705-3
02:43:39.677 --> 02:43:41.819
but it's there is a mobile view for it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14743-0
02:43:42.619 --> 02:43:44.707
Yeah.
So I think it sounds like that's more

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14743-1
02:43:44.707 --> 02:43:47.980
going to be pertinent if cleaners
etcetera come in in the future and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14743-2
02:43:47.980 --> 02:43:48.739
they'll be able.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14744-0
02:43:48.739 --> 02:43:48.819
To.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14745-0
02:43:48.819 --> 02:43:51.501
Manage from that over there and also in
the future phase.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14745-1
02:43:51.501 --> 02:43:53.997
We are looking at the native app
potentially as well.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14745-2
02:43:53.997 --> 02:43:55.939
So it'll be an better experience for them.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14753-0
02:43:57.219 --> 02:43:59.619
That probably lines up quite well
actually future phase.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14764-0
02:44:01.219 --> 02:44:03.829
I think I made that video, actually.
Let's see. Let's see.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14764-1
02:44:03.829 --> 02:44:04.979
Let's see what he's doing.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14780-0
02:44:08.339 --> 02:44:11.459
It's just the the outbox version,
so it's not the the prettiest,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14780-1
02:44:11.459 --> 02:44:13.379
but you can see all your stuff going on.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14785-0
02:44:15.179 --> 02:44:16.619
And then on the right is a little video.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14792-0
02:44:19.019 --> 02:44:20.099
Just because I like that design.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14793-0
02:44:21.219 --> 02:44:21.699
All right.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14797-0
02:44:23.259 --> 02:44:23.339
SL.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14795-0
02:44:23.342 --> 02:44:24.382
<v Mark Sedge>You're such a geek.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14801-0
02:44:27.089 --> 02:44:27.809
Hey, Joe.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14798-0
02:44:27.182 --> 02:44:27.302
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14809-0
02:44:30.219 --> 02:44:31.779
Hey, there's a compliment coping you up.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14811-0
02:44:32.062 --> 02:44:35.942
<v Mark Sedge>Of course I accept the same of myself.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14816-0
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:40.189
SLA's. Yeah, just.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14824-0
02:44:42.759 --> 02:44:45.559
You have to think it's just.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14863-0
02:44:45.729 --> 02:44:49.468
High level what we've pulled together,
there's a lot of gaps and we weren't sure

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14863-1
02:44:49.468 --> 02:44:51.823
exact timings,
but it's what we discussed earlier.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14863-2
02:44:51.823 --> 02:44:55.562
If you can provide to us whether we want
to include it as part of the initial or

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14863-3
02:44:55.562 --> 02:44:59.209
if we want to keep it separate phase one
and then introduce it slightly later.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14867-0
02:45:00.049 --> 02:45:00.889
Completely up to you guys.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14871-0
02:45:06.169 --> 02:45:06.409
And.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14879-0
02:45:10.159 --> 02:45:11.999
Yeah. I mean, I think.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14928-0
02:45:14.199 --> 02:45:16.879
I say I think people aren't speak to
yourself P2.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14928-1
02:45:16.879 --> 02:45:20.685
I would probably say it would be.
I mean we're we're quite responsive.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14928-2
02:45:20.685 --> 02:45:23.793
We're not focusing on anything else that
we're this site.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14928-3
02:45:23.793 --> 02:45:27.867
So we can be fairly quick on things.
Is that interaction with the end user,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14928-4
02:45:27.867 --> 02:45:30.279
I suppose in managing expectations maybe
AP.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14964-0
02:45:31.169 --> 02:45:35.314
Where we've got to maybe order some parts
or we're waiting on different time scales

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14964-1
02:45:35.314 --> 02:45:39.409
or we could be something to do with the
subcontractor. And here's attendance time.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14965-0
02:45:40.049 --> 02:45:40.089
I.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14966-0
02:45:40.089 --> 02:45:43.089
Mean so that that that's where it gets a
little bit.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15016-0
02:45:44.719 --> 02:45:49.219
We can also put in place conditional,
so if you put it on hold and then select

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/14985-0
02:45:48.979 --> 02:45:50.019
Like a pending option.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15016-1
02:45:49.219 --> 02:45:54.004
specific reason it stops the SLA and then
once you get your equipment over whatever

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15016-2
02:45:54.004 --> 02:45:57.250
we can also just put as a placeholder P11
to four hours,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15016-3
02:45:57.250 --> 02:45:58.959
P21 to 24 and then P-31 to 48.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15021-0
02:45:59.569 --> 02:45:59.849
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15045-0
02:46:00.379 --> 02:46:04.302
Again, decision for you guys to make,
but we can also just have a just to keep

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15045-1
02:46:04.302 --> 02:46:07.579
that reporting visibility P1 has been
successful 90% of the time.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15039-0
02:46:06.502 --> 02:46:06.702
<v Mark Sedge>So.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15053-0
02:46:08.222 --> 02:46:10.574
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.
One thing you might want to think about</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15053-1
02:46:10.574 --> 02:46:13.387
<v Mark Sedge>is if you put it on,
you can have some automatic text.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15053-2
02:46:13.387 --> 02:46:17.274
<v Mark Sedge>So if you selected on hold because you're
supplier needs to get some parts,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15053-3
02:46:17.274 --> 02:46:21.417
<v Mark Sedge>you could select that option and then a
notification could go out to the request</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15053-4
02:46:21.417 --> 02:46:24.742
<v Mark Sedge>to say thanks very much.
We're working on this this year and you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15053-5
02:46:24.742 --> 02:46:27.862
<v Mark Sedge>can have some scripted text.
So instead of you, your engine.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15051-0
02:46:25.109 --> 02:46:25.349
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15061-0
02:46:27.942 --> 02:46:31.461
<v Mark Sedge>Engineers having to, yeah,
actually have and type in that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15061-1
02:46:31.461 --> 02:46:36.375
<v Mark Sedge>interaction. You could have a pick list.
So I'm putting this on hold because I'm</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15061-2
02:46:36.375 --> 02:46:39.894
<v Mark Sedge>waiting for a part.
When I click that some a message goes</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15061-3
02:46:39.894 --> 02:46:44.748
<v Mark Sedge>into the record that the customer can see
that then says a very controlled text</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15059-0
02:46:41.979 --> 02:46:42.219
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15061-4
02:46:44.748 --> 02:46:47.782
<v Mark Sedge>that could be standard for each of those
on hold.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15063-0
02:46:47.902 --> 02:46:52.173
<v Mark Sedge>Options and that enables you, as I say,
to manage your customers expectations and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15063-1
02:46:52.173 --> 02:46:55.142
<v Mark Sedge>experience without having to do it,
if that makes sense.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15067-0
02:46:55.739 --> 02:46:57.179
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15070-0
02:46:58.822 --> 02:47:01.022
<v Mark Sedge>I've seen that work before really
effectively.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15069-0
02:46:59.079 --> 02:46:59.799
I'll be OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15073-0
02:47:01.349 --> 02:47:01.789
Yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15102-0
02:47:02.439 --> 02:47:04.996
And the PBM one then is that there's just
a due date.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15102-1
02:47:04.996 --> 02:47:06.559
It just needs to be done by will.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15103-0
02:47:06.559 --> 02:47:11.155
Not by people. Yeah, I mean, you know,
there's generally some flexibility around

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15103-1
02:47:11.155 --> 02:47:11.439
PPMS.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15138-0
02:47:12.669 --> 02:47:15.385
You know,
it could be done within the calendar

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15138-1
02:47:15.385 --> 02:47:18.042
month.
We're not going to be held accountable

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15138-2
02:47:18.042 --> 02:47:21.740
for it slipping through a day or two,
you know, so that's fine.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15138-3
02:47:21.740 --> 02:47:25.900
And and quite often, you know,
supply of attendance dates can change as

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15138-4
02:47:25.900 --> 02:47:26.189
well.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15143-0
02:47:26.719 --> 02:47:28.279
Is that even for statutory items?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15162-0
02:47:28.809 --> 02:47:33.172
Yeah, pretty much,
as long as it doesn't overrun weeks and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15162-1
02:47:33.172 --> 02:47:35.169
weeks, it's it's fairly OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15199-0
02:47:36.079 --> 02:47:39.738
We don't manage to file.
We can file on tests and things like that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15199-1
02:47:39.738 --> 02:47:43.725
that that's with the landlords.
So there's nothing that's weaker in sort

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15199-2
02:47:43.725 --> 02:47:48.039
of that we have to do at certain time,
9:30 on a Friday or anything like that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15204-0
02:47:48.819 --> 02:47:49.699
So this looks good.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15246-0
02:47:52.019 --> 02:47:54.613
But I think it's that worth having a
separate PPMSLA then,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15246-1
02:47:54.613 --> 02:47:57.867
because I'm assuming for your reactive
items you have to get on the ASAP,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15246-2
02:47:57.867 --> 02:48:00.637
whereas the PPM it doesn't sound like
you've got that now now.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15246-3
02:48:00.637 --> 02:48:03.099
So is it worth having a slightly
different P1P2 timing?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15247-0
02:48:03.669 --> 02:48:04.749
Yeah, sounds good.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15250-0
02:48:06.739 --> 02:48:07.219
Yeah, Angela.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15255-0
02:48:08.639 --> 02:48:09.839
I'll make a note of that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15268-0
02:48:10.609 --> 02:48:15.533
Or was it just become PPM is like AP3
because priority is yeah it needs to be

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15268-1
02:48:15.533 --> 02:48:15.849
done.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15280-0
02:48:17.499 --> 02:48:19.139
Why don't all the other stuff is done?
That's it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15301-0
02:48:18.879 --> 02:48:20.079
Yeah. Again with the PPMS, it's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15302-0
02:48:20.079 --> 02:48:20.399
All.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15303-0
02:48:20.679 --> 02:48:23.992
Front loaded, isn't it? I mean,
everything's going to hopefully be

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15303-1
02:48:23.992 --> 02:48:26.959
churning out each month.
So you're going to have that data.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15322-0
02:48:28.629 --> 02:48:30.729
And once it's in there,
I don't think it's going to change too

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15322-1
02:48:30.729 --> 02:48:31.029
much, OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15323-0
02:48:32.789 --> 02:48:36.389
Just want to be flagged in case somehow
something was missed.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15352-0
02:48:37.629 --> 02:48:40.189
Yeah, yeah,
you need to trigger if if something's

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15352-1
02:48:40.189 --> 02:48:44.130
missed and and and perhaps there is
something that needs to be built in here

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15352-2
02:48:44.130 --> 02:48:46.229
for that. If a supplier can't attempt to.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15359-0
02:48:46.102 --> 02:48:49.170
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So,
so actually if it helps some of what I've</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15359-1
02:48:49.170 --> 02:48:52.887
<v Mark Sedge>seen is it comes back to your
organisational tolerance, right.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15359-2
02:48:52.887 --> 02:48:57.844
<v Mark Sedge>But if often what they will do is they do,
you might have a trigger that says Oh no</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15359-3
02:48:57.844 --> 02:49:01.915
<v Mark Sedge>schedule date plus 10 day,
10 working days and it will just flag you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15359-4
02:49:01.915 --> 02:49:05.102
<v Mark Sedge>up a notification say this one hasn't
been scheduled.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15366-0
02:49:05.342 --> 02:49:08.981
<v Mark Sedge>Now if you know because they're an
engineer, was sick or something,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15366-1
02:49:08.981 --> 02:49:13.048
<v Mark Sedge>you're not worried you can reset it. Yeah,
there's mechanisms where you can</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15366-2
02:49:13.048 --> 02:49:15.402
<v Mark Sedge>basically just adjust the date
accordingly.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15366-3
02:49:15.402 --> 02:49:19.256
<v Mark Sedge>But that means that you don't have a
ticket drifting without you having</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15366-4
02:49:19.256 --> 02:49:22.413
<v Mark Sedge>visibility of it.
So I'm picking on 10 days because that's</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15366-5
02:49:22.413 --> 02:49:24.982
<v Mark Sedge>what I've seen done before.
To your point that.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15372-0
02:49:25.142 --> 02:49:27.636
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
and sometimes you can have a hard stop</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15372-1
02:49:27.636 --> 02:49:31.657
<v Mark Sedge>where you say I don't want to get into
the next calendar schedule because that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15372-2
02:49:31.657 --> 02:49:34.049
<v Mark Sedge>starts to compress your workload on the
teams.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15372-3
02:49:34.049 --> 02:49:37.765
<v Mark Sedge>So you might have an absolute one that
says it mustn't go past this the,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15372-4
02:49:37.765 --> 02:49:41.175
<v Mark Sedge>you know, into the next four month suite.
Right. Because as I say,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15372-5
02:49:41.175 --> 02:49:42.702
<v Mark Sedge>that impacts your engineering.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15375-0
02:49:43.222 --> 02:49:46.536
<v Mark Sedge>Self schedule of work so you can define
some of those rules.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15375-1
02:49:46.536 --> 02:49:48.982
<v Mark Sedge>We just need to know what your tolerance
is.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15389-0
02:49:50.639 --> 02:49:54.239
Yeah,
it turns 10 days sounds reasonable to.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15385-0
02:49:54.309 --> 02:49:54.629
Be fair.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15390-0
02:49:55.719 --> 02:49:56.919
I think that I think that would work.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15394-0
02:49:56.942 --> 02:50:00.142
<v Mark Sedge>It's typical.
I've seen several and it is typical.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15392-0
02:49:58.769 --> 02:49:59.129
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15411-0
02:50:01.179 --> 02:50:03.901
Yeah,
I think I think it's more so for probably

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15411-1
02:50:03.901 --> 02:50:07.019
for our Sabbath's where we don't have as
much control.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15410-0
02:50:07.782 --> 02:50:08.102
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15465-0
02:50:09.389 --> 02:50:13.120
And and you know that's how.
That's how effective we need to be with

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15465-1
02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:16.635
managing those responses.
Really we do have one or two suppliers

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15465-2
02:50:16.635 --> 02:50:19.393
that don't play ball as well as some of
the other.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15465-3
02:50:19.393 --> 02:50:23.665
So you know that that's something that I
I would take up an account an account

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15465-4
02:50:23.665 --> 02:50:27.829
management but if you've got that
tolerance like you say 10 out sounds good.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15512-0
02:50:29.269 --> 02:50:29.429
What?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15513-0
02:50:30.029 --> 02:50:34.510
We would roll this whole process out to
where the supplies get them to know that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15513-1
02:50:34.510 --> 02:50:37.220
you know,
expectations have changed a little bit

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15513-2
02:50:37.220 --> 02:50:39.709
now, yeah,
because we are firming things up.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15514-0
02:50:39.709 --> 02:50:40.549
You know, so.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15515-0
02:50:41.949 --> 02:50:46.364
Yeah, cool. So that answers the question.
So PPMSLA 10 days and the rest of them

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15515-1
02:50:46.364 --> 02:50:47.509
what we said earlier.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15533-0
02:50:48.289 --> 02:50:49.988
We'll circulate that afterwards as a
summary,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15533-1
02:50:49.988 --> 02:50:52.129
and if you want to change at any point,
just let us know.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15534-0
02:50:53.169 --> 02:50:54.129
Cool. Think we're good on that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15540-0
02:50:54.839 --> 02:50:56.919
Not be mapped to the types and whatnot.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15580-0
02:50:57.489 --> 02:50:58.129
OK.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15581-0
02:50:59.529 --> 02:51:03.225
So I'll give you guys a minute or two
just to quickly read through the reports,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15581-1
02:51:03.225 --> 02:51:06.228
so I'll I'll highlight the ones I think
are the most beneficial,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15581-2
02:51:06.228 --> 02:51:09.785
but I've just pulled these together based
on your best practise reports that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15581-3
02:51:09.785 --> 02:51:12.649
typically help identify bottlenecks,
optimise your processes.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15587-0
02:51:13.689 --> 02:51:15.143
Depth.
I'll give you a minute or two just to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15587-1
02:51:15.143 --> 02:51:15.369
review.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15624-0
02:51:51.999 --> 02:51:54.953
But that wasn't exactly a minute.
I tried to time it,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15624-1
02:51:54.953 --> 02:51:59.437
but it was just really, really to silence,
so I was not sure if everyone finished

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15624-2
02:51:59.437 --> 02:52:00.039
ultimately.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15631-0
02:51:59.719 --> 02:52:01.719
Can you get the gist by report name,
can't you?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15629-0
02:52:01.619 --> 02:52:01.699
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15687-0
02:52:03.339 --> 02:52:05.871
Ultimately,
some of them you probably won't be able

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15687-1
02:52:05.871 --> 02:52:09.035
to as part of phase one,
but if we do start bringing in external

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15687-2
02:52:09.035 --> 02:52:12.978
people, contractors and system, you can,
like the contractor performance for the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15687-3
02:52:12.978 --> 02:52:17.019
most part it will be kind of an internal
report you might add and talk about field

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15687-4
02:52:17.019 --> 02:52:20.135
work in progress, self-explanatory,
overdue, upcoming PPM task.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15687-5
02:52:20.135 --> 02:52:23.299
We've tried to give a little bit to
everything the reactive PPM.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15742-0
02:52:23.769 --> 02:52:27.416
And your contractors. So that again,
we'll send this out afterwards,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15742-1
02:52:27.416 --> 02:52:31.275
whatever you think is beneficial,
we can accommodate for as long as it's

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15742-2
02:52:31.275 --> 02:52:35.292
within phase one, part couple of them.
We probably won't be able to at this

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15742-3
02:52:35.292 --> 02:52:38.886
stage in time if there's additional
reports that you think could be

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15742-4
02:52:38.886 --> 02:52:43.062
beneficial. We haven't accounted for,
let us know and we'll also include those

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15742-5
02:52:43.062 --> 02:52:44.489
to optimise your processes.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15755-0
02:52:46.609 --> 02:52:47.729
Seem like a step forward.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15754-0
02:52:47.859 --> 02:52:49.859
Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, definitely.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15756-0
02:52:48.689 --> 02:52:49.089
It does.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15769-0
02:52:54.289 --> 02:52:56.529
Are we good to move on or do you have any
questions about reporting?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15772-0
02:52:55.389 --> 02:52:57.469
Yeah. No, it's good.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15805-0
02:52:57.889 --> 02:52:58.289
Which might.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15806-0
02:52:58.849 --> 02:53:03.516
Maybe to the next slide, please.
I think we've already discussed this

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15806-1
02:53:03.516 --> 02:53:08.116
quite in depth at this point,
but this is just what I imagined could

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15806-2
02:53:08.116 --> 02:53:12.382
look like in a perfect world,
you have emini go in realise, OK,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15806-3
02:53:12.382 --> 02:53:13.649
this is an IT item.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15837-0
02:53:14.509 --> 02:53:17.050
Let's raise it.
Let's identify ITIT aware are aware that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15837-1
02:53:17.050 --> 02:53:20.749
you're going to cut all the power in the
building and everything's going to go off

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15837-2
02:53:20.749 --> 02:53:22.309
and it's centralised in one system.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15855-0
02:53:23.219 --> 02:53:24.179
That's kind of the.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15856-0
02:53:24.179 --> 02:53:24.379
Ideal.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15857-0
02:53:25.299 --> 02:53:29.824
Target operating model you want to get to,
but we're aware there's a lot of change

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15857-1
02:53:29.824 --> 02:53:33.259
you're going to have to make and process
kind of efficiencies.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15866-0
02:53:34.809 --> 02:53:37.169
Because it's kind of how you understood
it as well in ideal world.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15872-0
02:53:37.302 --> 02:53:39.800
<v Mark Sedge>Well, the,
the the idea would be that you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15872-1
02:53:39.800 --> 02:53:44.016
<v Mark Sedge>facilities obviously operate as part of
the ITSM anyway, because you didn't for,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15872-2
02:53:44.016 --> 02:53:47.971
<v Mark Sedge>say, a power out for a whole building,
you'd raise a change request to that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15872-3
02:53:47.971 --> 02:53:51.146
<v Mark Sedge>because you'd want to.
You'd want to schedule it not only in</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15872-4
02:53:51.146 --> 02:53:54.633
<v Mark Sedge>line with when the the landlord or the
supply might be doing that,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15872-5
02:53:54.633 --> 02:53:55.622
<v Mark Sedge>but if for example.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15880-0
02:53:55.782 --> 02:53:59.626
<v Mark Sedge>There's a major server roll out on a site
and things like that.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15880-1
02:53:59.626 --> 02:54:04.731
<v Mark Sedge>You don't want to have the clash of those.
You know when the guys are trying to roll</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15880-2
02:54:04.731 --> 02:54:09.596
<v Mark Sedge>out certain componentry to it and then
they can't do it because there's no power</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15880-3
02:54:09.596 --> 02:54:12.659
<v Mark Sedge>whatever.
So there's aspects of this where we just</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15880-4
02:54:12.659 --> 02:54:15.542
<v Mark Sedge>need to sort of consider how much do we
do now.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15885-0
02:54:15.582 --> 02:54:20.187
<v Mark Sedge>Now or what? You know what do you have?
Because obviously I'm assuming certainly</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15885-1
02:54:20.187 --> 02:54:24.906
<v Mark Sedge>from what the IT content was that there's
you just talk to each other as an ad hoc</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15885-2
02:54:24.906 --> 02:54:28.318
<v Mark Sedge>when something pops up,
there's no necessarily formality of</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15885-3
02:54:28.318 --> 02:54:30.422
<v Mark Sedge>ticket transfer and things like that.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15894-0
02:54:30.742 --> 02:54:34.873
<v Mark Sedge>So what we might initially just do is
think is is lift the lid on that and just</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15894-1
02:54:34.873 --> 02:54:38.901
<v Mark Sedge>ask the questions around what would work.
What's an easy way of resolving it?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15894-2
02:54:38.901 --> 02:54:42.257
<v Mark Sedge>Because there is a there's the
opportunity or the potential that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15894-3
02:54:42.257 --> 02:54:46.337
<v Mark Sedge>customers might raise something as an IT
issue that need to come across to you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15894-4
02:54:46.337 --> 02:54:48.816
<v Mark Sedge>guys.
It wouldn't necessarily come through your</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15894-5
02:54:48.816 --> 02:54:50.262
<v Mark Sedge>form, it might come through.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15905-0
02:54:50.342 --> 02:54:53.540
<v Mark Sedge>Through the IT form,
or they might bring the help desk or</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15905-1
02:54:53.540 --> 02:54:56.187
<v Mark Sedge>whatever.
So we've just got to think about that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15905-2
02:54:56.187 --> 02:54:59.661
<v Mark Sedge>natural transfer and the logic would be
that you're, you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15905-3
02:54:59.661 --> 02:55:03.576
<v Mark Sedge>you're considered if you like,
another resolver group within the ITSM.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15905-4
02:55:03.576 --> 02:55:06.608
<v Mark Sedge>So you'd be, you know,
you'd just be another resolver,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15905-5
02:55:06.608 --> 02:55:09.862
<v Mark Sedge>something will come and get classified
and routed to your.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15911-0
02:55:09.902 --> 02:55:12.553
<v Mark Sedge>Team,
but you might get it as an instant ticket</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15911-1
02:55:12.553 --> 02:55:16.363
<v Mark Sedge>instead of a task ticket or case that
comes through the other route.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15911-2
02:55:16.363 --> 02:55:19.953
<v Mark Sedge>So we just need to think about
interoperability there. And yeah,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15911-3
02:55:19.953 --> 02:55:24.482
<v Mark Sedge>I've I've taken the action actually the
when we when we have the conversations or</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15911-4
02:55:24.482 --> 02:55:28.955
<v Mark Sedge>broadly about the asset and the locations
and some of those things that's needed</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15911-5
02:55:28.955 --> 02:55:29.342
<v Mark Sedge>for IT.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15918-0
02:55:29.942 --> 02:55:34.208
<v Mark Sedge>We'd have a little conversation about
show you a little bit of what the ITSM</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15918-1
02:55:34.208 --> 02:55:38.917
<v Mark Sedge>module does and see how because you might
turn around and say, well, actually, yeah,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15918-2
02:55:38.917 --> 02:55:42.906
<v Mark Sedge>we want to utilise some of that activity
and the only implication would</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15918-3
02:55:42.906 --> 02:55:47.338
<v Mark Sedge>potentially be a licence holder because
you'd need a certain role to be able to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15918-4
02:55:47.338 --> 02:55:49.222
<v Mark Sedge>receive those tickets and records.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15919-0
02:55:50.622 --> 02:55:51.662
<v Mark Sedge>Does that make sense?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15923-0
02:55:51.639 --> 02:55:52.279
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15930-0
02:55:53.502 --> 02:55:57.618
<v Mark Sedge>So and and I think so the and the the
issue that we have Josh is that if that's</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15930-1
02:55:57.618 --> 02:56:00.037
<v Mark Sedge>a task,
if it's a task that needs to go to IT,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15930-2
02:56:00.037 --> 02:56:03.845
<v Mark Sedge>that task would need to generate an
incident right for them to be able to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15930-3
02:56:03.845 --> 02:56:07.344
<v Mark Sedge>pick it up and take it through the
instant cycle with the right SLA</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15930-4
02:56:07.344 --> 02:56:11.358
<v Mark Sedge>reporting and other bits and pieces.
Hence why I'm suggesting there is one of</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15930-5
02:56:11.358 --> 02:56:12.902
<v Mark Sedge>those sort of things the idea.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15932-0
02:56:12.942 --> 02:56:16.884
<v Mark Sedge>The deal would be that you already put it
in as part of ITS. Yeah,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15932-1
02:56:16.884 --> 02:56:20.062
<v Mark Sedge>you already operate it within that module
capability.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15952-0
02:56:18.269 --> 02:56:22.849
Good day. Mark,
are you talking like architecture about

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15952-1
02:56:22.849 --> 02:56:27.429
actually using the ITSM module or just
borrowing logic?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15956-0
02:56:26.662 --> 02:56:29.784
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. Yeah, just yeah,
these guys could be another resolver</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15956-1
02:56:29.784 --> 02:56:32.542
<v Mark Sedge>group with the right role. They would see,
you know,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15956-2
02:56:32.542 --> 02:56:36.757
<v Mark Sedge>they would basically just get if there
was an instance came into IT for example,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15956-3
02:56:36.757 --> 02:56:41.128
<v Mark Sedge>and IT looked and said actually, you know,
somebody said this isn't working when we</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15956-4
02:56:41.128 --> 02:56:42.742
<v Mark Sedge>get there, you know, there's a.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15962-0
02:56:43.102 --> 02:56:47.163
<v Mark Sedge>Someone's cut through the power cable or
whatever it happens to be that needs</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15962-1
02:56:47.163 --> 02:56:50.496
<v Mark Sedge>facilities to do something.
They would then just assign that to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15962-2
02:56:50.496 --> 02:56:54.089
<v Mark Sedge>Facilities group. The M&amp;
E team would just pick it up, go solve.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15962-3
02:56:54.089 --> 02:56:57.422
<v Mark Sedge>And you know there's some. There's some.
There's some logic in.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15968-0
02:56:58.382 --> 02:57:01.187
<v Mark Sedge>You know, again,
if we're thinking about enterprise and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15968-1
02:57:01.187 --> 02:57:04.994
<v Mark Sedge>we're thinking about simplification,
some customers already have a routine.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15968-2
02:57:04.994 --> 02:57:07.199
<v Mark Sedge>We've already got, like AIT,
support route,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15968-3
02:57:07.199 --> 02:57:09.804
<v Mark Sedge>you could quite easily have you use the
same route,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15968-4
02:57:09.804 --> 02:57:13.861
<v Mark Sedge>have a I'm not trying to solution here,
but I'm just trying to present to you to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15968-5
02:57:13.861 --> 02:57:14.062
<v Mark Sedge>the.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15974-0
02:57:14.542 --> 02:57:18.028
<v Mark Sedge>The enterprise level you you might have,
you know? Sure.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15974-1
02:57:18.028 --> 02:57:22.309
<v Mark Sedge>If something's not working,
we could have an expand that to say is IT</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15974-2
02:57:22.309 --> 02:57:25.795
<v Mark Sedge>facilities thing and bring it all through
the same room.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15974-3
02:57:25.795 --> 02:57:29.037
<v Mark Sedge>It's something to think about.
I'm not saying do it,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15974-4
02:57:29.037 --> 02:57:32.462
<v Mark Sedge>but I think that when we look at it as a
further phase.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15981-0
02:57:32.702 --> 02:57:36.321
<v Mark Sedge>So I'm looking at it and Alex,
challenge me if you disagree.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15981-1
02:57:36.321 --> 02:57:40.653
<v Mark Sedge>I'm saying in principle what you're
operating there when you think about</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15981-2
02:57:40.653 --> 02:57:45.341
<v Mark Sedge>passing that ticket to IT somehow, Josh,
we've got to get that ticket into the</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15981-3
02:57:45.341 --> 02:57:48.664
<v Mark Sedge>incident process because it's likely to
be an incident.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15981-4
02:57:48.664 --> 02:57:52.462
<v Mark Sedge>It's not likely to be a request.
It will be something reactive.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15989-0
02:57:52.662 --> 02:57:56.856
<v Mark Sedge>We just think to think about systemically
how we do that phase first phase.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15989-1
02:57:56.856 --> 02:58:01.050
<v Mark Sedge>But then when perhaps we have the
conversation broadly about some and we're</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15989-2
02:58:01.050 --> 02:58:05.464
<v Mark Sedge>able to show you actually typically what
you have when you're looking at assets</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15989-3
02:58:05.464 --> 02:58:09.989
<v Mark Sedge>configuration and some of that it might
be that we just retire that route and you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15989-4
02:58:09.989 --> 02:58:12.142
<v Mark Sedge>embrace that one phase two phase three.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/15990-0
02:58:12.182 --> 02:58:12.902
<v Mark Sedge>Or something.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16034-0
02:58:13.409 --> 02:58:16.570
Yeah. No,
I I definitely think there's some value

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16034-1
02:58:16.570 --> 02:58:19.668
in, in,
in tying it and facilities together with

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16034-2
02:58:19.668 --> 02:58:23.778
certain aspects because you know,
just just recently UPS battery

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16034-3
02:58:23.778 --> 02:58:27.066
replacement.
I mean that had a big impact on the IT

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16034-4
02:58:27.066 --> 02:58:29.089
guys potentially, but there was.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16033-0
02:58:27.702 --> 02:58:29.222
<v Mark Sedge>Yep, Yep.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16067-0
02:58:29.429 --> 02:58:34.487
Ordered as such from their point of view,
apart from just e-mail correspondence.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16067-1
02:58:34.487 --> 02:58:39.358
So you know to have something formalised
within either one of the platforms I

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16067-2
02:58:39.358 --> 02:58:41.669
think is is is quite important, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16066-0
02:58:42.502 --> 02:58:42.902
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16087-0
02:58:43.439 --> 02:58:51.396
Maybe Mark even licence wise what you
have for the ITL user additional you'd

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16087-1
02:58:51.396 --> 02:58:53.359
save on the tables.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16094-0
02:58:51.862 --> 02:58:56.524
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, I think so. And and and yeah,
and as I say, Josh, I didn't want to.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16088-0
02:58:53.359 --> 02:58:54.039
To look into.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16094-1
02:58:56.524 --> 02:59:00.683
<v Mark Sedge>I didn't want to step on any toes in
terms of where you're going,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16094-2
02:59:00.683 --> 02:59:04.274
<v Mark Sedge>what you could,
but we ought to think every time we said</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16094-3
02:59:04.274 --> 02:59:08.622
<v Mark Sedge>we we need to be thinking what's the
what's the enterprise solution.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16093-0
02:59:04.939 --> 02:59:05.379
Right, yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16101-0
02:59:09.182 --> 02:59:11.795
<v Mark Sedge>And what's that?
What's also going to be really</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16101-1
02:59:11.795 --> 02:59:16.261
<v Mark Sedge>sustainable and where's the where's the
sort of harmonised value and some of that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16101-2
02:59:16.261 --> 02:59:19.310
<v Mark Sedge>would be just embracing what we know
we've already got?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16101-3
02:59:19.310 --> 02:59:23.231
<v Mark Sedge>So Ashley and his team would still have
config items. They'd have your,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16101-4
02:59:23.231 --> 02:59:27.587
<v Mark Sedge>their service would be defined in the
CMDB tickets could be logged against that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16101-5
02:59:27.587 --> 02:59:28.622
<v Mark Sedge>service, naturally.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16108-0
02:59:29.302 --> 02:59:33.672
<v Mark Sedge>When an agent say they helped us do pick
up something, they click that service.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16108-1
02:59:33.672 --> 02:59:36.677
<v Mark Sedge>It automatically fires up the group,
their mini group,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16108-2
02:59:36.677 --> 02:59:40.118
<v Mark Sedge>and then ultimately they just select that
fire the ticket off,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16108-3
02:59:40.118 --> 02:59:44.270
<v Mark Sedge>put a note in and then you've got
management of that visibility of that and</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16108-4
02:59:44.270 --> 02:59:46.947
<v Mark Sedge>alignment.
And then if facilities need something</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16108-5
02:59:46.947 --> 02:59:48.422
<v Mark Sedge>being done with it or they.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16117-0
02:59:48.502 --> 02:59:53.074
<v Mark Sedge>You need to raise a change request to say
we're going to update all of these</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16117-1
02:59:53.074 --> 02:59:56.103
<v Mark Sedge>devices because you'd have your UPS's in
the CMDB.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16117-2
02:59:56.103 --> 02:59:59.488
<v Mark Sedge>You'd have all maybe your AC handling
units in the CMDB.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16117-3
02:59:59.488 --> 03:00:03.942
<v Mark Sedge>If you're doing maintenance on AC.
If you've got tech rooms and tech rooms</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16114-0
03:00:02.119 --> 03:00:02.279
Yep.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16117-4
03:00:03.942 --> 03:00:07.862
<v Mark Sedge>as I described talked about earlier,
quite critical AC for those.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16124-0
03:00:08.182 --> 03:00:11.711
<v Mark Sedge>You'd have those in there,
so again it gives you you the ability to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16124-1
03:00:11.711 --> 03:00:15.915
<v Mark Sedge>see when you're scheduling something.
You can look in the change mechanism, say,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16124-2
03:00:15.915 --> 03:00:18.926
<v Mark Sedge>oh, hang on a minute,
there's loads of it stuff going on.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16124-3
03:00:18.926 --> 03:00:22.507
<v Mark Sedge>Let's delay that for a month.
Or you can say, yeah, it's dead clear.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16124-4
03:00:22.507 --> 03:00:25.466
<v Mark Sedge>This is free run.
And then anybody in it scheduling will</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16124-5
03:00:25.466 --> 03:00:27.542
<v Mark Sedge>see your changes are going in. So we'll.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16126-0
03:00:27.662 --> 03:00:32.239
<v Mark Sedge>Avoid that we do have it. You know,
there's a lot of harmonisation that can</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16126-1
03:00:32.239 --> 03:00:33.022
<v Mark Sedge>be exploited.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16130-0
03:00:33.999 --> 03:00:34.239
Yeah.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16134-0
03:00:34.782 --> 03:00:37.022
<v Mark Sedge>If we think of the whole.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16142-0
03:00:35.319 --> 03:00:36.119
It's all sensitive.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16143-0
03:00:36.479 --> 03:00:39.159
Yeah, but I I think to your point, that's.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16141-0
03:00:37.902 --> 03:00:40.662
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I think this conversation. Oh, sorry,
Alex.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16152-0
03:00:41.399 --> 03:00:43.289
I don't know.
I was just going to say I think that is

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16161-0
03:00:42.382 --> 03:00:44.975
<v Mark Sedge>I'm not saying it's this phase.
I'll keep stressing,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16152-1
03:00:43.289 --> 03:00:43.639
very much.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16183-0
03:00:44.049 --> 03:00:48.040
No, absolutely not. I do think.
I do think they think you know the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16161-1
03:00:44.975 --> 03:00:47.862
<v Mark Sedge>not necessarily right now.
Let's get off chair well first.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16183-1
03:00:48.040 --> 03:00:52.686
thinking is right and that we need to
define what the road map looks like and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16183-2
03:00:52.686 --> 03:00:55.009
then where that landing point might be.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16223-0
03:00:55.419 --> 03:00:59.933
Because to your point, UPS monitoring,
for example that can be set up to trigger

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16223-1
03:00:59.933 --> 03:01:04.113
an alert and all the rest of it.
So there's loads of opportunities in that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16207-0
03:01:03.142 --> 03:01:03.382
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16223-2
03:01:04.113 --> 03:01:08.739
journey and it's just picking the right
time to to adopt that and take it forward.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16216-0
03:01:07.302 --> 03:01:07.622
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16229-0
03:01:09.502 --> 03:01:12.702
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So go on, Joe. Yeah, sorry.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16228-0
03:01:09.809 --> 03:01:11.649
What a joke. I don't need to jump in.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16238-0
03:01:12.742 --> 03:01:16.604
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I was just going to say this is a whole N
10 conversation, right?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16238-1
03:01:16.604 --> 03:01:21.345
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>This is what actually drives where these
from a service level like we're looking</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16238-2
03:01:21.345 --> 03:01:25.793
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>at this at process level because that's
existing how it sits at the moment,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16233-0
03:01:25.502 --> 03:01:25.822
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16238-3
03:01:25.793 --> 03:01:30.416
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>but service catalogue and service design
should eventually bring this together</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16238-4
03:01:30.416 --> 03:01:32.582
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>from an N10 perspective and actually.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16243-0
03:01:32.742 --> 03:01:37.286
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>About where does this journey start?
So if we think about the employee portal</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16243-1
03:01:37.286 --> 03:01:41.948
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>as somebody coming up and saying, oh,
I've got a problem with this or I need to</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16243-2
03:01:41.948 --> 03:01:44.978
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>do this etcetera.
But you're not necessarily going,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16243-3
03:01:44.978 --> 03:01:48.357
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>this needs to go to facilities or this
needs to go to IT.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16243-4
03:01:48.357 --> 03:01:50.222
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>They're just asking the request.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16244-0
03:01:49.782 --> 03:01:51.222
<v Mark Sedge>Correct, correct.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16248-0
03:01:50.582 --> 03:01:55.615
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>And it's up to us to understand where the
start of that process is and whether who</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16254-0
03:01:53.982 --> 03:01:58.732
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, but the problem is Joe, you've got.
Sorry, the problem you've also got is you,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16248-1
03:01:55.615 --> 03:01:56.222
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>owns them.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16254-1
03:01:58.732 --> 03:02:01.358
<v Mark Sedge>you're going to have several routes in,
right?</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16251-0
03:02:01.302 --> 03:02:01.582
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16254-2
03:02:01.358 --> 03:02:05.605
<v Mark Sedge>You they could come in via an ask group
or they could come in direct to IT.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16254-3
03:02:05.605 --> 03:02:09.182
<v Mark Sedge>You know, so all connect, you know.
But the point here is that.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16261-0
03:02:10.102 --> 03:02:14.504
<v Mark Sedge>And you're right about the the overall
design from our perspective,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16261-1
03:02:14.504 --> 03:02:18.324
<v Mark Sedge>all I'm calling out is that we we said
right at the start,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16261-2
03:02:18.324 --> 03:02:23.503
<v Mark Sedge>somehow Josh has got to get that ticket
into the IT team if the if the if these</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16261-3
03:02:23.503 --> 03:02:28.424
<v Mark Sedge>guys say this needs IT involvement,
we've got to find a way of getting that</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16261-4
03:02:28.424 --> 03:02:28.942
<v Mark Sedge>into IT.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16269-0
03:02:29.462 --> 03:02:33.287
<v Mark Sedge>Right from the off. So what?
I'm just calling out is that we know</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16262-0
03:02:31.662 --> 03:02:31.942
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yep.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16269-1
03:02:33.287 --> 03:02:37.344
<v Mark Sedge>we've got an instant form for IT.
It could be that Josh's output just</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16269-2
03:02:37.344 --> 03:02:42.155
<v Mark Sedge>populates the same form that then comes
through that as if a customer would do it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16269-3
03:02:42.155 --> 03:02:45.574
<v Mark Sedge>But we automate it.
So all I'm calling out is we will work</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16269-4
03:02:45.574 --> 03:02:48.530
<v Mark Sedge>that through,
but I am suggesting and I'm not sure</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16269-5
03:02:48.530 --> 03:02:49.342
<v Mark Sedge>who's driving.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16275-0
03:02:49.422 --> 03:02:54.100
<v Mark Sedge>In your service design,
who's your Smas but you're you, you, you,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16275-1
03:02:54.100 --> 03:02:57.219
<v Mark Sedge>you,
they need to be thinking as I would be</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16275-2
03:02:57.219 --> 03:03:02.961
<v Mark Sedge>thinking in that service architecture to
get you to the outcome because what you</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16275-3
03:03:02.961 --> 03:03:06.222
<v Mark Sedge>don't want to do is look at it say from
just.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16282-0
03:03:06.782 --> 03:03:10.955
<v Mark Sedge>Your route in you've got to look at it
that you you don't know how the customers</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16282-1
03:03:10.955 --> 03:03:13.995
<v Mark Sedge>are going to behave.
They might raise an IT one they might</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16282-2
03:03:13.995 --> 03:03:16.931
<v Mark Sedge>raise, you know, come straight to art.
As I said before,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16282-3
03:03:16.931 --> 03:03:19.456
<v Mark Sedge>they've got to look at that in the whole
design.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16282-4
03:03:19.456 --> 03:03:21.929
<v Mark Sedge>But ultimately this is about operational
stuff.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16282-5
03:03:21.929 --> 03:03:25.742
<v Mark Sedge>This is about how Ashley and the IT teams
can flu with level of fluidity.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16289-0
03:03:26.182 --> 03:03:29.157
<v Mark Sedge>Manage their infrastructure outside of
the customer.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16289-1
03:03:29.157 --> 03:03:32.694
<v Mark Sedge>They're doing something where they're
going to raise a change.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16289-2
03:03:32.694 --> 03:03:37.241
<v Mark Sedge>They're going to take power down or it's
going to impact technology that is ring</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16289-3
03:03:37.241 --> 03:03:41.957
<v Mark Sedge>fenced within that can all be done within
ITSM with no customer visibility, but we,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16289-4
03:03:41.957 --> 03:03:45.382
<v Mark Sedge>but the two teams can operate with
visibility. We know what.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16291-0
03:03:45.502 --> 03:03:48.744
<v Mark Sedge>Happened. We know why something happened.
We know how to schedule it.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16291-1
03:03:48.744 --> 03:03:50.967
<v Mark Sedge>That's a different.
It's a different challenge.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16291-2
03:03:50.967 --> 03:03:51.662
<v Mark Sedge>You're with me.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16301-0
03:03:52.462 --> 03:03:55.694
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I understand what you're talking about
operationally for now,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16301-1
03:03:55.694 --> 03:03:58.821
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>I'm just talking about longer term from
an N10 perspective.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16301-2
03:03:58.821 --> 03:04:02.991
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>That's something that will come down the
line and we'll be able to manage that.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16296-0
03:04:02.102 --> 03:04:02.462
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16301-3
03:04:02.991 --> 03:04:05.546
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>But yeah,
we need to obviously think about what,</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16301-4
03:04:05.546 --> 03:04:09.716
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>how it happens at the moment and how we
replicate that and service now and make</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16301-5
03:04:09.716 --> 03:04:12.062
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>sure that work passes between the two
teams.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16307-0
03:04:14.022 --> 03:04:16.339
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>Yeah,
I think it's not a priority for service</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16307-1
03:04:16.339 --> 03:04:19.967
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>design at the moment in terms of
facilities in IT. As far as I'm aware.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16307-2
03:04:19.967 --> 03:04:23.897
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>But it is something that we will need to
look at and that will come naturally</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16304-0
03:04:23.022 --> 03:04:23.462
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16307-3
03:04:23.897 --> 03:04:25.862
<v Collins, Gillian 14363>through that service capital apartment.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16305-0
03:04:26.262 --> 03:04:27.142
<v Mark Sedge>Cool. OK.</v>

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16310-0
03:04:29.299 --> 03:04:30.419
All aligned on that one.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16355-0
03:04:32.139 --> 03:04:34.866
Where we at? OK,
we're doing quite well time.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16355-1
03:04:34.866 --> 03:04:39.254
So just some some final pieces. Really.
That's that's the bulk of the the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16355-2
03:04:39.254 --> 03:04:42.396
workshop.
This is just what's what's happening next.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16355-3
03:04:42.396 --> 03:04:46.606
So today we were designing,
we will publish some of what we discussed.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16355-4
03:04:46.606 --> 03:04:48.859
It will include actions for ourselves.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16371-0
03:04:49.859 --> 03:04:52.698
We'll also let you guys know when we get
there.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16371-1
03:04:52.698 --> 03:04:55.419
Any extracts that we need of data
categories?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16385-0
03:04:57.219 --> 03:05:00.385
What's next on the whole asset piece and
stuff like that? Parking lot items,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16385-1
03:05:00.385 --> 03:05:01.619
which is a few important ones.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16437-0
03:05:02.429 --> 03:05:05.298
And then we're gonna go next week into
user story drafting.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16437-1
03:05:05.298 --> 03:05:08.979
So this is where Marvin's gonna be
writing how the system will work based on

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16437-2
03:05:08.979 --> 03:05:11.752
today's conversation.
And then that'll be for you guys to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16437-3
03:05:11.752 --> 03:05:15.099
review. But I get make sense.
That's what we talked about that works.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16437-4
03:05:15.099 --> 03:05:16.629
And we'll walk you through that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16455-0
03:05:17.539 --> 03:05:19.997
So we'll take you through it step by step,
and once there,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16455-1
03:05:19.997 --> 03:05:22.539
there'll be various batches of those over
the coming months.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16465-0
03:05:24.339 --> 03:05:28.099
And then once that is done,
we will get into build.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16481-0
03:05:29.739 --> 03:05:31.955
We have we have space there for ad hoc
design sessions.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16481-1
03:05:31.955 --> 03:05:33.499
I don't think we're going to need them.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16486-0
03:05:35.179 --> 03:05:36.419
Here we have it.
I think we're quite clear.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16504-0
03:05:36.049 --> 03:05:36.769
OK, alright, I think.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16505-0
03:05:36.969 --> 03:05:39.637
I think the solution's quite self
expenditure at this point.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16505-1
03:05:39.637 --> 03:05:41.649
We'll just circulate some additional MOP
ups.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16528-0
03:05:41.799 --> 03:05:43.682
Yeah, there's some. Yeah.
So can I mock ups?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16528-1
03:05:43.682 --> 03:05:47.030
But they'll be put piece on the follow up
stuff like the the asset conversation

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16528-2
03:05:47.030 --> 03:05:49.039
that we'll have of course and things like
that.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16578-0
03:05:50.579 --> 03:05:52.619
But for design, yeah,
I think I think we're.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16579-0
03:05:52.619 --> 03:05:52.979
Good.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16581-0
03:05:53.619 --> 03:05:58.022
And then coming out a little bit,
so design will conclude that around Feb

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16581-1
03:05:58.022 --> 03:06:02.781
and then the the blue highlighted ones
are pretty ones that you guys care about

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16581-2
03:06:02.781 --> 03:06:03.019
the.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16571-0
03:06:03.019 --> 03:06:03.219
Most.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16582-0
03:06:03.619 --> 03:06:06.819
So by the end of the start of August,
sorry, we'll want to conclude.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16610-0
03:06:07.739 --> 03:06:11.697
Testing that you guys will be involved in
testing and be able to see the system

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16610-1
03:06:11.697 --> 03:06:14.418
we've built,
we're actually actually before that we're

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16610-2
03:06:14.418 --> 03:06:17.139
going to do sprints of build.
So we do 2 week sprints.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16651-0
03:06:18.039 --> 03:06:18.559
Maybe for mom.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16652-0
03:06:19.399 --> 03:06:22.956
I'll build at the end of each of those.
You'll be able to see what we've built

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16652-1
03:06:22.956 --> 03:06:26.647
and you'll be able to have a look and say
that makes sense or that needs tweaking

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16652-2
03:06:26.647 --> 03:06:29.574
so you'll be able to see relatively
quickly what we're building.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16652-3
03:06:29.574 --> 03:06:30.879
So it's an iterative process.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16697-0
03:06:32.979 --> 03:06:36.797
Written down this how it's going to work
and then we build it. Then you review it,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16697-1
03:06:36.797 --> 03:06:39.419
you say yeah or nay and we build the next
bit. Yeah, or.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16698-0
03:06:39.419 --> 03:06:39.779
Nay.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16699-0
03:06:39.779 --> 03:06:43.363
And then we get to an end to end testing
phase where you'll be able to test the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16699-1
03:06:43.363 --> 03:06:44.259
full system that it.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16700-0
03:06:44.259 --> 03:06:44.579
Works.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16701-0
03:06:44.579 --> 03:06:47.939
As it needs to and then we do training
for anyone that needs.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16710-0
03:06:48.979 --> 03:06:51.046
Your teams to to use it,
we'll show them how to do those bits that

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16710-1
03:06:51.046 --> 03:06:51.539
we talked about.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16725-0
03:06:52.519 --> 03:06:55.869
And then there we go live next,
next September. That's a hard date.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16725-1
03:06:55.869 --> 03:06:57.199
So that's what we're doing.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16730-0
03:06:58.399 --> 03:06:59.639
And then we're operational.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16744-0
03:07:01.409 --> 03:07:03.889
And then we can think about phase 2IN
different locations.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16745-0
03:07:03.889 --> 03:07:04.009
And.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16746-0
03:07:04.529 --> 03:07:05.449
Different kind of pieces of.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16786-0
03:07:07.129 --> 03:07:08.489
Change. Ruth, are you happy to do you?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16787-0
03:07:08.489 --> 03:07:13.297
Want to do you want to? Yeah.
I think we've come to some conclusions,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16787-1
03:07:13.297 --> 03:07:18.035
which is let's focus on London.
Let's get that right or focus on the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16787-2
03:07:18.035 --> 03:07:23.049
globalisation sanitisation. The phase two,
I think in terms of the form.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16798-0
03:07:23.969 --> 03:07:27.569
It was keep it simple and we can iterate
and make it more.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16859-0
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:31.952
Detailed as required,
I think there's a third thing with the

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16859-1
03:07:31.952 --> 03:07:36.729
reports. I think it's a common theme.
I quite liked this workshop that you only

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16859-2
03:07:36.729 --> 03:07:39.834
had these reports and you guys didn't ask
for more,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16859-3
03:07:39.834 --> 03:07:43.238
but it would be good maybe to help
yourselves. Actually,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16859-4
03:07:43.238 --> 03:07:48.075
when you said there's certain themes or
you weren't able to highlight themes and

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16859-5
03:07:48.075 --> 03:07:49.269
things, but I think.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16900-0
03:07:49.799 --> 03:07:54.314
I think that would be seen as an added
advantage. Those with the key bits. Yeah,

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16900-1
03:07:54.314 --> 03:07:58.829
I think those were the three key themes
that obviously we talked about different

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16900-2
03:07:58.829 --> 03:08:03.289
processes and the schedules and stuff,
but you'll see that in the in the impact

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16900-3
03:08:03.289 --> 03:08:03.679
report.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16945-0
03:08:08.049 --> 03:08:08.409
I'm good.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16946-0
03:08:08.409 --> 03:08:11.110
For me, Josh,
when are we expecting these stories to

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16946-1
03:08:11.110 --> 03:08:12.129
land for review and?

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16947-0
03:08:12.329 --> 03:08:13.129
When you've been.

a02e3aa1-3c50-471a-b0ce-f3c05771fcab/16948-0
03:08:13.129 --> 03:08:15.678

Building something wrong? We'll check.
It's correct.
