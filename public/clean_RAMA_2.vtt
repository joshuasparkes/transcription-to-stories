That's only where my point is. We think as a team: we join the dots and challenge what you do. For ServiceNow to get to BAU, there will be another overlay. What we discussed today might be challenged back — you'll be asked to do things again and it will be reworked. That's how we'll approach it as a team.

The request is to create a master cutting, and there are often requests to change rates. On the request form we need a way to capture multiple items but still treat them as one group. Ideally, a single request could contain multiple tasks. Users could select "add another" in the same field and submit multiple related requests linked to the initial point of contact. That way you can solve each associated task, especially if they're of a similar model.

We should be able to log each task separately because one might take 10 minutes and another half a day. Tracking start and finish for each is important for demand management and planning. The subject line is also important for us — for example, "Please make the mark cut" or "Please add the rate." Right now we can only select one option, but we can capture rates, currency and have individual tasks under a parent request. PES — if needed — users can add another change. It’s more of a management question, and particularly when OCM comes in. We need to get users to go into the portal; it's a change for them.

The biggest problem is we’re not able to track work properly. If you look at the dashboard, we’re sitting at around 60%. That’s a pain point for Gerald and for others. A major issue is requests being counted only once — there’s no functionality to duplicate or split tasks. Reports and average handle time are not accurate because tasks are split across different items. We did look into it; it's worth revisiting. We need willingness from users to log each task, either in one form or by categorising requests so the effort is visible.

From a team's perspective, if there is an option to categorise multiple actions, users could indicate "I’ve received five different requests" and that would show the actual effort. That would help with planning and reporting. We need to encourage that behaviour.

You’ll see requests in your inbox with subjects such as "matter" or "update rate." It will be difficult at first, but people will start to get used to the new process. To stop people submitting trivial one-line tasks, use guidance text on the form: instruct them to segregate requests, add another for multiple items, and include clear guidance in the intro text.

Sandeep — enhancing your processes is primary. What you described feels like a first phase to capture workload and produce MI about innovation and change. After that, we can challenge other processes and use ServiceNow to speed things up and consolidate workflows. Over time, portal usage, development changes and internal processes will demonstrate that we’re managing requests centrally.

I wouldn’t be surprised if not everyone follows the new process immediately. Training and OCM interventions are needed. We should have a communications plan so stakeholders know this is coming. Simon was only seven days in, so we need to keep stakeholders updated. As we start, we should run a set of interventions: explain the approach to self-service, run training, and surface engagement signals. There’s a lot of operational information coming from sessions so far — rate changes, address changes, caching, etc. This week the feedback has come through web chat and we’ve been telling them what is being built.

It won’t be smooth from day one; we’ll be frustrated initially, but in the long term people will fall behind if they don’t adopt the change. Change is hard; everyone likes to continue with existing habits. We should consider workshops for partners and VIPs — they have a particular mindset and will need focused engagement. Partners are under pressure too, and sometimes they simply throw more tasks at us. That’s why self-service is important: we must reduce phone calls and manual work.

Some divisions still handle things manually: ServiceNow may be used for some items, while other tasks are tracked in Excel. We should pilot new processes with partners who are open to digitalisation — they can become champions and give a thumbs up. OPS teams and billing (for example, BES operations and billing) may be more receptive because they can join the dots. Pushback seems more prominent on the UK side.

One quick point: we can’t fully turn off email, and we shouldn’t. We need to ensure that emailed requests are pushed back into the process quickly so people see the response and the benefit of using the portal. Getting junior members to model good behaviour and getting a few champions on board early will help. Demonstrating benefits like reduced chasing time and meeting billing targets (e.g., 80–85%) will encourage adoption.

As we get closer to sending notifications like "ticket closed," we should confirm the wording and what the communications will say so users understand changes. A key readiness question: is the people side signed off? We’ll need to run readiness assessments — have people had enough training, do they see the benefit, and is there any resistance? We should address those issues before go-live with hand-holding and introduce a pilot group. Organise a pilot group to test the process before full rollout — advocates and champions will help.

Leanne, I’ll ask you to push back one meeting. Over the next few weeks, consider dashboards and reports for your area. Think about what reports you want: daily activities, SLA breaches, items that should be on the radar, and urgent issues. Some requirements can be informed by what you need on the dashboard. We can share examples and you can indicate what you want. I’ll send all of that.

Also think about knowledge: what knowledge do customers and employees need, and what existing knowledge should be moved into the new system? That’s something to consider in the next few days and weeks.

The next phase of the project is user stories. There’s a plan to review the user stories and scenarios with SMEs. We discussed functional requirements and sign-off for what we’re planning to build. The next steps are the actions and outputs over the coming weeks — we’ll schedule sessions in the calendar. If you want to join follow-up conversations, let me know.

Design-wise I think we’ve covered everything at a high level. We should agree dates for testing, training and go-live for ongoing service. For the Rama team specifically: consider how they raise ad hoc requests. Some of their requests should go through 3E or ServiceNow, so training and guidance are needed to ensure they do basic checks before raising issues.

We’ll produce a change impacts report that will be accurate at the time of publishing. We’ll send you a draft and iterate it as things from the parking lot come up. There may be quick wins before go-live — for example, publishing the rate card online so people can find it easily. That could be done prior to go-live and will reduce repetitive queries.

Adding half a day initially to testing or training should be fine. Thank you very much for your time — I know everyone’s tired. Are we done for today on the workshop? Thanks to everyone on the call.
