9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/28-3
00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.151
<v Josh Sparkes>talk about what that that future state
looks like.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/29-0
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:49.748
<v Josh Sparkes>We're on Tuesday of our second week.
There's a another workshop going on</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/29-1

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/29-2

<v Josh Sparkes>But today we're all about client fully
focused on you guys.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/29-3
00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.351
<v Josh Sparkes>You guys are the stars, so.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/30-0
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:06.140
<v Josh Sparkes>It was a bit of talking. Yeah,
gender wise. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/30-1
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.351
<v Josh Sparkes>Let me move that thing out the way.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/31-0
00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:15.151
<v Josh Sparkes>Not looking.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/32-0
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:22.033
<v Josh Sparkes>Not working. I'll check it over there. OK.
So we'll we'll try and get you guys out</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/32-1
00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Josh Sparkes>as soon as we can.
I know we've got the whole day and we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/32-2
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.322
<v Josh Sparkes>don't think it'll take the whole day.
You guys have quite a few processes and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/32-3
00:02:29.322 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Josh Sparkes>things that you do,
some of them are quite complex.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/32-4
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.911
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have to talk through those.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/33-0
00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:38.039
<v Josh Sparkes>I think this is a realistic timeline,
so maybe three, half,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/33-1
00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:41.037
<v Josh Sparkes>three will try and get you out of the the
maximum,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/33-2
00:02:41.037 --> 00:02:44.271
<v Josh Sparkes>but we're we're quite a few days in.
So we're in flow.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/33-3
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:47.975
<v Josh Sparkes>So we should be able to to get to our
decisions quite quickly.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/33-4
00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:52.326
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got breaks and lunches built in.
If you guys want to break earlier,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/33-5
00:02:52.326 --> 00:02:53.031
<v Josh Sparkes>let me know.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/34-0
00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:56.335
<v Josh Sparkes>That's fine,
completely flexible quick intros.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/34-1
00:02:56.335 --> 00:03:00.541
<v Josh Sparkes>Then I think it was probably a while back
when we spoke on the phone.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/34-2
00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:04.026
<v Josh Sparkes>If you guys were there when we did the
preliminary calls.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/34-3
00:03:04.026 --> 00:03:08.231
<v Josh Sparkes>So we just do intros again, if that's OK.
I'm Josh Sparks from tqima.</v>

00:05:41.744 --> 00:05:42.911
<v Josh Sparkes>The pain points you have.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/47-0
00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:47.541
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we have a clearview of what the
future state is and what that delta</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/47-1
00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:50.957
<v Josh Sparkes>between current and future.
What do we need to do from a change</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/47-2
00:05:50.957 --> 00:05:53.305
<v Josh Sparkes>perspective,
either through communications,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/47-3
00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:57.521
<v Josh Sparkes>training other broader or wider like
implications like maybe we need to change</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/47-4
00:05:57.521 --> 00:06:01.898
<v Josh Sparkes>roles and responsibilities or consistency
like you're talking about Australia and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/47-5
00:06:01.898 --> 00:06:02.271
<v Josh Sparkes>the UK?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/48-0
00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:06.035
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe there's things that are broader
that will help drive the right behaviours</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/48-1
00:06:06.035 --> 00:06:06.551
<v Josh Sparkes>in adoption.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/49-0
00:06:08.111 --> 00:06:08.231
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/50-0

<v Parik Narain>Morning everyone. I'm Parikh Narayan. I'm.
I'm PQIMA based in London.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/56-0
00:06:41.311 --> 00:06:41.431
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/57-0
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:42.951
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/58-1
00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:46.831
<v Parik Narain>I'm the solutions architect across all
the work streams.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/59-0
00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:52.492
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you Parrot Parrot's a technical
genius. Let's keep moving,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/59-1
00:06:52.492 --> 00:06:56.531
<v Josh Sparkes>so just quite of why we're here today.
It's a bit of a view of the broader</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/59-2
00:06:56.531 --> 00:07:00.731
<v Josh Sparkes>reason we're here. So down the left.
Some of those success outcomes that that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/59-3
00:07:00.731 --> 00:07:04.231
<v Josh Sparkes>we're hoping to get from the programme,
some nice numbers there.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/60-0
00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:07.847
<v Josh Sparkes>And on the right,
we just display in everything fits</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/60-1
00:07:07.847 --> 00:07:11.042
<v Josh Sparkes>together.
So at the top of the kind of queries that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/60-2
00:07:11.042 --> 00:07:15.772
<v Josh Sparkes>employees PS anyone might come to the
come to ask with and they will feed in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/60-3
00:07:15.772 --> 00:07:19.151
<v Josh Sparkes>through the different channels.
They're in the middle.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/61-0
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:24.539
<v Josh Sparkes>We're keeping as part of the programme,
walk up e-mail and telephony available,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/61-1
00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Josh Sparkes>so still be able to contact us by that
route,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/61-2
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.885
<v Josh Sparkes>but we're introducing the employee centre
through the ServiceNow implementation.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/61-3
00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:35.471
<v Josh Sparkes>These other channels that are in black
could be coming later.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/62-0
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:38.914
<v Josh Sparkes>But for right now,
we're looking at employee centre and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/62-1
00:07:38.914 --> 00:07:42.772
<v Josh Sparkes>that's what a lot of the focus will be on.
And then just below that and the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/62-2
00:07:42.772 --> 00:07:45.971
<v Josh Sparkes>functions that this,
this programme is touching and below that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/62-3
00:07:45.971 --> 00:07:49.879
<v Josh Sparkes>is the just some of the technical things.
So we have integrations available.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/62-4
00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:53.991
<v Josh Sparkes>So something to think about what can we
integrate to can make us more effective.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/63-0
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:59.372
<v Josh Sparkes>What the platform can actually do itself,
and all the kind of digital workflows</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/63-1
00:07:59.372 --> 00:08:03.793
<v Josh Sparkes>that the ServiceNow does and we'll be
getting into that when we understand your</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/63-2
00:08:03.793 --> 00:08:08.269
<v Josh Sparkes>processes better at a glance, that's it.
I'm happy to tell you guys do demos and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/63-3
00:08:08.269 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Josh Sparkes>things. If interested as we go through,
if you want to see anything in particular</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/63-4
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.071
<v Josh Sparkes>how you handle tickets.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/64-0
00:08:14.311 --> 00:08:19.022
<v Josh Sparkes>There will be training towards the end of
the programme. We will go into detail,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/64-1
00:08:19.022 --> 00:08:22.919
<v Josh Sparkes>but if you're so inclined as to want to
see what things look like,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/64-2
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:26.060
<v Josh Sparkes>then more than happy to do that,
so quick principles.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/64-3
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.619
<v Josh Sparkes>So as staying present we'll be very
useful.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/64-4
00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:32.632
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll be engaged in conversation that
Deborah's going to be leading.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/64-5
00:08:32.632 --> 00:08:33.911
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think it will be.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/65-0
00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:38.580
<v Josh Sparkes>Natural to be very present on
conversation at a time. As I say,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/65-1
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.547
<v Josh Sparkes>we've got these booming mics,
so it's difficult to speak over each</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/65-2
00:08:42.547 --> 00:08:45.921
<v Josh Sparkes>other anyway. And yeah,
we have brakes already built in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/65-3
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:48.703
<v Josh Sparkes>We have what we call a parking lot over
there.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/65-4
00:08:48.703 --> 00:08:52.551
<v Josh Sparkes>So that just means if we're going down a
rabbit hole that isn't.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/66-0
00:08:52.871 --> 00:08:55.714
<v Josh Sparkes>It's important,
but with something we can't handle right</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/66-1
00:08:55.714 --> 00:08:57.958
<v Josh Sparkes>now,
then we'll take a note put on there and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/66-2
00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.249
<v Josh Sparkes>we come back to it later.
But we just trying to keep ourselves on</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/66-3
00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:05.089
<v Josh Sparkes>the right track. Every voice is valuable.
Yeah, please. I always say please,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/66-4
00:09:05.089 --> 00:09:07.532
<v Josh Sparkes>that the more you guys speak,
the more we learn,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/66-5
00:09:07.532 --> 00:09:11.471
<v Josh Sparkes>the better we can design and build.
So please do feel free to to speak freely.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/67-0
00:09:12.711 --> 00:09:15.384
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
we're going to be trying to push towards</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/67-1
00:09:15.384 --> 00:09:17.943
<v Josh Sparkes>designs and priorities as as soon as we
can.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/67-2
00:09:17.943 --> 00:09:22.321
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can make sorry decisions if we can
make decisions, then let's do that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/67-3
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:26.814
<v Josh Sparkes>If things as, say, needs come back to,
then go in the parking lot and we'll be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/67-4
00:09:26.814 --> 00:09:29.031
<v Josh Sparkes>capturing all actions by various means.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/68-0
00:09:29.351 --> 00:09:32.495
<v Josh Sparkes>Write in we have a transcription.
We have the recording,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/68-1
00:09:32.495 --> 00:09:36.246
<v Josh Sparkes>so don't feel like you need to take notes
on what needs to be done.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/68-2
00:09:36.246 --> 00:09:39.225
<v Josh Sparkes>We take actions and we'll share those
after the call,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/68-3
00:09:39.225 --> 00:09:43.417
<v Josh Sparkes>so we've got everything covered there
from a principles perspective and you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/68-4
00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:45.071
<v Josh Sparkes>guys can focus on what you do.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/69-0
00:09:46.631 --> 00:09:50.688
<v Josh Sparkes>What we've quickly what we've done so far
and what's next and what's today,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/69-1
00:09:50.688 --> 00:09:54.797
<v Josh Sparkes>so that I know there's been work done,
I think you probably spoke to Tim and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/69-2
00:09:54.797 --> 00:09:58.747
<v Josh Sparkes>kind of uncovered what you've done,
what you do process wise in sharewell</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/69-3
00:09:58.747 --> 00:10:03.177
<v Josh Sparkes>today and you guys have fed back on that.
We've been analysing that and that's fed</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/69-4
00:10:03.177 --> 00:10:04.831
<v Josh Sparkes>into our recommendations today.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/70-0
00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:09.940
<v Josh Sparkes>We're going to be looking at what we we
think a service design should be for you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/70-1
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.939
<v Josh Sparkes>guys based on that,
but we do need to clarify parts of of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/70-2
00:10:12.939 --> 00:10:15.939
<v Josh Sparkes>your processes,
which Deborah's going to lead us through.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/70-3
00:10:15.939 --> 00:10:19.610
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's going to be most of the
conversation and part of the output of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/70-4
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:23.230
<v Josh Sparkes>that is requirements gathering.
So just understanding what the system</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/70-5
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.471
<v Josh Sparkes>needs to do essentially.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/72-0
00:10:25.311 --> 00:10:27.909
<v Josh Sparkes>And they all feed into the the final
design,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/72-1
00:10:27.909 --> 00:10:31.546
<v Josh Sparkes>and then at the end of the session,
I'll show you what's next.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/72-2
00:10:31.546 --> 00:10:35.413
<v Josh Sparkes>We go from design and you guys will do.
There's training, testing,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/72-3
00:10:35.413 --> 00:10:39.511
<v Josh Sparkes>go live and a variety of things.
But right now this is the short term.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/74-0
00:10:40.071 --> 00:10:43.575
<v Josh Sparkes>At what we're focused on,
these are all the things may remember</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/74-1
00:10:43.575 --> 00:10:48.008
<v Josh Sparkes>this from the call a couple of weeks back,
all the things we need to do to bring</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/74-2
00:10:48.008 --> 00:10:50.909
<v Josh Sparkes>this to life.
So we I think we touched on the portal</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/74-3
00:10:50.909 --> 00:10:54.522
<v Josh Sparkes>engagement back in the call,
but today we're covering quite a few</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/74-4
00:10:54.522 --> 00:10:55.671
<v Josh Sparkes>things, so we'll say.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/75-0
00:10:56.071 --> 00:11:00.716
<v Josh Sparkes>Services line with clarification.
That's the bulk of this as we go through,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/75-1
00:11:00.716 --> 00:11:03.588
<v Josh Sparkes>there'll be notes of knowledge,
opportunities.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/75-2
00:11:03.588 --> 00:11:07.987
<v Josh Sparkes>Where can we help client customers to
self-serve integrations where the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/75-3
00:11:07.987 --> 00:11:12.631
<v Josh Sparkes>integrations help you guys that will all
come up naturally in conversation?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/76-0
00:11:13.031 --> 00:11:16.402
<v Josh Sparkes>So we cover those reports and dashboards.
If you guys have views on that,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/76-1
00:11:16.402 --> 00:11:18.725
<v Josh Sparkes>then there's something you know you'd
like to see.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/76-2
00:11:18.725 --> 00:11:22.005
<v Josh Sparkes>Please let us know we have some
recommendations at the end for your for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/76-3
00:11:22.005 --> 00:11:24.237
<v Josh Sparkes>your team, which we think might help,
but again,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/76-4
00:11:24.237 --> 00:11:27.471
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll be capturing those requirements and
providing those to you guys.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/77-0
00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:31.520
<v Josh Sparkes>And yeah,
we can touch one Slas as we go through as</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/77-1
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.789
<v Josh Sparkes>well.
So we're covering a big bulk bit of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/77-2
00:11:33.789 --> 00:11:36.814
<v Josh Sparkes>course change on the left where the roof
is addressing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/77-3
00:11:36.814 --> 00:11:41.136
<v Josh Sparkes>So we need to really get out of today
understanding what is reality in terms of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/77-4
00:11:41.136 --> 00:11:44.431
<v Josh Sparkes>processes that you guys do.
So we can build the right thing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/78-0
00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:49.314
<v Josh Sparkes>Knowing pain points and that hopefully
will come up organically.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/78-1
00:11:49.314 --> 00:11:53.699
<v Josh Sparkes>But please as we go through say this,
you know this isn't effective or we don't</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/78-2
00:11:53.699 --> 00:11:57.864
<v Josh Sparkes>like this and that helps us kind of make
sure we address them consolidating</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/78-3
00:11:57.864 --> 00:12:01.208
<v Josh Sparkes>processes and services.
We'll talk through what that is in a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/78-4
00:12:01.208 --> 00:12:01.591
<v Josh Sparkes>moment.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/79-0
00:12:02.311 --> 00:12:04.580
<v Josh Sparkes>And yeah,
caption requirements are kind of that the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/79-1
00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:05.671
<v Josh Sparkes>core part of this really.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/80-0
00:12:07.911 --> 00:12:11.981
<v Josh Sparkes>So what's been done so far?
A lot of process mapping that's fed into</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/80-1
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:15.934
<v Josh Sparkes>this, what we call process decomposition,
the team's kind of work,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/80-2
00:12:15.934 --> 00:12:19.355
<v Josh Sparkes>that's what we've been analysing and
working with so far,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/80-3
00:12:19.355 --> 00:12:23.484
<v Josh Sparkes>and that's feeding into the the service
design that we look at today.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/80-4
00:12:23.484 --> 00:12:26.551
<v Josh Sparkes>And then that'll feed into the user story
creation.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/81-0
00:12:26.991 --> 00:12:30.022
<v Josh Sparkes>If you guys haven't been in software
implementations,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/81-1
00:12:30.022 --> 00:12:34.175
<v Josh Sparkes>that's just basically requirements.
It just describes what how the system</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/81-2
00:12:34.175 --> 00:12:37.149
<v Josh Sparkes>needs to work.
So as a customer I need to be able to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/81-3
00:12:37.149 --> 00:12:41.751
<v Josh Sparkes>request something so that I can get some
outcome. It's a software term, but it's.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/82-0
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:44.910
<v Josh Sparkes>That bottom pie is essentially for us to
cover,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/82-1
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.454
<v Josh Sparkes>but you guys will be able to see what
we're planning on building in design.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/82-2
00:12:48.454 --> 00:12:51.952
<v Josh Sparkes>There will be a a review and sign of of
requirements so you guys will have</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/82-3
00:12:51.952 --> 00:12:53.351
<v Josh Sparkes>transparency as we go through.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/83-0
00:12:55.991 --> 00:13:00.411
<v Josh Sparkes>We we briefly touched on assignment
groups a few weeks ago my so we kind of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/83-1
00:13:00.411 --> 00:13:04.540
<v Josh Sparkes>said there's different roles that you can
have. So user admin manager,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/83-2
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:09.366
<v Josh Sparkes>approver and as we go through the process
these these will come up as to what they</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/83-3
00:13:09.366 --> 00:13:09.831
<v Josh Sparkes>they do.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/84-0
00:13:10.591 --> 00:13:15.322
<v Josh Sparkes>And we've just got there a single client
group that's global guess kind of at a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/84-1
00:13:15.322 --> 00:13:18.160
<v Josh Sparkes>first point conversation.
Does that make sense?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/84-2
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.176
<v Josh Sparkes>If you guys do you have,
do you have an Australia,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/84-3
00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:25.078
<v Josh Sparkes>you're an Australia area, OK.
And I think as we maybe go through,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/84-4
00:13:25.078 --> 00:13:27.680
<v Josh Sparkes>Deborah,
we we go through the processes and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/84-5
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.631
<v Josh Sparkes>capture can things be globalised.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/85-0
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:35.768
<v Josh Sparkes>Two things need to be separated.
Maybe some things are globalised and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/85-1
00:13:35.768 --> 00:13:42.690
<v Josh Sparkes>everyone can see all the requests or
cases. Majority of our workload is global,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/85-2
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.631
<v Josh Sparkes>one which is a system restriction.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/86-0
00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:51.417
<v Josh Sparkes>That we're working on another project at
the same time as this,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/86-1
00:13:51.417 --> 00:13:54.051
<v Josh Sparkes>hopefully coming to fruition at the same
time,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/86-2
00:13:54.051 --> 00:13:57.076
<v Josh Sparkes>which would then result in it being a
global process.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/86-3
00:13:57.076 --> 00:14:01.446
<v Josh Sparkes>So there is only one for that impact.
Yeah is is she a well system resolution</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/86-4
00:14:01.446 --> 00:14:03.351
<v Josh Sparkes>or interaction? No, it's not true.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/87-0
00:14:04.231 --> 00:14:07.684
<v Josh Sparkes>Interaction and ticket.
It's the ticket part, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/87-1
00:14:07.684 --> 00:14:12.065
<v Josh Sparkes>International ticket. Yeah.
Last action and ticket is the current</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/87-2
00:14:12.065 --> 00:14:17.244
<v Josh Sparkes>systems that we use for distributions.
But there's a a project ongoing at the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/87-3
00:14:17.244 --> 00:14:20.231
<v Josh Sparkes>moment to bring in another platform. Oh,
OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/88-0
00:14:21.271 --> 00:14:23.916
<v Josh Sparkes>And to be fair,
it's more of the distribution side</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/88-1
00:14:23.916 --> 00:14:27.805
<v Josh Sparkes>because the interaction thing say that
it's not going to change right now.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/88-2
00:14:27.805 --> 00:14:31.953
<v Josh Sparkes>It's more of it clearing up that data,
but the future platform allows us to use</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/88-3
00:14:31.953 --> 00:14:35.842
<v Josh Sparkes>the two different interaction instances,
which will make it and what's the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/88-4
00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:36.671
<v Josh Sparkes>platform called.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/89-0
00:14:37.471 --> 00:14:44.681
<v Josh Sparkes>You're bringing in. Yeah. Future, future.
Future. Future, future. OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/89-1
00:14:44.681 --> 00:14:49.831
<v Josh Sparkes>Get any idea on a timeline as to sorry.
Let's go.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/90-0
00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:58.591
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh yeah, she's she's she's also the PO.
And the I've just.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/91-0
00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:08.571
<v Josh Sparkes>Any idea on the timeline?
Has anyone mentioned the last timeline</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/91-1
00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:12.683
<v Josh Sparkes>was July OK,
but it's not been quick because of the IT</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/91-2
00:15:12.683 --> 00:15:17.991
<v Josh Sparkes>so it keeps getting pushed back so some
security restrictions on that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/92-0
00:15:20.111 --> 00:15:26.054
<v Josh Sparkes>A hard go live is is around September 1st
so we need to to make sure we line line</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/92-1
00:15:26.054 --> 00:15:31.852
<v Josh Sparkes>those UPS if that's going to be live on
time then we'll be planning to that for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/92-2
00:15:31.852 --> 00:15:32.431
<v Josh Sparkes>example.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/93-0
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:37.265
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
good to know that that's we've had even</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/93-1
00:15:37.265 --> 00:15:43.587
<v Josh Sparkes>though we are not using the same system,
we have this ability to all the all the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/93-2
00:15:43.587 --> 00:15:49.128
<v Josh Sparkes>cases in shareware from both sides. OK,
right. All right. Perfect. Oh,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/93-3
00:15:49.128 --> 00:15:51.391
<v Josh Sparkes>in shareware it is right. OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/94-0
00:15:53.271 --> 00:15:56.892
<v Josh Sparkes>Take those cases up,
but then we still have the visibility.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/94-1
00:15:56.892 --> 00:16:01.419
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the key thing for us, Josh,
is to escalate where there might be an</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/94-2
00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:05.281
<v Josh Sparkes>overlap. So if we take that,
we just have to comment via chart,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/94-3
00:16:05.281 --> 00:16:10.109
<v Josh Sparkes>we absolutely need to make sure that not
two projects are solution for the same</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/94-4
00:16:10.109 --> 00:16:10.471
<v Josh Sparkes>thing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/95-0
00:16:11.231 --> 00:16:14.085
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
the projects initiation documents to come</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/95-1
00:16:14.085 --> 00:16:16.582
<v Josh Sparkes>out,
I've just not seen it yet for in the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/95-2
00:16:16.582 --> 00:16:19.435
<v Josh Sparkes>future.
So it's one of my things to flag on the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/95-3
00:16:19.435 --> 00:16:23.834
<v Josh Sparkes>and it's already been raised with
Glendale to be clear that we're on this</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/95-4
00:16:23.834 --> 00:16:28.411
<v Josh Sparkes>project and it's running in conjunction,
if you if you could keep Jill and I</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/95-5
00:16:28.411 --> 00:16:30.551
<v Josh Sparkes>really running in parallel with you.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/96-0
00:16:30.671 --> 00:16:33.613
<v Josh Sparkes>That hopefully make sure that
everything's joined up,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/96-1
00:16:33.613 --> 00:16:37.154
<v Josh Sparkes>because we've also got the events stuff
that process efficiency.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/96-2
00:16:37.154 --> 00:16:40.314
<v Josh Sparkes>So John's working on as well.
So it ties into the events,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/96-3
00:16:40.314 --> 00:16:43.692
<v Josh Sparkes>which also ties in.
So there's a bit of overlap on that well,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/96-4
00:16:43.692 --> 00:16:46.743
<v Josh Sparkes>there's loads. I mean,
we've spent quite a lot of these</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/96-5
00:16:46.743 --> 00:16:48.431
<v Josh Sparkes>workshops on Venn diagrams for.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/97-0
00:16:48.831 --> 00:16:52.967
<v Josh Sparkes>Where everything overlaps but a key.
A key thing is it remains connected after</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/97-1
00:16:52.967 --> 00:16:56.265
<v Josh Sparkes>this. Yeah, you know,
so that nobody gets any surprises. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/97-2
00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:59.982
<v Josh Sparkes>as we go through the services,
you'll probably highlight actually this</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/97-3
00:16:59.982 --> 00:17:02.442
<v Josh Sparkes>does it over here as well as service you
know.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/97-4
00:17:02.442 --> 00:17:04.431
<v Josh Sparkes>So hopefully that will fall out today.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/98-0
00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:09.874
<v Josh Sparkes>You can see that overlap all right.
Very useful. Thank you very much some.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/98-1
00:17:09.874 --> 00:17:13.155
<v Josh Sparkes>I think when we spoke last,
we did a pain point exercise.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/98-2
00:17:13.155 --> 00:17:16.776
<v Josh Sparkes>We captured those. There's a lot,
there's a lot more than this,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/98-3
00:17:16.776 --> 00:17:20.566
<v Josh Sparkes>but we we just keep these in mind as we
go through. And as I said,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/98-4
00:17:20.566 --> 00:17:25.149
<v Josh Sparkes>they might come up during session and we
just keep these in mind that we'll feed</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/98-5
00:17:25.149 --> 00:17:25.431
<v Josh Sparkes>into.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/99-0
00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:29.981
<v Josh Sparkes>Flag requirements that we build because
we're trying to address these essentially</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/99-1
00:17:29.981 --> 00:17:34.014
<v Josh Sparkes>nothing to drill into there though.
So what we're going to do today is we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/99-2
00:17:34.014 --> 00:17:36.958
<v Josh Sparkes>call a consolidation and service design.
So, Deborah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/99-3
00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:40.991
<v Josh Sparkes>do you want to explain some of the points
that are pertinent for the day?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/100-0
00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:44.371
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. As we go through our process,
it will be how did you,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/100-1
00:17:44.371 --> 00:17:47.890
<v Josh Sparkes>how did it land with you?
What's the trigger? What data do you need?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/100-2
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.000
<v Josh Sparkes>What data could you have got?
That is what you actually get,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/100-3
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.284
<v Josh Sparkes>we improve that data that performance you
know from the requester, what's the Slas,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/100-4
00:17:55.284 --> 00:17:56.711
<v Josh Sparkes>lots of storytelling really.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/101-0
00:17:57.071 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's just going through,
we won't go through line by line every</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/101-1
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.658
<v Josh Sparkes>process.
It's really sort of bringing it up to a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/101-2
00:18:03.658 --> 00:18:08.049
<v Josh Sparkes>service level and in the back of our
minds sort of enriching that data first.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/101-3
00:18:08.049 --> 00:18:11.202
<v Josh Sparkes>Basically first time, right?
So it lands with yourself.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/101-4
00:18:11.202 --> 00:18:13.791
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can just work on it and meet that
SLA.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/102-0
00:18:14.631 --> 00:18:18.212
<v Josh Sparkes>And we've seen works well in all the
other workshops,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/102-1
00:18:18.212 --> 00:18:23.118
<v Josh Sparkes>just sort of all those conversational
pieces and scenarios that you have.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/102-2
00:18:23.118 --> 00:18:26.234
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
there's never a happy path probably,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/102-3
00:18:26.234 --> 00:18:30.743
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, sort of one person, one slide,
four weeks time, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/102-4
00:18:30.743 --> 00:18:33.991
<v Josh Sparkes>rather than lots of slides all at the
same time.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/103-0
00:18:34.151 --> 00:18:38.230
<v Josh Sparkes>Required yesterday, you know,
so all those pain points and everything</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/103-1
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.794
<v Josh Sparkes>you have to do,
but we'll discuss all that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/103-2
00:18:40.794 --> 00:18:45.397
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a a service level to work through
it and we've broken it down into that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/103-3
00:18:45.397 --> 00:18:49.826
<v Josh Sparkes>sort of pre bids or bids all the way
through to invent event management and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/103-4
00:18:49.826 --> 00:18:53.671
<v Josh Sparkes>then the output of that.
So there was lots of things that we saw.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/104-0
00:18:54.311 --> 00:18:59.688
<v Josh Sparkes>That fall under your remit? I try. And so.
But then just for discussion points,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/104-1
00:18:59.688 --> 00:19:02.982
<v Josh Sparkes>you know who requested it?
Who could request it?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/104-2
00:19:02.982 --> 00:19:07.015
<v Josh Sparkes>You shouldn't request it.
And how you update the requester,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/104-3
00:19:07.015 --> 00:19:10.711
<v Josh Sparkes>for example,
or on behalf of those types of scenarios.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/105-0
00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:15.873
<v Josh Sparkes>On the right hand side, again,
these are just sort of discussion points.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/105-1
00:19:15.873 --> 00:19:18.891
<v Josh Sparkes>We won't go through one by one process by
process,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/105-2
00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:23.508
<v Josh Sparkes>but they're all the things that we're
thinking about as you move towards sort</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/105-3
00:19:23.508 --> 00:19:26.231
<v Josh Sparkes>of a scalable model that's with this
service.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/106-0
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:31.581
<v Josh Sparkes>Could it be if we get lots of requests or
someone else come on board from a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/106-1
00:19:31.581 --> 00:19:36.526
<v Josh Sparkes>different location? For example,
it's easy to scale up without impacting</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/106-2
00:19:36.526 --> 00:19:41.608
<v Josh Sparkes>your service dramatically. And again,
roles and responsibilities you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/106-3
00:19:41.608 --> 00:19:43.911
<v Josh Sparkes>does it land as a global group or?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/107-0
00:19:44.831 --> 00:19:49.981
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you have a skills matrix that maybe
you work on particular clients amongst</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/107-1
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:54.141
<v Josh Sparkes>amongst you as a as a service,
or Australia only handle these?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/107-2
00:19:54.141 --> 00:19:57.045
<v Josh Sparkes>They don't do this type of thing,
you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/107-3
00:19:57.045 --> 00:20:02.591
<v Josh Sparkes>we just grow those stories and discuss it
really as we go through each one of them.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/108-0
00:20:03.711 --> 00:20:06.384
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
we we keep conversational and we'll be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/108-1
00:20:06.384 --> 00:20:10.363
<v Josh Sparkes>guiding you you through.
But these are the the points we touch on.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/108-2
00:20:10.363 --> 00:20:14.342
<v Josh Sparkes>I mentioned consolidation earlier.
So you guys do a lot of things.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/108-3
00:20:14.342 --> 00:20:17.311
<v Josh Sparkes>We capture 41 processes there.
There may be more.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/109-0
00:20:18.071 --> 00:20:22.407
<v Josh Sparkes>We try to consolidate them into core
services that are recognisable by one of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/109-1
00:20:22.407 --> 00:20:26.798
<v Josh Sparkes>the organisation and that's what you
it'll make more sense when we look at the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/109-2
00:20:26.798 --> 00:20:30.911
<v Josh Sparkes>the sheet and you're able to see
groupings of things we do into services.</v>

00:20:32.551 --> 00:20:35.516
<v Josh Sparkes>Some probably pertinent FAQs on the right
there.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/111-1
00:20:35.516 --> 00:20:40.296
<v Josh Sparkes>So are we losing any functionality by
consolidating to which the answer is no,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/111-2
00:20:40.296 --> 00:20:43.745
<v Josh Sparkes>all capabilities remain just organised
more efficiently,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/111-3
00:20:43.745 --> 00:20:46.951
<v Josh Sparkes>so there's lots of benefits from from
this approach.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/112-0
00:20:48.151 --> 00:20:51.432
<v Josh Sparkes>And this is that's a typical way of going
about it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/112-1
00:20:51.432 --> 00:20:55.597
<v Josh Sparkes>So it will all make a lot more sense when
we when we get into it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/112-2
00:20:55.597 --> 00:20:58.878
<v Josh Sparkes>Here's just an example view of of what it
could be.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/112-3
00:20:58.878 --> 00:21:03.673
<v Josh Sparkes>So some of the processes you might
recognise from below feed into different</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/112-4
00:21:03.673 --> 00:21:07.711
<v Josh Sparkes>kind of consolidated services at the top
and we're just making.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/113-0
00:21:07.831 --> 00:21:11.259
<v Josh Sparkes>Recognisable things that people may
understand a bit better,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/113-1
00:21:11.259 --> 00:21:14.686
<v Josh Sparkes>let's say that will will become more
clear as we go through.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/113-2
00:21:14.686 --> 00:21:18.338
<v Josh Sparkes>This is more our process, not for you.
We'll be going through it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/113-3
00:21:18.338 --> 00:21:21.709
<v Josh Sparkes>conversationally.
It's just a consulting process internally</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/113-4
00:21:21.709 --> 00:21:24.911
<v Josh Sparkes>that we'll go through to to get to the
outcomes we need.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/114-0
00:21:25.311 --> 00:21:28.970
<v Josh Sparkes>So no need to deep dive in,
just wanted to display the the high level</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/114-1
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.323
<v Josh Sparkes>process we go through.
That's it for intros.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/114-2
00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:34.250
<v Josh Sparkes>The the value of the session comes in the
conversation,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/114-3
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:37.595
<v Josh Sparkes>so that's what we're going to.
We're going to get into Deborah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/114-4
00:21:37.595 --> 00:21:39.111
<v Josh Sparkes>if you'd like to kick us off.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/115-0
00:21:41.191 --> 00:21:44.904
<v Josh Sparkes>And it worked very well all last week and
this week,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/115-1
00:21:44.904 --> 00:21:49.177
<v Josh Sparkes>sort of a for yourself to give a high
level view. I sort of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/115-2
00:21:49.177 --> 00:21:52.539
<v Josh Sparkes>I didn't want to trivialise, you know,
clients,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/115-3
00:21:52.539 --> 00:21:56.391
<v Josh Sparkes>I sort of summarised it in that probably
the function.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/116-0
00:21:57.511 --> 00:22:00.578
<v Josh Sparkes>In my mind was to sort of support and win
work,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/116-1
00:22:00.578 --> 00:22:05.434
<v Josh Sparkes>and you know all that end to end
processes, you know reputation and output,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/116-2
00:22:05.434 --> 00:22:09.203
<v Josh Sparkes>event management, the PR side of it,
the award side of it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/116-3
00:22:09.203 --> 00:22:11.311
<v Josh Sparkes>But essentially that helping the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/117-0
00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:17.719
<v Josh Sparkes>Firm and the clients when that works.
So sort of started.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/117-1
00:22:17.719 --> 00:22:25.013
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know if it's maybe you could then
add additional overlay to that if you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/117-2
00:22:25.013 --> 00:22:28.751
<v Josh Sparkes>don't mind, just as an introduction from.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/118-0
00:22:30.671 --> 00:22:35.333
<v Josh Sparkes>As my perspective,
we are the primary support function for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/118-1
00:22:35.333 --> 00:22:40.152
<v Josh Sparkes>business development and brand marketing
and communications,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/118-2
00:22:40.152 --> 00:22:43.865
<v Josh Sparkes>which does touch on quiet life cycle,
support,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/118-3
00:22:43.865 --> 00:22:46.551
<v Josh Sparkes>marketing and engagement and then.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/119-0
00:22:47.111 --> 00:22:52.423
<v Josh Sparkes>I think aspect for us is the centralised
directory organisation,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/119-1
00:22:52.423 --> 00:22:57.981
<v Josh Sparkes>so I'd say that's the key.
The areas which encompasses the two main</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/119-2
00:22:57.981 --> 00:23:03.620
<v Josh Sparkes>divisions being BBBMC and obd,
known as CMG. Just to confuse things.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/119-3
00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.071
<v Josh Sparkes>So clients markets and growth.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/120-0
00:23:06.751 --> 00:23:12.900
<v Josh Sparkes>Internally, so externally as good as BD.
Internally it's CNG which is quite smart</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/120-1
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:18.223
<v Josh Sparkes>as we go, which is the BD function. OK.
And then additionally to that,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/120-2
00:23:18.223 --> 00:23:23.472
<v Josh Sparkes>we have the research teams,
the business intelligence team that we do</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/120-3
00:23:23.472 --> 00:23:24.671
<v Josh Sparkes>support as well.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/121-0
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:28.851
<v Josh Sparkes>But that's just a small portion of what
we do,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/121-1
00:23:28.851 --> 00:23:32.753
<v Josh Sparkes>but it does fall into the client and
safely support.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/121-2
00:23:32.753 --> 00:23:37.097
<v Josh Sparkes>What do you support the BI teams do?
We can it's research,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/121-3
00:23:37.097 --> 00:23:40.999
<v Josh Sparkes>so look at the profiles. So it's not like,
you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/121-4
00:23:40.999 --> 00:23:44.311
<v Josh Sparkes>you're reporting it's business
intelligence.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/122-0
00:23:45.431 --> 00:23:52.283
<v Josh Sparkes>For the the gates towards, yeah,
business intelligence or not,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/122-1
00:23:52.283 --> 00:23:59.351
<v Josh Sparkes>business intelligence and research.
And the informed thing, the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/123-0
00:24:00.311 --> 00:24:10.388
<v Josh Sparkes>Events the the patching or it can be both.
Yeah. Sometimes for something.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/123-1
00:24:10.388 --> 00:24:19.511
<v Josh Sparkes>If they are looking at like engaging the
new clients or something.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/124-0
00:24:20.071 --> 00:24:23.350
<v Josh Sparkes>This for to a new client to win to win
work.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/124-1
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:29.178
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes they will approach us or via
you to say can you check if we have done</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/124-2
00:24:29.178 --> 00:24:33.258
<v Josh Sparkes>anything for this clients or can you like
take out any.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/124-3
00:24:33.258 --> 00:24:39.231
<v Josh Sparkes>Anyone in Ashes has any relationship with
these key people in the in the company.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/125-0
00:24:39.711 --> 00:24:46.751
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's things like this or sometimes
they will ask us to run the research on</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/125-1
00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:53.703
<v Josh Sparkes>any any seminars or exhibitions that the
the the BD group can like register or</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/125-2
00:24:53.703 --> 00:24:58.631

new people to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/126-0
00:25:00.151 --> 00:25:04.074
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
some of the this is some of the some of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/126-1
00:25:04.074 --> 00:25:10.385
<v Josh Sparkes>the things that we help. Yeah. Yeah.
But yeah, you business intelligence,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/126-2
00:25:10.385 --> 00:25:12.431
<v Josh Sparkes>they're not technically.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/127-0
00:25:16.391 --> 00:25:19.341
<v Josh Sparkes>Too many acronyms,
but it's business intelligence is the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/127-1
00:25:19.341 --> 00:25:23.532
<v Josh Sparkes>name of the team. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You.
When we say that this just goes off the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/127-2
00:25:23.532 --> 00:25:26.067
<v Josh Sparkes>tongue,
it's business intelligent unit for us is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/127-3
00:25:26.067 --> 00:25:26.791
<v Josh Sparkes>for otherwise.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/128-0
00:25:33.671 --> 00:25:33.791
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/129-0
00:25:35.591 --> 00:25:39.238
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so is a good place to start the bids and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/129-1
00:25:39.238 --> 00:25:41.911
<v Josh Sparkes>pitch support. Is that a natural?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/130-0
00:25:43.311 --> 00:25:46.456
<v Josh Sparkes>Landing point. Yeah,
we can start to do that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/130-1
00:25:46.456 --> 00:25:51.651
<v Josh Sparkes>So maybe we can discuss like a trailer
today how that lands with you or you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/130-2
00:25:51.651 --> 00:25:57.256
<v Josh Sparkes>somebody who contacts you in order to do
that initial support or is there another</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/130-3
00:25:57.256 --> 00:26:01.631
<v Josh Sparkes>trigger upstream that you know it's
coming, you can start that?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/131-0
00:26:02.111 --> 00:26:05.005
<v Josh Sparkes>Pre work before the official request
lands.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/131-1
00:26:05.005 --> 00:26:10.465
<v Josh Sparkes>It would be interesting to know that sort
of life life cycle and how it comes into</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/131-2
00:26:10.465 --> 00:26:14.740
<v Josh Sparkes>on a day-to-day basis.
So this is one of our ones that we get as</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/131-3
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.936
<v Josh Sparkes>I needed it yesterday right as always
yeah yeah because it's generally like we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/131-4
00:26:19.936 --> 00:26:20.791
<v Josh Sparkes>first market.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/132-0
00:26:21.591 --> 00:26:26.615
<v Josh Sparkes>Have the best pitch,
several aspects in the way that we can</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/132-1
00:26:26.615 --> 00:26:30.969
<v Josh Sparkes>support and that can be through internal
reporting.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/132-2
00:26:30.969 --> 00:26:37.751
<v Josh Sparkes>So using systems like 3E Chorus global
credential solution to then build a pack.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/133-0
00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:42.635
<v Josh Sparkes>Or a capability statement for the
partners to review. OK,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/133-1
00:26:42.635 --> 00:26:46.274
<v Josh Sparkes>so the the artefact is a capability
statement, is that right?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/133-2
00:26:46.274 --> 00:26:50.030
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what you're producing.
So it comes in when you say they.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/133-3
00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:54.431
<v Josh Sparkes>So does it come into show or e-mail today
that says we need the following?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/134-0
00:26:55.031 --> 00:26:59.722
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe a one liner?
Of course I would say e-mail and through</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/134-1
00:26:59.722 --> 00:27:04.179
<v Josh Sparkes>our form as well.
So those that use our form will put it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/134-2
00:27:04.179 --> 00:27:08.791
<v Josh Sparkes>through the forms like that category,
others it will be a.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/135-0
00:27:09.911 --> 00:27:12.760
<v Josh Sparkes>A roundabout.
They are asking for a capability</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/135-1
00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.307
<v Josh Sparkes>statement in an e-mail without saying the
words sure, and the form I mean,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/135-2
00:27:17.307 --> 00:27:21.732
<v Josh Sparkes>that'd be good to see. I mean,
that has all your official checklist what</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/135-3
00:27:21.732 --> 00:27:26.581
<v Josh Sparkes>you need. Use it for when do you want it?
We've got probably 3 roots and tasks.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/135-4
00:27:26.581 --> 00:27:29.551
<v Josh Sparkes>Fine.
So we've got our form being the operation.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/136-0
00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:35.572
<v Josh Sparkes>Forum for things like capability
statements, yeah, capability statements.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/136-1
00:27:35.572 --> 00:27:40.806
<v Josh Sparkes>We've also bought it and more generally,
so it's high level forms.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/136-2
00:27:40.806 --> 00:27:44.711
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's like required by the police
confirmation.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/137-0
00:27:47.311 --> 00:27:50.298
<v Josh Sparkes>And what does that basic?
What do you need for that basic</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/137-1
00:27:50.298 --> 00:27:53.080
<v Josh Sparkes>information?
Add in the most simplest form that gives</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/137-2
00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:57.148
<v Josh Sparkes>us the information we need to start the
work without the back and forth at the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/137-3
00:27:57.148 --> 00:27:59.311
<v Josh Sparkes>start so Mandy can show you that and then.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/138-0
00:28:00.911 --> 00:28:05.161
<v Josh Sparkes>The other we put in is our global content
calendar, which links to publications,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/138-1
00:28:05.161 --> 00:28:08.204
<v Josh Sparkes>which I think we'll touch on when we get
to that process.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/138-2
00:28:08.204 --> 00:28:12.244
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's a form basically that feeds into
share. Well, what's your children?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/138-3
00:28:12.244 --> 00:28:14.919
<v Josh Sparkes>What's that one?
That phone holds all that content</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/138-4
00:28:14.919 --> 00:28:15.391
<v Josh Sparkes>calendar.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/139-0
00:28:16.111 --> 00:28:21.110
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, GCC other reference,
because you'll hear us roll that off the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/139-1
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:25.956
<v Josh Sparkes>tongue too. So the acronym which, yeah,
by the ends of the day.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/139-2
00:28:25.956 --> 00:28:32.166
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the events form is the other one
in similar to how the GCC works and the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/139-3
00:28:32.166 --> 00:28:35.271
<v Josh Sparkes>operational form is that it's a text box.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/140-0
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:41.143
<v Josh Sparkes>A selection of all things need as part of
an event that then feeds them to share</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/140-1
00:28:41.143 --> 00:28:46.032
<v Josh Sparkes>well, gives us all the tickets. OK,
so that we thought there was an event</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/140-2
00:28:46.032 --> 00:28:49.534
<v Josh Sparkes>management side of it.
So to handle that separately.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/140-3
00:28:49.534 --> 00:28:54.951
<v Josh Sparkes>So it would be the sort of the capability
statements. So that's the artefact out.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/141-0
00:28:55.471 --> 00:29:00.825
<v Josh Sparkes>The capability statement is that always
occasional with the additional things</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/141-1
00:29:00.825 --> 00:29:06.385
<v Josh Sparkes>that they also require or I wouldn't say
so genuinely when the aspect capability</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/141-2
00:29:06.385 --> 00:29:09.679
<v Josh Sparkes>and that's what that's what they're yeah.
Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/141-3
00:29:09.679 --> 00:29:13.591
<v Josh Sparkes>Those other two we don't support on
anymore the way the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/142-0
00:29:15.151 --> 00:29:20.656
<v Josh Sparkes>Q&amp;A peer yeah, the Q&amp;A peers.
You know, some of them will be drainable,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/142-1
00:29:20.656 --> 00:29:23.890
<v Josh Sparkes>right.
That's another question credential that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/142-2
00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:27.743
<v Josh Sparkes>doesn't happen.
So is it because it's absorbed by other</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/142-3
00:29:27.743 --> 00:29:30.151
<v Josh Sparkes>processes or you do it in a second?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/143-0
00:29:30.951 --> 00:29:36.315
<v Josh Sparkes>Does it now capture in as part of the
credential capturing Project,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/143-1
00:29:36.315 --> 00:29:42.231
<v Josh Sparkes>Cross checking whether that matter is
that see that tab on the own course.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/144-0
00:29:43.911 --> 00:29:48.593
<v Josh Sparkes>What was Chorus doing? What was that?
Which one? Sorry, the chorus ones.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/144-1
00:29:48.593 --> 00:29:52.634
<v Josh Sparkes>What was that? The two processes there.
The two at the bottom.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/144-2
00:29:52.634 --> 00:29:56.097
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's the Q&amp;A content.
We don't review that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/144-3
00:29:56.097 --> 00:30:00.394
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the suggested there's unlikely
to look at that map again,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/144-4
00:30:00.394 --> 00:30:02.831
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's not something we've done. OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/145-0
00:30:04.231 --> 00:30:06.779
<v Josh Sparkes>It's absorbed by other projects. Yeah,
it's.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/145-1
00:30:06.779 --> 00:30:10.743
<v Josh Sparkes>It's absolved by investment was changed.
We got graded this estimate,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/145-2
00:30:10.743 --> 00:30:12.271
<v Josh Sparkes>which is the need for that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/146-0
00:30:15.191 --> 00:30:17.530
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so the first one is it said comes in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/146-1
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.953
<v Josh Sparkes>shower or e-mail and the intention is to
keep this service.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/146-2
00:30:20.953 --> 00:30:25.688
<v Josh Sparkes>Now you get the form that they can go in
and and populate that all the information</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/146-3
00:30:25.688 --> 00:30:29.111
<v Josh Sparkes>that you need in order to start rather
than back and forth.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/146-4
00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:32.191
<v Josh Sparkes>But if you could share that form that
would be great.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/149-0
00:30:36.071 --> 00:30:40.722
<v Josh Sparkes>It is already in share mail, isn't it?
The forms for these ones that one that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/149-1
00:30:40.722 --> 00:30:45.135
<v Josh Sparkes>one has the operational one? Yeah, one.
OK, the Gmails, you get that. OK,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/149-2
00:30:45.135 --> 00:30:49.309
<v Josh Sparkes>but once you get active share mail as
well, you'll be able to see it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/149-3
00:30:49.309 --> 00:30:52.111
<v Josh Sparkes>The hybrid mail done.
The demo she showed you.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/151-0
00:30:52.391 --> 00:30:58.184
<v Josh Sparkes>The SharePoint points that yeah,
that's how it works. So the key things,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/151-1
00:30:58.184 --> 00:31:02.311
<v Josh Sparkes>it's like, who's the owner,
the category selection,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/151-2
00:31:02.311 --> 00:31:08.342
<v Josh Sparkes>whether they require a we can call for
capability statement when there is a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/151-3
00:31:08.342 --> 00:31:12.071
<v Josh Sparkes>quick turn around,
they want to give you more.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/152-0
00:31:12.151 --> 00:31:16.566
<v Josh Sparkes>Information as opposed to what you can
write in a form or in an e-mail just</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/152-1
00:31:16.566 --> 00:31:21.214
<v Josh Sparkes>around how it's placed on a PowerPoint.
There's some people who want to discuss</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/152-2
00:31:21.214 --> 00:31:25.571
<v Josh Sparkes>that about the best way to present it
when it's required by the time zone.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/152-3
00:31:25.571 --> 00:31:29.114
<v Josh Sparkes>It's specified for.
So between Glasgow and Brisbane and then</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/152-4
00:31:29.114 --> 00:31:31.031
<v Josh Sparkes>time, then it's required as well.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/153-0
00:31:33.471 --> 00:31:39.041
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, windows. Is that your SLA?
For those we have SLA no assessments.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/153-1
00:31:39.041 --> 00:31:43.591
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's cavy that as is we have them,
but they're very.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/154-0
00:31:44.751 --> 00:31:49.309
<v Josh Sparkes>What's as in?
Everything's either same day or next day</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/154-1
00:31:49.309 --> 00:31:55.191
<v Josh Sparkes>and you will get the odd one,
like by relationship reporting and yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/154-2
00:31:55.191 --> 00:32:01.903
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, I research it will have longer Slas,
but the rest is pretty much same day.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/154-3
00:32:01.903 --> 00:32:04.471
<v Josh Sparkes>Next day are those agreed with.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/155-0
00:32:04.551 --> 00:32:09.737
<v Josh Sparkes>For the business or is that something you
guys have just put in there from an SLA</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/155-1
00:32:09.737 --> 00:32:12.899
<v Josh Sparkes>perspective?
The SLA is from what we spoke with D</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/155-2
00:32:12.899 --> 00:32:16.568
<v Josh Sparkes>about with operation.
They're looking to try and improve.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/155-3
00:32:16.568 --> 00:32:18.591
<v Josh Sparkes>So they don't want them visible.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/156-0
00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:23.898
<v Josh Sparkes>For the business to see them. Yeah.
Is that SL ES will be a wider</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/156-1
00:32:23.898 --> 00:32:28.184
<v Josh Sparkes>conversation that we do from an ask
perspective and what we're planning to do</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/156-2
00:32:28.184 --> 00:32:32.305
<v Josh Sparkes>is to start looking at Ole level,
which is the label that sits on the task</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/156-3
00:32:32.305 --> 00:32:35.272
<v Josh Sparkes>that you're completing.
So put time against the task,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/156-4
00:32:35.272 --> 00:32:36.151
<v Josh Sparkes>which will then.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/157-0
00:32:36.711 --> 00:32:40.242
<v Josh Sparkes>Calculate what the SLA should be,
and that's where we'll probably start</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/157-1
00:32:40.242 --> 00:32:42.351
<v Josh Sparkes>from,
so we've not agreed if SL as will be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/157-2
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:45.097
<v Josh Sparkes>shared with business and stuff like that
at the moment,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/157-3
00:32:45.097 --> 00:32:48.824
<v Josh Sparkes>that is what we will progress to,
but maybe not necessarily in day one yet.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/157-4
00:32:48.824 --> 00:32:52.551
<v Josh Sparkes>What we will can I start to back on SL as
and do an exercise the right one.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/158-0
00:32:53.231 --> 00:32:56.598
<v Josh Sparkes>The cars are there to see.
They're just as a standard,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/158-1
00:32:56.598 --> 00:32:59.720
<v Josh Sparkes>so they are visible when they select the
category.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/158-2
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.087
<v Josh Sparkes>How long it takes for that particular
task as a guide.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/158-3
00:33:03.087 --> 00:33:07.740
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's always caveatted with the if
they do need that extra support for a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/158-4
00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.351
<v Josh Sparkes>proper turn around, then to contact the E,
Mandy, Claudia.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/159-0
00:33:12.271 --> 00:33:17.008
<v Josh Sparkes>To arrange for things prioritise the most
things coming up that is urgent,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/159-1
00:33:17.008 --> 00:33:21.871
<v Josh Sparkes>like genuinely urgent, yes. And the union?
What do you mean by the business?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/160-0
00:33:28.511 --> 00:33:34.560
<v Josh Sparkes>3 hours. So my question was if you were,
let's say I came to the business,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/160-1
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:40.769
<v Josh Sparkes>you have a three hour turn around,
let's say that's your for example and the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/160-2
00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:43.591
<v Josh Sparkes>business came to you and said well.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/161-0
00:33:43.991 --> 00:33:47.847
<v Josh Sparkes>I need it end of day and it's do you
still provide that three hour turn around</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/161-1
00:33:47.847 --> 00:33:51.799
<v Josh Sparkes>despite the fact that obviously you would
probably want to do it in the morning,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/161-2
00:33:51.799 --> 00:33:55.703
<v Josh Sparkes>but they came to you in the afternoon.
Do you still meet that three hour SLA as</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/161-3
00:33:55.703 --> 00:33:59.559
<v Josh Sparkes>just an example this is or do you just
force yourselves to meet whatever their</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/161-4
00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:01.071
<v Josh Sparkes>timelines are? So we're trying.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/162-0
00:34:01.631 --> 00:34:05.812
<v Josh Sparkes>Accommodate where possible to deliver
within the timelines that they're</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/162-1
00:34:05.812 --> 00:34:09.993
<v Josh Sparkes>providing. If it's achievable.
So it's based on the current capacity of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/162-2
00:34:09.993 --> 00:34:14.755
<v Josh Sparkes>the team, what they're already working on,
what can be moved around to prioritise</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/162-3
00:34:14.755 --> 00:34:18.471
<v Josh Sparkes>that piece of work in order for it to be
facilitated. And then.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/163-0
00:34:19.031 --> 00:34:23.295
<v Josh Sparkes>What in terms of label priority with us
and how do you prioritise?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/163-1
00:34:23.295 --> 00:34:26.285
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry that you can tell me from this
question.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/163-2
00:34:26.285 --> 00:34:30.676
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just from a change perspective
because if you have a clear like</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/163-3
00:34:30.676 --> 00:34:34.812
<v Josh Sparkes>prioritisation matrix,
it's just you just manage the expectation</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/163-4
00:34:34.812 --> 00:34:38.311
<v Josh Sparkes>of the business and hopefully you get
less escalation.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/164-0
00:34:38.471 --> 00:34:41.573
<v Josh Sparkes>And it must push back.
We have that one hour window.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/164-1
00:34:41.573 --> 00:34:45.143
<v Josh Sparkes>So for for this team,
it's all about that one hour window of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/164-2
00:34:45.143 --> 00:34:49.357
<v Josh Sparkes>managing expectations from the
stakeholder because the expectations are</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/164-3
00:34:49.357 --> 00:34:52.225
<v Josh Sparkes>high.
So our first one hour window is all about,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/164-4
00:34:52.225 --> 00:34:55.151
<v Josh Sparkes>can we accommodate it with the existing
workload?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/165-0
00:34:55.551 --> 00:34:58.498
<v Josh Sparkes>If we can't,
can we move anything around in terms of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/165-1
00:34:58.498 --> 00:35:01.444
<v Josh Sparkes>the timeline,
can we utilise Brisbane to utilise the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/165-2
00:35:01.444 --> 00:35:04.056
<v Josh Sparkes>two time zones and we then look at what
it is,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/165-3
00:35:04.056 --> 00:35:08.281
<v Josh Sparkes>so if it's without getting too detailed
it's about then the categorization.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/165-4
00:35:08.281 --> 00:35:12.895
<v Josh Sparkes>So if it's a press release for example,
that needs to go on the website instantly.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/165-5
00:35:12.895 --> 00:35:14.951
<v Josh Sparkes>What if you put that a press release?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/166-0
00:35:15.031 --> 00:35:20.218
<v Josh Sparkes>Especially if there's things like Russia,
sanctions trackers again on the website</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/166-1
00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:25.151
<v Josh Sparkes>that needs to be updated straight away
and so there's certain categorizations</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/166-2
00:35:25.151 --> 00:35:30.274
<v Josh Sparkes>that need to be prioritised over others
and others that can then be pushed back.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/166-3
00:35:30.274 --> 00:35:32.551
<v Josh Sparkes>So what is our negotiation timeline?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/167-0
00:35:34.191 --> 00:35:38.037
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we're setting the expectations
of stakeholder within that hour.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/167-1
00:35:38.037 --> 00:35:41.935
<v Josh Sparkes>So all of that decision making is then
discussed within that hour window.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/167-2
00:35:41.935 --> 00:35:44.937
<v Josh Sparkes>What if you want,
what if what you want to push back on,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/167-3
00:35:44.937 --> 00:35:48.150
<v Josh Sparkes>you've already agreed to something else
with another person.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/167-4
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:52.311
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you let the two partners work it out
or the two senior people on the field?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/168-0
00:35:52.391 --> 00:35:55.138
<v Josh Sparkes>The earnings,
I sort it out or do you have to go back</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/168-1
00:35:55.138 --> 00:35:59.258
<v Josh Sparkes>and like backtrack whatever you promised
in that first hour if you have another,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/168-2
00:35:59.258 --> 00:36:03.378
<v Josh Sparkes>should we go back and say when if we've
explored all options and we're unable to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/168-3
00:36:03.378 --> 00:36:06.735
<v Josh Sparkes>facilitate it within the timelines,
that's going to be goes back.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/168-4
00:36:06.735 --> 00:36:08.311
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can capture I know Mark.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/170-0
00:36:08.831 --> 00:36:12.886
<v Josh Sparkes>Are we going to interject that here?
So you have it sounds from those</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/170-1
00:36:12.886 --> 00:36:17.230
<v Josh Sparkes>conversations you have levels of
prioritisation or just that press release</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/170-2
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:21.516
<v Josh Sparkes>that needs to to go immediately.
And then I don't know if you can provide</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/170-3
00:36:21.516 --> 00:36:26.324
<v Josh Sparkes>us with the next sort of categorisation,
but those things at the request point you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/170-4
00:36:26.324 --> 00:36:28.351
<v Josh Sparkes>can give some managing expectation.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/171-0
00:36:28.471 --> 00:36:30.887
<v Josh Sparkes>Upfront,
so when they're completing that form in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/169-0
00:36:29.271 --> 00:36:29.591
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/171-1
00:36:30.887 --> 00:36:33.549
<v Josh Sparkes>service now,
it could be this is you know you're sort</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/171-2
00:36:33.549 --> 00:36:37.542
<v Josh Sparkes>of holding hand and guiding them so that
it doesn't become noisy as soon as they</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/171-3
00:36:37.542 --> 00:36:40.205
<v Josh Sparkes>press submit.
The next communication you get for them</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/171-4
00:36:40.205 --> 00:36:42.423
<v Josh Sparkes>is where is it,
you know that type of thing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/171-5
00:36:42.423 --> 00:36:43.951
<v Josh Sparkes>So you could say press release.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/172-0
00:36:44.231 --> 00:36:46.997
<v Josh Sparkes>That becomes, you know,
it's going to be prioritised,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/172-1
00:36:46.997 --> 00:36:50.582
<v Josh Sparkes>so when it hits service now and the
dashboarding, it's there visible.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/172-2
00:36:50.582 --> 00:36:54.321
<v Josh Sparkes>But these are the amount of press
releases we need to do and it could do</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/172-3
00:36:54.321 --> 00:36:57.189
<v Josh Sparkes>service time to do a lot of that heavy
lifting for you.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/172-4
00:36:57.189 --> 00:37:00.313
<v Josh Sparkes>But you're not moving around.
You can make that suggestions.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/172-5
00:37:00.313 --> 00:37:03.591
<v Josh Sparkes>These are P ones that have got to be done
now these are P twos.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/174-0
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:08.871
<v Josh Sparkes>And do that categorization for you and
that's visible on that dashboard.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/173-0
00:37:06.711 --> 00:37:06.911
<v Mark Sedge>Well.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/177-0
00:37:09.991 --> 00:37:15.600
<v Mark Sedge>In support of that sort of question,
there is is it is it feasible that your</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/175-0
00:37:10.591 --> 00:37:10.631
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/177-1
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.752
<v Mark Sedge>you know your customers of your process
that they could,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/177-2
00:37:19.752 --> 00:37:25.216
<v Mark Sedge>you know have a notice of some sort of
like notice period to get something</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/177-3
00:37:25.216 --> 00:37:25.871
<v Mark Sedge>executed?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/179-0
00:37:26.351 --> 00:37:30.164
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. And therefore follow it.
Or is it that genuinely there are some</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/179-1
00:37:30.164 --> 00:37:33.268
<v Mark Sedge>stuff that just blows up that you've got
to resolve you,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/179-2
00:37:33.268 --> 00:37:37.298
<v Mark Sedge>but it's the majority stuff that say,
for example, to do a press release,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/179-3
00:37:37.298 --> 00:37:40.403
<v Mark Sedge>we need, you know,
24 hours notice to be able, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/178-0
00:37:38.111 --> 00:37:38.231
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/179-4
00:37:40.403 --> 00:37:44.978
<v Mark Sedge>to try and give you a bit of that control.
So not just set expectations of what you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/179-5
00:37:44.978 --> 00:37:45.631
<v Mark Sedge>can achieve.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/180-0
00:37:45.831 --> 00:37:51.506
<v Mark Sedge>But almost try and give a bit of a lead
time for some of these things that can be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/180-1
00:37:51.506 --> 00:37:54.758
<v Mark Sedge>positioned with the business units
themselves.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/180-2
00:37:54.758 --> 00:37:59.948
<v Mark Sedge>You know to gain stem the flow of your
reactive response to you know their</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/180-3
00:37:59.948 --> 00:38:02.231
<v Mark Sedge>urgency, what's the view on that?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/181-0
00:38:03.271 --> 00:38:06.002
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So I think that's where the communication</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/181-1
00:38:06.002 --> 00:38:09.813
<v Josh Sparkes>between like manager TL specialist
coordinator primarily comes in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/181-2
00:38:09.813 --> 00:38:14.363
<v Josh Sparkes>So if I think about a case where we've
got an urgent publication because it's a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/181-3
00:38:14.363 --> 00:38:18.288
<v Josh Sparkes>judgement that's being released and
they're working on it overnight,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/181-4
00:38:18.288 --> 00:38:19.311
<v Josh Sparkes>they need someone.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/182-0
00:38:19.751 --> 00:38:22.668
<v Josh Sparkes>To put it on website,
that would be something generally that I</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/182-1
00:38:22.668 --> 00:38:26.326
<v Josh Sparkes>would get a heads up of and so the word
contact me say this needs to go on the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/182-2
00:38:26.326 --> 00:38:28.502
<v Josh Sparkes>website.
This is probably looking for it to be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/182-3
00:38:28.502 --> 00:38:30.863
<v Josh Sparkes>released.
They don't actually know when it's going</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/182-4
00:38:30.863 --> 00:38:34.011
<v Josh Sparkes>to be released to market,
so they're working in the background with</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/182-5
00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:36.511
<v Josh Sparkes>that being to change potentially when it
is released.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/185-0
00:38:37.151 --> 00:38:39.602
<v Josh Sparkes>Which is a lot of why it has been
reactive,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/185-1
00:38:39.602 --> 00:38:44.169
<v Josh Sparkes>but the proactive element that we have is
that they can then give us the heads up</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/185-2
00:38:44.169 --> 00:38:46.786
<v Josh Sparkes>so we can reprioritize work to
accommodate it,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/185-3
00:38:46.786 --> 00:38:50.406
<v Josh Sparkes>to allow us to then put it in.
So when the information is ready,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/183-0
00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:48.111
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/185-4
00:38:50.406 --> 00:38:53.971
<v Josh Sparkes>we already know about,
we've already got Mandy sitting ready to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/185-5
00:38:53.971 --> 00:38:56.031
<v Josh Sparkes>pack it up and we've cleared hardest.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/184-0
00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:55.351
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/187-0
00:38:56.631 --> 00:39:00.139
<v Josh Sparkes>Of everything else, so it could be, yes,
that heads up, as you say,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/186-0
00:38:58.231 --> 00:38:58.631
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/187-1
00:39:00.139 --> 00:39:03.440
<v Josh Sparkes>that you know it's coming.
That's the that's the key bit. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/187-2
00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.380
<v Josh Sparkes>that's really important.
And you and you often get that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/187-3
00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:09.010
<v Josh Sparkes>So it could be that it's not the request
to do it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/187-4
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:13.188
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a there's a little process before,
but when they're filling in the form,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/187-5
00:39:13.188 --> 00:39:16.231
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, not going to get heads up form.
But it could be.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/188-0
00:39:16.511 --> 00:39:20.838
<v Josh Sparkes>Free information or pre press release
info as part of that form and then you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/188-1
00:39:20.838 --> 00:39:25.164
<v Josh Sparkes>would you would get it as a notification.
You'll be informed and it's on the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/188-2
00:39:25.164 --> 00:39:29.378
<v Josh Sparkes>dashboard and it's already there in
service now that you've got, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/188-3
00:39:29.378 --> 00:39:32.525
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe there's an effective date that you
need to do it,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/188-4
00:39:32.525 --> 00:39:35.671
<v Josh Sparkes>that it could be actually this is today
is going to be.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/189-0
00:39:35.911 --> 00:39:40.004
<v Josh Sparkes>We're going to do it overnight and you're
going to get it tomorrow morning,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/189-1
00:39:40.004 --> 00:39:43.127
<v Josh Sparkes>so at least you've got that window so you
can prioritise.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/189-2
00:39:43.127 --> 00:39:46.789
<v Josh Sparkes>That's 9:00 tomorrow morning.
That's where we're ready to go. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/189-3
00:39:46.789 --> 00:39:50.397
<v Josh Sparkes>and the the way the global content
calendar works is very similar,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/189-4
00:39:50.397 --> 00:39:54.651
<v Josh Sparkes>and it is more about like the business
using the form in the right way and can</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/189-5
00:39:54.651 --> 00:39:55.351
<v Josh Sparkes>sometimes be.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/190-0
00:39:55.751 --> 00:39:59.671
<v Josh Sparkes>Because if you put it in to the forum,
it gives us that early notification to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/190-1
00:39:59.671 --> 00:40:03.038
<v Josh Sparkes>say that this is coming,
but we don't have all the information yet</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/190-2
00:40:03.038 --> 00:40:06.707
<v Josh Sparkes>to which when they do have the
information we get the trigger that sends</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/190-3
00:40:06.707 --> 00:40:09.169
<v Josh Sparkes>us the information to make it start on
the work.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/190-4
00:40:09.169 --> 00:40:13.189
<v Josh Sparkes>But we've already allocated bandage that
piece of work because we had the early</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/190-5
00:40:13.189 --> 00:40:15.551
<v Josh Sparkes>notification. Yeah,
it doesn't always come in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/191-0
00:40:15.631 --> 00:40:18.318
<v Josh Sparkes>And that way,
and that's why I'll come maybe to me,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/191-1
00:40:18.318 --> 00:40:22.451
<v Josh Sparkes>to Claudia to in the different labels
within the team of here's a heads up that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/191-2
00:40:22.451 --> 00:40:26.120
<v Josh Sparkes>I really need support on that,
but it depends on where it's coming and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/191-3
00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.548
<v Josh Sparkes>from what part of the firm that's coming
from.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/191-4
00:40:28.548 --> 00:40:32.526
<v Josh Sparkes>And just I think could to most press
releases they could have had a heads up</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/191-5
00:40:32.526 --> 00:40:35.471
<v Josh Sparkes>or is it just that they generally not for
press release.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/192-0
00:40:35.631 --> 00:40:38.155
<v Josh Sparkes>No, no,
it's more when it's like judgments,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/192-1
00:40:38.155 --> 00:40:41.138
<v Josh Sparkes>isn't it?
It's where there's where there's a change</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/192-2
00:40:41.138 --> 00:40:44.694
<v Josh Sparkes>in law where they've maybe had early
notification themselves.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/192-3
00:40:44.694 --> 00:40:48.766
<v Josh Sparkes>They are something they are like
anticipating there's going to happen.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/192-4
00:40:48.766 --> 00:40:52.551
<v Josh Sparkes>So sometimes they will just work in the
background, drafting the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/194-0
00:40:53.511 --> 00:40:57.899
<v Josh Sparkes>The article that they want to put up on
the website but just yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/194-1
00:40:57.899 --> 00:41:02.024
<v Josh Sparkes>but just waiting for the that judgement
to go out. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/194-2
00:41:02.024 --> 00:41:06.346
<v Josh Sparkes>And then when it's ready,
then we'll just let us know how this is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/194-3
00:41:06.346 --> 00:41:09.031
<v Josh Sparkes>the time to, like, put it on the website.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/197-0
00:41:07.071 --> 00:41:12.132
<v Mark Sedge>So so Mandy that it is it fair to say
there is an opportunity that if they're</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/195-0
00:41:09.951 --> 00:41:10.071
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/197-1
00:41:12.132 --> 00:41:17.193
<v Mark Sedge>already drafting something that they
could give you the heads up at the point</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/196-0
00:41:15.231 --> 00:41:15.831
<v Josh Sparkes>Mm-hmm.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/197-2
00:41:17.193 --> 00:41:22.253
<v Mark Sedge>to which they're doing the drafting to
reduce the the the chances of a clash.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/197-3
00:41:22.253 --> 00:41:25.951
<v Mark Sedge>So maybe what we could do on the with a
type of request.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/199-0
00:41:25.991 --> 00:41:30.829
<v Mark Sedge>Test form where they're asking for that
they could do initial placeholder your</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/199-1
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:33.951
<v Mark Sedge>request that comes into you to say it's
happening.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/200-0
00:41:32.631 --> 00:41:37.735
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what we're saying. That's OK. Yeah.
Yeah, that's what we're saying.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/200-1
00:41:37.735 --> 00:41:41.410
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that 33 heads up,
and that's what the calendar is.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/202-0
00:41:37.951 --> 00:41:41.398
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, and.
And then and then because the tool set.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/202-1
00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:46.533
<v Mark Sedge>So because service now as a tool set
enables them to give you an attachment</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/200-2
00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:43.791
<v Josh Sparkes>That's the planning calendar. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/202-2
00:41:46.533 --> 00:41:50.655
<v Mark Sedge>after it's the they've registered the
request sort of thing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/202-3
00:41:50.655 --> 00:41:55.790
<v Mark Sedge>So you can add to that fine if we
recognise that's the behaviour pattern we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/201-0
00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:53.271
<v Josh Sparkes>Play song.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/202-4
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:56.871
<v Mark Sedge>could establish.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/203-0
00:41:57.191 --> 00:42:00.271
<v Mark Sedge>It's in such a way that it actively
facilitates that,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/203-1
00:42:00.271 --> 00:42:04.662
<v Mark Sedge>so they give you the heads up, you start,
you sign and shuffle your workload</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/203-2
00:42:04.662 --> 00:42:07.514
<v Mark Sedge>accordingly,
and then when they have the article,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/203-3
00:42:07.514 --> 00:42:11.620
<v Mark Sedge>they then attach the article,
you get notified it's in and then off you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/203-4
00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:11.791
<v Mark Sedge>go.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/204-0
00:42:13.391 --> 00:42:16.853
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I think once the content calendar has</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/204-1
00:42:16.853 --> 00:42:20.943
<v Josh Sparkes>launched,
we basically this is the approach that we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/204-2
00:42:20.943 --> 00:42:25.427
<v Josh Sparkes>are working on right now.
So for most of the publication</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/204-3
00:42:25.427 --> 00:42:30.855
<v Josh Sparkes>publications on the website,
we got advanced notifications that just</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/204-4
00:42:30.855 --> 00:42:32.271
<v Josh Sparkes>work the way that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/205-0
00:42:32.671 --> 00:42:36.331
<v Josh Sparkes>You just describe isn't an ideal word.
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/205-1
00:42:36.331 --> 00:42:40.351
<v Josh Sparkes>you you have the intro to the form,
which you could share with us.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/205-2
00:42:40.351 --> 00:42:44.731
<v Josh Sparkes>That has the information. Yeah.
And then I suppose it's touching on that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/205-3
00:42:44.731 --> 00:42:49.651
<v Josh Sparkes>you call it the global content calendar.
Yeah. So that's in addition to the form.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/205-4
00:42:49.651 --> 00:42:50.911
<v Josh Sparkes>Or is it this is the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/206-0
00:42:51.791 --> 00:42:55.915
<v Josh Sparkes>So as well the form. Yeah,
it's not so it works with the operational</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/206-1
00:42:55.915 --> 00:42:58.425
<v Josh Sparkes>form.
So it pulls from the categories for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/206-2
00:42:58.425 --> 00:43:01.951
<v Josh Sparkes>publications distribution and and to
action less occasion.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/206-3
00:43:01.951 --> 00:43:06.791
<v Josh Sparkes>So it works in conjunction with that form
that gives us the cases in shareville.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/207-0
00:43:07.191 --> 00:43:10.822
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's on SharePoint,
you fill in the calendar and then when</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/207-1
00:43:10.822 --> 00:43:14.979
<v Josh Sparkes>they complete the calendar without the
information that pins to share,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/207-2
00:43:14.979 --> 00:43:19.371
<v Josh Sparkes>well we get case reallocated to Mandy.
They upload the content it's that's</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/207-3
00:43:19.371 --> 00:43:22.650
<v Josh Sparkes>another case to us that we merge and make
into Mandy's.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/207-4
00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:26.631
<v Josh Sparkes>And then if there's anything else as a
distribution or interaction.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/208-0
00:43:26.751 --> 00:43:31.256
<v Josh Sparkes>Create other cases because we're seen as
three different things,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/208-1
00:43:31.256 --> 00:43:34.375
<v Josh Sparkes>but work together as one distribution.
Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/208-2
00:43:34.375 --> 00:43:39.158
<v Josh Sparkes>I can hear Paul Parikh churning away
technically solutionizing that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/208-3
00:43:39.158 --> 00:43:41.791
<v Josh Sparkes>So just to summarise them in the form.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/209-0
00:43:42.471 --> 00:43:46.638
<v Josh Sparkes>Free information and the calendar there
is for scheduling and the events.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/209-1
00:43:46.638 --> 00:43:50.861
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean it could be that in ServiceNow not
to solutionize is that that is a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/209-2
00:43:50.861 --> 00:43:53.958
<v Josh Sparkes>combination that's a form.
We've got that information.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/209-3
00:43:53.958 --> 00:43:58.068
<v Josh Sparkes>It's probably touching the point what
more information is in that global</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/209-4
00:43:58.068 --> 00:44:01.671
<v Josh Sparkes>content calendar that you need that isn't
captured on the form.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/210-0
00:44:02.071 --> 00:44:07.050
<v Josh Sparkes>That might be useful to see as well,
and combining the two so that when it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/210-1
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.702
<v Josh Sparkes>hits ServiceNow,
you've got that green work assignment</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/210-2
00:44:10.702 --> 00:44:15.282
<v Josh Sparkes>prioritisation and then you've got enough
information to start that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/210-3
00:44:15.282 --> 00:44:20.527
<v Josh Sparkes>I suppose it's understanding that global
content calendar is it literally just</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/210-4
00:44:20.527 --> 00:44:20.991
<v Josh Sparkes>like a.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/211-0
00:44:22.071 --> 00:44:26.361
<v Josh Sparkes>Calendar exactly what you've just said
there all the information that we need in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/211-1
00:44:26.361 --> 00:44:28.850
<v Josh Sparkes>order to create a publication in the back
end.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/211-2
00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:31.392
<v Josh Sparkes>So in the view that we have that all
completed,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/211-3
00:44:31.392 --> 00:44:34.358
<v Josh Sparkes>we can take that information and put it
on the website,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/211-4
00:44:34.358 --> 00:44:38.383
<v Josh Sparkes>probably depend on the size of the
article, which means being whatever, OK,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/211-5
00:44:38.383 --> 00:44:41.031
<v Josh Sparkes>in a line to what you say actually just
the form.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/212-0
00:44:41.151 --> 00:44:47.555
<v Josh Sparkes>And the information and the dates as one
input into in one place would be more</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/212-1
00:44:47.555 --> 00:44:51.527
<v Josh Sparkes>efficient.
I mean here to like show you what the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/212-2
00:44:51.527 --> 00:44:56.148
<v Josh Sparkes>calendar. Yeah,
it's quite difficult to explain what the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/212-3
00:44:56.148 --> 00:44:59.471
<v Josh Sparkes>technical aspects on the back end of CMS.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/213-0
00:45:00.151 --> 00:45:04.814
<v Josh Sparkes>Content management system that we use,
that's all the information that's key to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/213-1
00:45:04.814 --> 00:45:07.438
<v Josh Sparkes>like your seos,
how it's seen in the market,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/213-2
00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:10.352
<v Josh Sparkes>how it's found on Google,
how it's in searchable,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/213-3
00:45:10.352 --> 00:45:15.073
<v Josh Sparkes>that's all the key information that then
is put into the global content calendar</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/213-4
00:45:15.073 --> 00:45:19.911
<v Josh Sparkes>that feeds into the team as well as what
is actually visible visibly available to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/214-0
00:45:19.991 --> 00:45:24.517
<v Josh Sparkes>See on the website there's a lot of back
end information that's required as part</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/214-1
00:45:24.517 --> 00:45:27.869
<v Josh Sparkes>of which they're not.
They're not inputting is being pulled</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/214-2
00:45:27.869 --> 00:45:31.612
<v Josh Sparkes>from that content management system,
is that right? Or they enter?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/214-3
00:45:31.612 --> 00:45:34.070
<v Josh Sparkes>It's going into the calendar,
let's say 19.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/214-4
00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.751
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean it it's going into the calendar,
but in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/216-0
00:45:37.511 --> 00:45:43.801
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it worth being more on it? Yeah. Yeah.
Should we just go around? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/216-1
00:45:43.801 --> 00:45:48.204
<v Josh Sparkes>Mark and parrot.
We're just going to have a look at the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/216-2
00:45:48.204 --> 00:45:51.191
<v Josh Sparkes>global content calendar, if that's OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/215-0
00:45:52.071 --> 00:45:52.991
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, no worries.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/218-0
00:45:54.591 --> 00:45:55.751
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just going to join the call.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/219-0
00:45:59.871 --> 00:46:03.311
<v Mark Sedge>I've I've let Mandy into the call,
so she should be able to share.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/220-0
00:46:03.071 --> 00:46:06.940
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Mark,
because I think it's all we're talking</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/220-1
00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.615
<v Josh Sparkes>about.
It sort of system and then they people,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/220-2
00:46:09.615 --> 00:46:13.142
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just what, who's doing,
what that would be very helpful.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/220-3
00:46:13.142 --> 00:46:13.711
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/221-0
00:46:16.031 --> 00:46:17.991
<v Josh Sparkes>So I can share my screen now, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/222-0
00:46:20.231 --> 00:46:20.351
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/223-0
00:46:26.951 --> 00:46:30.859
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've only got the form that's come
in populated. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/223-1
00:46:30.859 --> 00:46:35.743
<v Josh Sparkes>So this is the the global content
calendar that we're talking about. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/223-2
00:46:35.743 --> 00:46:38.479
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So you can see just a calendar with</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/223-3
00:46:38.479 --> 00:46:39.911

<v Josh Sparkes>Each of each entry represents like
publications that need to be go on the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/224-1
00:46:46.263 --> 00:46:52.340
<v Josh Sparkes>websites okay and somebody has gone in.
The request has to go into that calendar</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/224-2

<v Josh Sparkes>So what's this like?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/225-0
00:46:59.831 --> 00:47:03.161
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry, sorry.
I might be asking a lot of questions here.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/225-1
00:47:03.161 --> 00:47:06.958
<v Josh Sparkes>So let's say a fee earner.
Let's say for example a fee earner or</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/225-2
00:47:06.958 --> 00:47:10.346

<v Josh Sparkes>about a change of judgement.
They go into the form which feeds into</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/225-4
00:47:14.318 --> 00:47:16.946
<v Josh Sparkes>this,
not really the fee earner will go into</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/225-5
00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:18.231

<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah,
we'll go and check in the calendar or the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/226-2
00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:29.861
<v Josh Sparkes>calendar. Yeah,

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/226-3
00:47:29.861 --> 00:47:33.700
<v Josh Sparkes>So this is the calendar. Yes.
And the and inside the calendar,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/226-4
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.991
<v Josh Sparkes>we need to double click is a form that
they populate.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/227-0
00:47:37.431 --> 00:47:41.406
<v Josh Sparkes>So for example,
if they want to and is that the scheduled</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/227-1
00:47:41.406 --> 00:47:46.546
<v Josh Sparkes>date for it to be published or the
scheduled date for you to help schedule</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/227-2
00:47:46.546 --> 00:47:50.726
<v Josh Sparkes>days to go published.
So you see we have cases schedule next</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/227-3
00:47:50.726 --> 00:47:54.564
<v Josh Sparkes>month, early next month.
So these are all the scheduled</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/227-4
00:47:54.564 --> 00:47:57.031
<v Josh Sparkes>publications that need to go out so.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/228-0
00:47:57.271 --> 00:48:01.882
<v Josh Sparkes>Once they put an entry here,
we got like a notification saying</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/228-1
00:48:01.882 --> 00:48:07.224
<v Josh Sparkes>something like we've got an entry in the
new entry in the Global Canada,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/228-2
00:48:07.224 --> 00:48:11.103
<v Josh Sparkes>something need to be put on the website.
Okay. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/228-3
00:48:11.103 --> 00:48:16.591
<v Josh Sparkes>And I thought actually it might be by 9
AM, 10:00 AM. So it's just by day.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/229-0
00:48:16.991 --> 00:48:21.113
<v Josh Sparkes>You populate it, but you populate a day.
Essentially,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/229-1
00:48:21.113 --> 00:48:26.839
<v Josh Sparkes>how many people have access to that
calendar to add stuff? Do you imagine?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/229-2
00:48:26.839 --> 00:48:31.571
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Anybody, anybody.
I think you said business development</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/229-3
00:48:31.571 --> 00:48:36.151
<v Josh Sparkes>tend to be done primary users,
but anybody could you could.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/230-0
00:48:36.551 --> 00:48:39.005
<v Josh Sparkes>So talk to see.
You could do a press release,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/230-1
00:48:39.005 --> 00:48:40.071
<v Josh Sparkes>Alex this afternoon.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/231-0
00:48:48.631 --> 00:48:51.623
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
it's good to know that your guide for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/231-1
00:48:51.623 --> 00:48:56.858
<v Josh Sparkes>everything that may appear in it.
So you go in. Yeah, just select the dates.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/231-2
00:48:56.858 --> 00:49:02.093
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, they go in. And as an entry.
And this is all the information that they</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/231-3
00:49:02.093 --> 00:49:05.900
<v Josh Sparkes>need to complete.
So the publication brief they need to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/231-4
00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.871
<v Josh Sparkes>give us the publication date.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/232-0
00:49:10.671 --> 00:49:13.978
<v Josh Sparkes>So so can I take that one?
Is it more charging,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/232-1
00:49:13.978 --> 00:49:19.558
<v Josh Sparkes>is it you get out this one to say this
corporate forms not have to sign off from</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/232-2
00:49:19.558 --> 00:49:22.796
<v Josh Sparkes>the fact that these things are going out
here.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/232-3
00:49:22.796 --> 00:49:26.791
<v Josh Sparkes>You're saying like everybody in the firm
can say we will.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/233-0
00:49:27.271 --> 00:49:33.750
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean Chiller has to be some kind of.
I think we're going to get to that sort</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/233-1
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:40.065
<v Josh Sparkes>of who I'm just thinking what point of
view that must be an approval process</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/233-2
00:49:40.065 --> 00:49:41.951
<v Josh Sparkes>rather than stop press.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/235-0
00:49:44.311 --> 00:49:46.674
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
I was going to ask the same question</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/234-0
00:49:45.391 --> 00:49:47.191
<v Josh Sparkes>Not at all.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/235-1
00:49:46.674 --> 00:49:50.135
<v Mark Sedge>because isn't there like the proof?
There's the logic will be,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/235-2
00:49:50.135 --> 00:49:52.718
<v Mark Sedge>there's a proofread first there's a,
you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/235-3
00:49:52.718 --> 00:49:56.893
<v Mark Sedge>validation that the content is correct,
etcetera. And then there's a final,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/235-4
00:49:56.893 --> 00:49:59.421
<v Mark Sedge>you know,
brand sort of kind of authorization</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/235-5
00:49:59.421 --> 00:50:02.607
<v Mark Sedge>before it's released.
I assume there's a similar controls</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/235-6
00:50:02.607 --> 00:50:03.431
<v Mark Sedge>process, right?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/236-0
00:50:03.511 --> 00:50:03.631
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/237-0
00:50:04.311 --> 00:50:07.715
<v Josh Sparkes>Well, that's my question,
but I'm just assume because it's about</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/237-1
00:50:07.715 --> 00:50:11.905
<v Josh Sparkes>the workflow you would need to know all
of those checkpoints and who does it go</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/237-2
00:50:11.905 --> 00:50:15.990
<v Josh Sparkes>to? How does it get sent off? Well,
it's who even that step before is the pre</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/237-3
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:20.231
<v Josh Sparkes>approval that this release is going to
happen. You know, rather than stop press.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/238-0
00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:24.479
<v Josh Sparkes>Something. Yeah. Yeah.
So I think what was on the website</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/238-1
00:50:24.479 --> 00:50:28.737
<v Josh Sparkes>primarily comes from the lawyers.
So they're writing the articles for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/238-2
00:50:28.737 --> 00:50:32.630
<v Josh Sparkes>insights and for press releases.
They're also doing it as well.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/238-3
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:36.340
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's the two core areas on the
website that we support.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/238-4
00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:40.111
<v Josh Sparkes>So lawyers do website. Yeah.
So they're writing the insights.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/239-0
00:50:40.471 --> 00:50:43.203
<v Josh Sparkes>They're right in the press releases
generally,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/239-1
00:50:43.203 --> 00:50:45.760
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe with PR support for the pest
release,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/239-2
00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:50.293
<v Josh Sparkes>but generally speaking it's the lawyers
behind the content expertise are also</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/239-3
00:50:50.293 --> 00:50:54.535
<v Josh Sparkes>included in that largely speaking.
So whether it's partner, legal teams,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/239-4
00:50:54.535 --> 00:50:58.022
<v Josh Sparkes>expertise Council,
you're perfecting team can get involved.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/239-5
00:50:58.022 --> 00:50:59.591
<v Josh Sparkes>That's not to say that the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/240-0
00:50:59.911 --> 00:51:02.431
<v Josh Sparkes>Absolutely will be involved so they can
proofread the content.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/242-0
00:51:03.911 --> 00:51:09.544
<v Josh Sparkes>We so when at that point that's probably
all the steps from a legal perspective</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/242-1
00:51:09.544 --> 00:51:12.783
<v Josh Sparkes>that they're doing from the content
creation,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/242-2
00:51:12.783 --> 00:51:18.626
<v Josh Sparkes>it then comes on here and that's where we
pick it up. So from a brand perspective,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/242-3
00:51:18.626 --> 00:51:19.471
<v Josh Sparkes>we are then.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/243-0
00:51:19.791 --> 00:51:25.365
<v Josh Sparkes>Guiding the legal teams BD on how we can
present it on the website because there's</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/243-1
00:51:25.365 --> 00:51:30.535
<v Josh Sparkes>a lot of limitations with the website,
so it's more about how we can present</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/243-2
00:51:30.535 --> 00:51:35.571
<v Josh Sparkes>sector brand all brand guidelines but
also present the information in most</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/243-3
00:51:35.571 --> 00:51:36.511
<v Josh Sparkes>appealing way.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/244-0
00:51:37.031 --> 00:51:41.242
<v Josh Sparkes>Bearing in mind as content heavy,
it's just a lot of text,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/244-1
00:51:41.242 --> 00:51:45.951
<v Josh Sparkes>a lot of the time or a lot of links on
the website and then from.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/247-0
00:51:44.951 --> 00:51:50.189
<v Mark Sedge>So it's so. So just quick question.
So in theory your SLA clock starts when</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/247-1
00:51:50.189 --> 00:51:53.360
<v Mark Sedge>your hands on it rather than the prep
before.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/247-2
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:58.942
<v Mark Sedge>So we would need to be mindful that if
you know when when you're the ask service</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/245-0
00:51:54.791 --> 00:51:55.271
<v Josh Sparkes>It's.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/247-3
00:51:58.942 --> 00:52:04.111
<v Mark Sedge>clock starts and stops because you don't
want to have it start a point of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/246-0
00:52:03.551 --> 00:52:03.671
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/250-0
00:52:04.391 --> 00:52:08.940
<v Mark Sedge>Submission when they've got these other
teams involved doing the documentation,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/250-1
00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:11.896
<v Mark Sedge>etcetera,
you only really want to be measuring from</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/249-0
00:52:10.711 --> 00:52:10.871
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/250-2
00:52:11.896 --> 00:52:14.511
<v Mark Sedge>point at which it lands at you.
Is that fair?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/252-0
00:52:14.471 --> 00:52:17.987
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah, no,
it's when we get the final content. Well,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/252-1
00:52:17.987 --> 00:52:21.564
<v Josh Sparkes>agreed, inverted commas,
final content in from that second</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/252-2
00:52:21.564 --> 00:52:25.444
<v Josh Sparkes>notification where they've included the
attachment. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/251-0
00:52:24.751 --> 00:52:25.431
<v Mark Sedge>Got it. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/252-3
00:52:25.444 --> 00:52:28.475
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's lots of.
So you don't get involved in,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/252-4
00:52:28.475 --> 00:52:31.991
<v Josh Sparkes>you talk about a lot of pre cheques
beforehand, you know.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/253-0
00:52:32.951 --> 00:52:36.868
<v Josh Sparkes>Proofreading, but do you?
So that's inferred that that's already</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/253-1
00:52:36.868 --> 00:52:40.001
<v Josh Sparkes>been done.
Or do you go back and check the check so</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/253-2
00:52:40.001 --> 00:52:42.894
<v Josh Sparkes>we wouldn't check their check?
No policy check.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/253-3
00:52:42.894 --> 00:52:47.533
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's always a live check on this
process or internally within the team</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/253-4
00:52:47.533 --> 00:52:51.751
<v Josh Sparkes>before what was on the website.
So there's always that internal team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/254-0
00:52:52.071 --> 00:52:55.998
<v Josh Sparkes>To check and then it was on the website.
So in that inception.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/254-1
00:52:55.998 --> 00:53:00.736
<v Josh Sparkes>So for example I mean not to change this
form because but would would it be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/254-2
00:53:00.736 --> 00:53:05.723
<v Josh Sparkes>needing to say before the request gets to
you that you've done the proofreading</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/254-3
00:53:05.723 --> 00:53:10.398
<v Josh Sparkes>sort of hand holding them a little bit,
they could do their own check box,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/254-4
00:53:10.398 --> 00:53:11.831
<v Josh Sparkes>but 12345 proofreading?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/255-0
00:53:12.671 --> 00:53:15.724
<v Josh Sparkes>On brand,
you know to give to ensure that they know</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/255-1
00:53:15.724 --> 00:53:20.596
<v Josh Sparkes>that when they're passing it over to you
that these cheques have been officialized</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/255-2
00:53:20.596 --> 00:53:24.059
<v Josh Sparkes>from a content perspective, yes,
from a brand perspective,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/255-3
00:53:24.059 --> 00:53:28.520
<v Josh Sparkes>probably not because you need to
understand the capabilities of the system.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/255-4
00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.631
<v Josh Sparkes>Some BD do,
others don't from a technical aspect of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/256-0
00:53:31.951 --> 00:53:34.858
<v Josh Sparkes>The system? Yeah.
What it can and can't do,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/256-1
00:53:34.858 --> 00:53:39.548
<v Josh Sparkes>but from a content perspective,
we could incorporate that checklist in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/256-2
00:53:39.548 --> 00:53:43.049
<v Josh Sparkes>the original, you know? Yeah.
And the original form,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/256-3
00:53:43.049 --> 00:53:48.532
<v Josh Sparkes>it's that leading question that they've
done that. So they're responsible, but oh,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/256-4
00:53:48.532 --> 00:53:50.711
<v Josh Sparkes>you didn't tell me that I had to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/257-0
00:53:51.151 --> 00:53:53.743
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
you didn't pick up the proofreading or,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/257-1
00:53:53.743 --> 00:53:56.334
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
there's not blame such that it's a step</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/257-2
00:53:56.334 --> 00:54:00.272
<v Josh Sparkes>that they've completed that process and
it's a trigger for them to say, oh,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/257-3
00:54:00.272 --> 00:54:03.796
<v Josh Sparkes>let me just, OK, let me double,
double check. And then that's done.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/257-4
00:54:03.796 --> 00:54:07.528
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can certainly incorporate that for
your assurance that, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/257-5
00:54:07.528 --> 00:54:09.911
<v Josh Sparkes>it's been done before it lands with
yourself.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/258-0
00:54:12.391 --> 00:54:17.938
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's good. Can I just Scroll down?
So there's lots of information on there.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/258-1
00:54:17.938 --> 00:54:23.418
<v Josh Sparkes>Does that duplicate the form as well as
the duplicate information on this one of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/258-2
00:54:23.418 --> 00:54:26.191
<v Josh Sparkes>the previous form like effective date or?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/259-0
00:54:30.191 --> 00:54:30.231
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/260-0
00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:36.655
<v Josh Sparkes>Was it the duplicate?
You mean the community?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/260-1
00:54:36.655 --> 00:54:40.542
<v Josh Sparkes>So they they've got the original form
that they have to complete, correct?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/260-2
00:54:40.542 --> 00:54:43.859
<v Josh Sparkes>So this or this is the actual,
this is the actual form. Oh, OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/260-3

00:56:15.593 --> 00:56:20.374
<v Josh Sparkes>that's again not to solution as a paracle
mark that's you know that's something</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/265-4

<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
bread and butter of the of the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/266-1
00:56:24.583 --> 00:56:27.805
<v Josh Sparkes>identification.
When you follow that process,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/266-2
00:56:27.805 --> 00:56:32.147
<v Josh Sparkes>it does work. Yeah.
So if the lawyers and really follow this,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/266-3
00:56:32.147 --> 00:56:37.610
<v Josh Sparkes>we can deliver instantly within like a
really short timeline where we hit the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/266-4
00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:40.551
<v Josh Sparkes>pain point is where we don't utilise this.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/268-0
00:56:40.871 --> 00:56:45.434
<v Josh Sparkes>It's because we've we've had the the
heads up probably we're what we find here</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/268-1
00:56:45.434 --> 00:56:49.649
<v Josh Sparkes>is although we're anticipating that we
want to deliver on say, the 30th,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/268-2
00:56:49.649 --> 00:56:53.692
<v Josh Sparkes>we've not got final content.
So it's not us not meeting the deadline,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/268-3
00:56:53.692 --> 00:56:58.081
<v Josh Sparkes>it's we've not been provided the final
content in order to deliver in time.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/267-0
00:56:56.631 --> 00:56:58.871
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. And and in that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/268-4
00:56:58.081 --> 00:56:59.351
<v Josh Sparkes>And then what happens.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/269-0
00:57:00.271 --> 00:57:00.631
<v Mark Sedge>Go on.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/272-0
00:57:00.311 --> 00:57:03.612
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. And you could,
it works as there's a lot of drafters</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/272-1
00:57:03.612 --> 00:57:08.256
<v Josh Sparkes>back and forth. So there's a divisions.
So all the back and forth that can happen,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/270-0
00:57:05.151 --> 00:57:05.591
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/272-2
00:57:08.256 --> 00:57:12.900
<v Josh Sparkes>we just had one recently where the whole
day was taken up with one article because</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/272-3
00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:16.257
<v Josh Sparkes>that it wasn't final content to keep
rewriting the content.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/272-4
00:57:16.257 --> 00:57:18.551
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's what it's most time consuming.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/271-0
00:57:17.311 --> 00:57:17.471
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/273-0
00:57:19.351 --> 00:57:24.008
<v Josh Sparkes>Of those philtres final content awaiting
final content along your dashboard,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/273-1
00:57:24.008 --> 00:57:27.999
<v Josh Sparkes>you could have it categorised,
but you know we're not in place or</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/273-2
00:57:27.999 --> 00:57:32.596
<v Josh Sparkes>triggers to say you know your SLA is you
know the onus comes on themselves.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/273-3
00:57:32.596 --> 00:57:34.591
<v Josh Sparkes>They're also going to breach the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/274-0
00:57:35.511 --> 00:57:38.222
<v Josh Sparkes>Or the delivery of it because it's with
themselves.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/274-1
00:57:38.222 --> 00:57:42.340
<v Josh Sparkes>But you can get those insights that
actually the responsibility isn't covered.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/274-2
00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:45.833
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not. Again, it's not great.
It's just in order to manage your</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/274-3
00:57:45.833 --> 00:57:50.003
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow is that you're awaiting that
content and they can be triggered to have</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/274-4
00:57:50.003 --> 00:57:51.671
<v Josh Sparkes>that notification that it's due.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/276-0
00:57:52.111 --> 00:57:56.755
<v Josh Sparkes>You know they can get that, you know,
within 4 hours that they still need to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/275-0
00:57:53.231 --> 00:57:53.831
<v Mark Sedge>The value.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/276-1
00:57:56.755 --> 00:58:00.675
<v Josh Sparkes>get, you know, to is a lot of that.
Just a question on services,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/276-2
00:58:00.675 --> 00:58:04.535
<v Josh Sparkes>a lot of that time stamp.
So if I'm then given an escalation in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/276-3
00:58:04.535 --> 00:58:08.636
<v Josh Sparkes>relation to delivery time,
can I see when things were like added to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/276-4
00:58:08.636 --> 00:58:11.591
<v Josh Sparkes>the measurement? Yeah.
So behind the scenes all.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/279-0
00:58:09.711 --> 00:58:14.028
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So I was just about to,
I was just going to, sorry Deborah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/277-0
00:58:12.071 --> 00:58:14.151
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Yeah, sorry about that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/279-1
00:58:14.028 --> 00:58:19.326
<v Mark Sedge>I was just going to chip in say because
you've got all of the automatic systemic</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/279-2
00:58:19.326 --> 00:58:24.166
<v Mark Sedge>timestamps of when things come in,
when stuff gets yo and you've got that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/278-0
00:58:22.591 --> 00:58:22.711
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/279-3
00:58:24.166 --> 00:58:27.502
<v Mark Sedge>into the apps,
you can use that data to run simple</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/279-4
00:58:27.502 --> 00:58:29.071
<v Mark Sedge>reports to say how many.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/282-0
00:58:29.631 --> 00:58:32.601
<v Mark Sedge>Well,
last minute or how many didn't have the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/282-1
00:58:32.601 --> 00:58:37.314
<v Mark Sedge>documentation and therefore the impact on
your timeline and your demand.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/282-2
00:58:37.314 --> 00:58:42.221
<v Mark Sedge>So what you can do is you can use it to
model and report and then hopefully</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/280-0
00:58:38.031 --> 00:58:38.271
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/282-3
00:58:42.221 --> 00:58:47.516
<v Mark Sedge>upstream the leadership can influence the
community you're asking for this to say</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/281-0
00:58:43.151 --> 00:58:43.271
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/282-4
00:58:47.516 --> 00:58:48.871
<v Mark Sedge>this is what happens.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/284-0
00:58:49.071 --> 00:58:52.315
<v Mark Sedge>When you don't prepare yourselves,
this is what happened.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/284-1
00:58:52.315 --> 00:58:56.453
<v Mark Sedge>This is the implications on the
organisation and it makes it a little bit</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/284-2
00:58:56.453 --> 00:59:00.535
<v Mark Sedge>more of a bolder conversation about
adhering to the process as you need.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/284-3
00:59:00.535 --> 00:59:03.164
<v Mark Sedge>Because you said,
if they do it and follow it,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/283-0
00:59:02.911 --> 00:59:03.031
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/284-4
00:59:03.164 --> 00:59:06.351
<v Mark Sedge>you're really slick. It all works.
It's when they don't.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/285-0
00:59:07.551 --> 00:59:11.721
<v Josh Sparkes>And I think we do do that,
mark with our quarterly report and I know</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/285-1
00:59:11.721 --> 00:59:16.615
<v Josh Sparkes>that's one of the topics we want to chat
about, it's more of an overall picture.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/285-2
00:59:16.615 --> 00:59:21.751
<v Josh Sparkes>So where I've then used the data over the
quarter to identify for example, same day,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/285-3
00:59:21.751 --> 00:59:24.711
<v Josh Sparkes>next day turn around,
that's been conversations.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/288-0
00:59:24.871 --> 00:59:29.124
<v Josh Sparkes>I would have a leadership to say, well,
this percentage of the request that the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/288-1
00:59:29.124 --> 00:59:31.994
<v Josh Sparkes>team have used,
for example for Europe in like 60 odd</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/288-2
00:59:31.994 --> 00:59:36.406
<v Josh Sparkes>percent of the requests have either been
same day or next day and then once that's</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/286-0
00:59:36.071 --> 00:59:37.031
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/288-3
00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:39.595
<v Josh Sparkes>been highlighted,
they've worked with their senior teams in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/288-4
00:59:39.595 --> 00:59:43.529
<v Josh Sparkes>order to then really reduce and focus on
what is important because of the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/288-5
00:59:43.529 --> 00:59:44.751
<v Josh Sparkes>implications that does.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/287-0
00:59:44.631 --> 00:59:45.031
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/289-0
00:59:44.791 --> 00:59:48.031
<v Josh Sparkes>To have all my teams 100% with you on
that one because it does work.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/295-0
00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:51.703
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. The other,
the other thing we can do within the tool</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/290-0
00:59:51.551 --> 00:59:51.671
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/295-1
00:59:51.703 --> 00:59:56.190
<v Mark Sedge>set is if you're nearing a a publication
date and you haven't got anything in,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/291-0
00:59:53.831 --> 00:59:53.951
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/295-2
00:59:56.190 --> 01:00:00.904
<v Mark Sedge>we can flag up either on a dashboard or
via notification back to those people say,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/292-0
00:59:58.671 --> 00:59:58.791
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/295-3
01:00:00.904 --> 01:00:03.517
<v Mark Sedge>hey,
you haven't submitted your documentation</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/295-4
01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:08.231
<v Mark Sedge>yet and you're due to publish, you know,
so there's things we can do systemically.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/293-0
01:00:04.231 --> 01:00:04.351
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/294-0
01:00:05.431 --> 01:00:05.551
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/296-0
01:00:08.591 --> 01:00:11.431
<v Mark Sedge>To sort oil the wheels of that process
kind of thing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/297-0
01:00:12.391 --> 01:00:15.847
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that would be good. Jim.
There's a sense that the ownership is on</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/297-1
01:00:15.847 --> 01:00:19.687
<v Josh Sparkes>them to in order to provide that rather
than the ownership on you to chase them</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/297-2
01:00:19.687 --> 01:00:22.711
<v Josh Sparkes>to provide it. Yeah.
So there's a lot of chasing for the team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/297-3
01:00:22.711 --> 01:00:26.023
<v Josh Sparkes>So we're we're monitoring what their
workload in order to go, right,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/297-4
01:00:26.023 --> 01:00:29.527
<v Josh Sparkes>actually that's during the theory.
If I still don't have the content you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/297-5
01:00:29.527 --> 01:00:30.871
<v Josh Sparkes>need to deliver on that day.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/298-0
01:00:31.871 --> 01:00:35.825
<v Josh Sparkes>We're we're we're losing the window,
so that's then on the team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/298-1
01:00:35.825 --> 01:00:40.509
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's automatic notification of
where we've not got that a content that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/298-2
01:00:40.509 --> 01:00:45.011
<v Josh Sparkes>we're good to do, an automation there.
This is I mean I think it's great.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/298-3
01:00:45.011 --> 01:00:47.748
<v Josh Sparkes>You can see it,
but it's quite flat as well.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/298-4
01:00:47.748 --> 01:00:50.911
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got news in a sense you could
break it down.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/299-0
01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:56.294
<v Josh Sparkes>My status awaiting content got content,
you know, and those areas of priority.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/299-1
01:00:56.294 --> 01:01:00.893
<v Josh Sparkes>You can have a priority in there.
And so actually within ServiceNow</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/299-2
01:01:00.893 --> 01:01:06.303
<v Josh Sparkes>dashboard you can see OK that's on hold.
I'm awaiting that. I can work on this.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/299-3
01:01:06.303 --> 01:01:10.293
<v Josh Sparkes>I can turn it over.
There's lots of additional overlay and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/299-4
01:01:10.293 --> 01:01:10.631
<v Josh Sparkes>give.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/301-0
01:01:10.951 --> 01:01:15.422
<v Josh Sparkes>Rather than just new working progress
close, you've got all of those things.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/301-1
01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:20.125
<v Josh Sparkes>And who is it lined with at the current
state sign back assigned to them or it's</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/301-2
01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:24.828
<v Josh Sparkes>with on hold awaiting that information
and therefore I can work on the ones that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/301-3
01:01:24.828 --> 01:01:26.511
<v Josh Sparkes>I've got all the content for?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/302-0
01:01:27.551 --> 01:01:30.257
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
And I think from an ownership perspective</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/302-1
01:01:30.257 --> 01:01:32.963
<v Josh Sparkes>as well,
we'll need to engage with CMG MB MC on</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/302-2
01:01:32.963 --> 01:01:36.008
<v Josh Sparkes>this one because we don't actually own
this calendar.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/302-3
01:01:36.008 --> 01:01:39.503
<v Josh Sparkes>So anything that we want to change,
we'll just need to, yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/302-4
01:01:39.503 --> 01:01:43.900
<v Josh Sparkes>this calendar comes your ServiceNow
dashboard. Yeah, in that sense, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/302-5
01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.831
<v Josh Sparkes>and it's, you know,
by the day you can get a month.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/303-0
01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:50.281
<v Josh Sparkes>You get a week,
you get and you get your day view with</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/303-1
01:01:50.281 --> 01:01:54.603
<v Josh Sparkes>the clock ticking as it were, you know,
and equally from a global perspective,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/303-2
01:01:54.603 --> 01:01:58.707
<v Josh Sparkes>you know what you can be assigned to
Brisbane as well in that time window.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/303-3
01:01:58.707 --> 01:02:02.591
<v Josh Sparkes>So my question is probably going to be
along the lines of that around.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/304-0
01:02:03.151 --> 01:02:06.940
<v Josh Sparkes>Stakeholders are used to seeing that view
on SharePoint,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/304-1
01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:11.592
<v Josh Sparkes>so that's fine for internally we might be
able to see it differently,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/304-2
01:02:11.592 --> 01:02:14.715
<v Josh Sparkes>but how do we still provide that type of
view?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/304-3
01:02:14.715 --> 01:02:20.231
<v Josh Sparkes>Why to challenge back of that's an as is
today. So do they like to see it because?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/306-0
01:02:21.511 --> 01:02:24.042
<v Josh Sparkes>What? You know? Why do they need it?
You know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/306-1
01:02:24.042 --> 01:02:28.080
<v Josh Sparkes>is it or is it very selfish that I know
on the 30th I'm going to get this?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/306-2
01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.471
<v Josh Sparkes>Or do they like to have?
I need to see all the press releases.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/306-3
01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:35.778
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just wondering why it's nice to see
it. I mean, I'm enjoying what you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/306-4
01:02:35.778 --> 01:02:40.031
<v Josh Sparkes>seeing activity and the end of the month
seems to be looking quite busy. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/308-0
01:02:40.671 --> 01:02:45.821
<v Josh Sparkes>That's probably that's the pain point.
But why today purpose as it's the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/308-1
01:02:45.821 --> 01:02:51.605
<v Josh Sparkes>visibility to make sure we're not sending
out publications to the same clients or</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/308-2
01:02:51.605 --> 01:02:54.920
<v Josh Sparkes>spanning the clients as the the primary
focus,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/308-3
01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.671
<v Josh Sparkes>IE it's supposed to be a planning tool.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/307-0
01:02:57.471 --> 01:02:58.191
<v Mark Sedge>But week.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/310-0
01:02:58.671 --> 01:03:02.472
<v Josh Sparkes>For who and the legal teams,
but and do they? Or do they care?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/310-1
01:03:02.472 --> 01:03:07.056
<v Josh Sparkes>Or do they just say this is when they
want it? So that's when they want it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/309-0
01:03:02.591 --> 01:03:03.631
<v Mark Sedge>So so there is the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/310-2
01:03:07.056 --> 01:03:09.952
<v Josh Sparkes>They want to see it,
but at the end of the day,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/310-3
01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:14.777
<v Josh Sparkes>they want what they want, when they want.
It's when the level of change. Right?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/310-4
01:03:14.777 --> 01:03:17.431
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
Keep that away from our stakeholders.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/313-0
01:03:17.791 --> 01:03:22.308
<v Josh Sparkes>I know that they're used to seeing that,
but other patients are better or not.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/311-0
01:03:20.711 --> 01:03:20.951
<v Mark Sedge>So.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/313-1
01:03:22.308 --> 01:03:26.482
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know. We need to explore,
but it's more that change perspective.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/321-0
01:03:26.351 --> 01:03:30.917
<v Mark Sedge>I think The thing is team team from a
perspective of if if they get you know</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/313-2
01:03:26.482 --> 01:03:27.511
<v Josh Sparkes>If we remove that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/314-0
01:03:30.191 --> 01:03:30.311
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/321-1
01:03:30.917 --> 01:03:34.059
<v Mark Sedge>we're planning obviously to utilise
employee centre,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/315-0
01:03:33.151 --> 01:03:33.271
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/321-2
01:03:34.059 --> 01:03:38.803
<v Mark Sedge>there's no reason why there couldn't be a
simple link from employee centre to a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/316-0
01:03:34.431 --> 01:03:34.551
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/317-0
01:03:35.591 --> 01:03:35.711
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/318-0
01:03:36.791 --> 01:03:36.911
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/321-3
01:03:38.803 --> 01:03:42.123
<v Mark Sedge>view like this.
The other thing you could do with those</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/321-4
01:03:42.123 --> 01:03:44.791
<v Mark Sedge>guys is give them a specific dashboard
view.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/319-0
01:03:43.551 --> 01:03:43.671
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/326-0
01:03:45.391 --> 01:03:48.751
<v Mark Sedge>Right,
which would show Community publications,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/320-0
01:03:45.591 --> 01:03:45.711
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/326-1
01:03:48.751 --> 01:03:51.901
<v Mark Sedge>for example per customer group or,
you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/322-0
01:03:49.471 --> 01:03:49.551
<v Josh Sparkes>The.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/326-2
01:03:51.901 --> 01:03:56.731
<v Mark Sedge>things that they can actively interrogate
to make it richer through,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/323-0
01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:55.151
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/326-3
01:03:56.731 --> 01:04:01.841
<v Mark Sedge>like a dashboard or reporting.
So it wouldn't be real time. It might be,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/324-0
01:04:01.631 --> 01:04:01.751
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/326-4
01:04:01.841 --> 01:04:04.991
<v Mark Sedge>you know, day -1.
But they could easily see.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/329-0
01:04:05.071 --> 01:04:10.288
<v Mark Sedge>What was done over that previous period?
So what we would probably need to do is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/325-0
01:04:06.151 --> 01:04:06.271
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/327-0
01:04:07.271 --> 01:04:07.391
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/329-1
01:04:10.288 --> 01:04:15.246
<v Mark Sedge>look at their specific requirements of
what they want out of it and we could</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/329-2
01:04:15.246 --> 01:04:20.591
<v Mark Sedge>tailor something to be really smart for
them to utilise your employee centre view.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/328-0
01:04:15.471 --> 01:04:15.591
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/330-0
01:04:20.911 --> 01:04:21.791
<v Mark Sedge>To really help them.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/331-0
01:04:22.791 --> 01:04:25.445
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
And I think that's all I'm talking about</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/331-1
01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:29.791
<v Josh Sparkes>here is we don't want to just take it
away and not provide something or some</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/331-2
01:04:29.791 --> 01:04:34.364
<v Josh Sparkes>other sort of view we need to get them
some sort of view and say over it because</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/331-3
01:04:34.364 --> 01:04:38.315
<v Josh Sparkes>it's open to everyone, right.
It's not just the stakeholders that use</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/331-4
01:04:38.315 --> 01:04:40.629
<v Josh Sparkes>it,
is it anything like legal that legal</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/331-5
01:04:40.629 --> 01:04:41.871
<v Josh Sparkes>teams can input to it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/332-0
01:04:42.271 --> 01:04:49.400
<v Josh Sparkes>And from a leadership perspective,
there's also a report that's pulled of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/332-1
01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:56.046
<v Josh Sparkes>the publications and that goes to CMG
leadership, OK, could be nice.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/332-2
01:04:56.046 --> 01:05:01.151
<v Josh Sparkes>As Mark was saying that you could be,
these are the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/333-0
01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:05.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Lots of them are ahead of the deal ahead
of the deal, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/333-1
01:05:05.617 --> 01:05:08.050
<v Josh Sparkes>can start to be in Richard further.
You know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/333-2
01:05:08.050 --> 01:05:11.859
<v Josh Sparkes>these are the ones that we're doing next
week. Press release, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/333-3
01:05:11.859 --> 01:05:16.091
<v Josh Sparkes>could also provide that category to give
further information about how to drill</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/333-4
01:05:16.091 --> 01:05:20.059
<v Josh Sparkes>down, go what is the, what is that,
what is that one you know and drilling</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/333-5
01:05:20.059 --> 01:05:21.751
<v Josh Sparkes>further. So it could be telling.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/334-0
01:05:21.831 --> 01:05:25.586
<v Josh Sparkes>The story of what this week looked like
and what last week looked like and what</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/334-1
01:05:25.586 --> 01:05:29.246
<v Josh Sparkes>week ahead looks like absolutely order of
a requirements perspective from the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/334-2
01:05:29.246 --> 01:05:32.343
<v Josh Sparkes>stakeholders around how they would want
to view this information.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/334-3
01:05:32.343 --> 01:05:34.737
<v Josh Sparkes>Because I'm conscious they won't be on
ServiceNow,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/334-4
01:05:34.737 --> 01:05:37.271
<v Josh Sparkes>they'll only have their employees able to
see things.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/334-5
01:05:37.271 --> 01:05:39.711
<v Josh Sparkes>So we need to be really that way.
That'd be a nice.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/335-0
01:05:40.311 --> 01:05:43.316
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. We also take an action. Sorry,
Deborah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/335-1
01:05:43.316 --> 01:05:47.888
<v Josh Sparkes>that it's spread into the voice of the
customer, the work that Kelly,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/335-2
01:05:47.888 --> 01:05:51.481
<v Josh Sparkes>Martin and we can take lessons learned
from. I manage.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/335-3
01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:56.119
<v Josh Sparkes>I believe that's been rolled out to
business eliana's leading on that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/335-4
01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:59.711
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can find a way to just make sure
the visibility.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/336-0
01:05:59.751 --> 01:06:03.873
<v Josh Sparkes>It works for everyone to chillsbury the
other question I had was you said that it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/336-1
01:06:03.873 --> 01:06:07.241
<v Josh Sparkes>works a lot of the time when people are
on time, it's quite slick.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/336-2
01:06:07.241 --> 01:06:11.061
<v Josh Sparkes>What is the percentage or effort of your
time? Like if you had 100 tickets,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/336-3
01:06:11.061 --> 01:06:14.831
<v Josh Sparkes>how many are last minute and people
haven't got like their ducks in a row.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/337-0
01:06:15.231 --> 01:06:15.351
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/338-0
01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:20.345
<v Josh Sparkes>As a percentage, it's more just,
it's the other way around.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/338-1
01:06:20.345 --> 01:06:25.694
<v Josh Sparkes>It's we don't get the early notification,
it's everything comes at the same time.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/338-2
01:06:25.694 --> 01:06:30.912
<v Josh Sparkes>So they'll put it all in for the 28th,
including the content, all the back end.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/338-3
01:06:30.912 --> 01:06:32.151
<v Josh Sparkes>And that does work.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/339-0
01:06:32.511 --> 01:06:37.563
<v Josh Sparkes>But if we've not had early notification,
we have to reshuffle. Could I ask you,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/339-1
01:06:37.563 --> 01:06:41.542
<v Josh Sparkes>could you get early notification? Yes.
Is it possible? I mean,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/339-2
01:06:41.542 --> 01:06:44.573
<v Josh Sparkes>do they know that or? Yeah,
they working on it,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/339-3
01:06:44.573 --> 01:06:48.551
<v Josh Sparkes>I say so it is a change that once you are
start working on it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/340-0
01:06:49.031 --> 01:06:51.625
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a change of behaviour then in
stakeholders,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/340-1
01:06:51.625 --> 01:06:55.172
<v Josh Sparkes>and when do they start to work on it?
I mean, they're in a system.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/340-2
01:06:55.172 --> 01:06:59.618
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just thinking at that point almost we
can ultimate or pick up that trigger that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/340-3
01:06:59.618 --> 01:07:04.065
<v Josh Sparkes>they're working on on it so that they're
they don't have to go somewhere. You know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/340-4
01:07:04.065 --> 01:07:07.453
<v Josh Sparkes>you get that heads up.
So the legal teams will be working on it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/340-5
01:07:07.453 --> 01:07:08.511
<v Josh Sparkes>probably days ahead.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/341-0
01:07:08.711 --> 01:07:12.216
<v Josh Sparkes>So what kind of what it is,
but you're probably talking about two</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/341-1
01:07:12.216 --> 01:07:16.465
<v Josh Sparkes>days ahead of the actual release date.
It's whether that's been communicated to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/341-2
01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:20.289
<v Josh Sparkes>the CMG for it to be included here on the
calendar to give us the early</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/341-3
01:07:20.289 --> 01:07:24.272
<v Josh Sparkes>notification or is it a case of legal
teams haven't instructed the CMG to,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/341-4
01:07:24.272 --> 01:07:27.511
<v Josh Sparkes>which it's then all landed on the CMG,
then rolled on to us.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/342-0
01:07:27.751 --> 01:07:32.085
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So CNG know all of the heads up.
They are the no, they don't know either.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/342-1
01:07:32.085 --> 01:07:35.118
<v Josh Sparkes>So the legal team knows the heads up is
the legal team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/342-2
01:07:35.118 --> 01:07:39.506
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's where we can get each other and
be like we should try and talk to each</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/342-3
01:07:39.506 --> 01:07:42.702
<v Josh Sparkes>other. You know,
we have to look them in a lot of the time</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/342-4
01:07:42.702 --> 01:07:45.519
<v Josh Sparkes>and what happens is the legal team will
come to us.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/342-5
01:07:45.519 --> 01:07:47.631
<v Josh Sparkes>We had one for what we don't even have.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/343-0
01:07:48.031 --> 01:07:50.818
<v Josh Sparkes>ACMG online,
we then had to do it on behalf of the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/343-1
01:07:50.818 --> 01:07:54.371
<v Josh Sparkes>legal team, so there's there.
This is where we're having to work</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/343-2
01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:57.322
<v Josh Sparkes>backwards to get them to put it back into
the system,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/343-3
01:07:57.322 --> 01:08:01.529
<v Josh Sparkes>and even then that doesn't work because
the legal teams aren't used to this.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/343-4
01:08:01.529 --> 01:08:05.901
<v Josh Sparkes>So we're getting opportunities to use the
changing system to push the change of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/343-5
01:08:05.901 --> 01:08:07.431
<v Josh Sparkes>behaviour through it, right.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/344-0
01:08:08.471 --> 01:08:11.020
<v Josh Sparkes>You know there will be a big change and
I'm sorry,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/344-1
01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:15.167
<v Josh Sparkes>what communications do you currently have
with your stakeholders? So for instance,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/344-2
01:08:15.167 --> 01:08:18.065
<v Josh Sparkes>those that are constantly last minute for
getting people,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/344-3
01:08:18.065 --> 01:08:21.812
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just guessing like the lawyers that
generally write these articles are</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/344-4
01:08:21.812 --> 01:08:23.111
<v Josh Sparkes>typically the same people.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/345-0
01:08:24.071 --> 01:08:27.362
<v Josh Sparkes>What channels of communication?
Or is it always you through your</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/345-1
01:08:27.362 --> 01:08:31.716
<v Josh Sparkes>quarterly report, you report up your boss,
talk to their boss, and then it gets down.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/345-2
01:08:31.716 --> 01:08:35.310
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there a direct relationship or do you
think you can do to so? Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/345-3
01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:38.753
<v Josh Sparkes>there's debriefs that we'll do so ahead
of the deal is one of them.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/345-4
01:08:38.753 --> 01:08:41.638
<v Josh Sparkes>Where that was one of the ones that the
team we've done,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/345-5
01:08:41.638 --> 01:08:43.511
<v Josh Sparkes>Brisbane is having a debrief session.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/346-0
01:08:43.591 --> 01:08:48.151
<v Josh Sparkes>With the corporate team because they
already recognised that that wasn't</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/346-1
01:08:48.151 --> 01:08:52.836
<v Josh Sparkes>effective way of working. So yeah,
there there is that connection with the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/346-2
01:08:52.836 --> 01:08:56.209
<v Josh Sparkes>stakeholders,
the CNG that's working with the partner</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/346-3
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:59.270
<v Josh Sparkes>groups.
But also I'll reflect that and quarterly</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/346-4
01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:01.831
<v Josh Sparkes>reporting that does go to all leadership.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/347-0
01:09:02.231 --> 01:09:05.633
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's two methods.
It seems very apologies,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/347-1
01:09:05.633 --> 01:09:10.978
<v Josh Sparkes>it seems very retrospective rather than
the quarterly important one is both.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/347-2
01:09:10.978 --> 01:09:14.935
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's like we,
we're just adding a new section this</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/347-3
01:09:14.935 --> 01:09:17.711
<v Josh Sparkes>quarter around like how can you help us?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/348-0
01:09:17.951 --> 01:09:22.431
<v Josh Sparkes>Which is exactly that scenario that's
going in at the 1st of November of giving</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/348-1
01:09:22.431 --> 01:09:26.463
<v Josh Sparkes>us that early notification. Yes,
there's an opportunity that as soon as</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/348-2
01:09:26.463 --> 01:09:29.935
<v Josh Sparkes>they know, you know,
I mean that's probably what we're trying</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/348-3
01:09:29.935 --> 01:09:33.631
<v Josh Sparkes>to get to and stakeholder conversations
as well like I have them.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/349-0
01:09:34.151 --> 01:09:38.267
<v Josh Sparkes>Throughout, so throughout the month,
so it's more about bringing those to life</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/349-1
01:09:38.267 --> 01:09:42.018
<v Josh Sparkes>with examples of like this is something
that we do need and it has been</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/349-2
01:09:42.018 --> 01:09:46.342
<v Josh Sparkes>addressing more of an awareness piece for
that particular area as well as it being</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/349-3
01:09:46.342 --> 01:09:50.614
<v Josh Sparkes>in reports and documented because they're
the legal teams that are working on it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/349-4
01:09:50.614 --> 01:09:53.271
<v Josh Sparkes>Do they get asked to work on?
I mean there's this.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/350-0
01:09:53.831 --> 01:09:56.543
<v Josh Sparkes>Them to work on it. I mean,
they're good partner.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/350-1
01:09:56.543 --> 01:10:00.176
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what I'm saying.
So there's an initial partner instruction.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/350-2
01:10:00.176 --> 01:10:04.188
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're sending something that you
could then be part of that partner.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/350-3
01:10:04.188 --> 01:10:07.822
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know how they raise it.
They're going to just e-mail them.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/350-4
01:10:07.822 --> 01:10:09.231
<v Josh Sparkes>But it could be that they.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/351-0
01:10:09.551 --> 01:10:13.093
<v Josh Sparkes>On behalf of the P,
there is a A form already. You know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/351-1
01:10:13.093 --> 01:10:17.877
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just saying that you get told at
exactly the same time as the legal team</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/351-2
01:10:17.877 --> 01:10:22.724
<v Josh Sparkes>which we're trying to investigate that.
But is that verbal to their 10s or to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/351-3
01:10:22.724 --> 01:10:26.390
<v Josh Sparkes>their e-mail? Or could they? I don't know.
That is asking.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/351-4
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:28.191
<v Josh Sparkes>That's something that may be.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/352-0
01:10:28.471 --> 01:10:32.443
<v Josh Sparkes>Through service,
now that you both get told at the same</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/352-1
01:10:32.443 --> 01:10:35.705
<v Josh Sparkes>time,
I mean in the sense that the legal team</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/352-2
01:10:35.705 --> 01:10:40.740
<v Josh Sparkes>would get not on service now,
but they get an e-mail and you would get</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/352-3
01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:43.151
<v Josh Sparkes>a ticket. I mean that's something.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/353-0
01:10:43.951 --> 01:10:47.814
<v Josh Sparkes>That a change of behaviour that when the
PE is informing them you also get</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/353-1
01:10:47.814 --> 01:10:50.544
<v Josh Sparkes>involved, you yes,
I think that would work for early</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/353-2
01:10:50.544 --> 01:10:53.222
<v Josh Sparkes>notification.
We don't work directly with the legal</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/353-3
01:10:53.222 --> 01:10:57.291
<v Josh Sparkes>teams unless there's a set up that where
we do maybe work with expertise where</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/353-4
01:10:57.291 --> 01:11:00.742
<v Josh Sparkes>they've not got a nomination.
It's early notification. That's yes,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/353-5
01:11:00.742 --> 01:11:03.111
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that would work,
but it's about also.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/354-0
01:11:03.151 --> 01:11:07.759
<v Josh Sparkes>So incorporating CMG into that as well.
So it's not just us and the legal teams</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/354-1
01:11:07.759 --> 01:11:10.294
<v Josh Sparkes>that's incorporating CMG into that as
well.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/354-2
01:11:10.294 --> 01:11:13.462
<v Josh Sparkes>And that initial request to trigger
partner on the PE,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/354-3
01:11:13.462 --> 01:11:16.975
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe on behalf of that,
when she informs the legal team CMG</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/354-4
01:11:16.975 --> 01:11:18.991
<v Josh Sparkes>involved in you're you're informed.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/356-0
01:11:19.591 --> 01:11:22.498
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah,
all all parties effectively are talking</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/356-1
01:11:22.498 --> 01:11:24.751
<v Josh Sparkes>to each other, but through the system.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/357-0
01:11:26.031 --> 01:11:31.258
<v Josh Sparkes>I just think the only the only thing I'm
thinking in my head is it probably starts</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/357-1
01:11:31.258 --> 01:11:36.421
<v Josh Sparkes>in a place where they're not going to try
to think this through, articulate this.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/357-2
01:11:36.421 --> 01:11:41.584
<v Josh Sparkes>It's probably not even go to service now
to raise a request because they're not a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/357-3
01:11:41.584 --> 01:11:42.591
<v Josh Sparkes>functional team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/358-0
01:11:44.111 --> 01:11:48.884
<v Josh Sparkes>They would just send an e-mail,
but we don't know who they send that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/358-1
01:11:48.884 --> 01:11:52.689
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail to 1st.
There's it could be like all the people</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/358-2
01:11:52.689 --> 01:11:56.839
<v Josh Sparkes>that will not be using ServiceNow as
their mean place tool.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/358-3
01:11:56.839 --> 01:12:02.511
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be how we get a trigger to then
trigger a new ServiceNow for these guys.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/359-0
01:12:02.711 --> 01:12:06.719
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know how that would work.
That's where the connection.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/359-1
01:12:06.719 --> 01:12:10.027
<v Josh Sparkes>That's where the connection of CMG comes
in for us,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/359-2
01:12:10.027 --> 01:12:14.543
<v Josh Sparkes>for our notification and the purpose of
calendar is the partner group.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/359-3
01:12:14.543 --> 01:12:17.406
<v Josh Sparkes>Legal teams instruct CMG and it's for,
yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/359-4
01:12:17.406 --> 01:12:22.431
<v Josh Sparkes>but they're not also always looked in
because of the relationship, which then.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/360-0
01:12:22.631 --> 01:12:27.271
<v Josh Sparkes>Has an impact on us and where they do
have their relationship,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/360-1
01:12:27.271 --> 01:12:32.500
<v Josh Sparkes>it works really well. We can,
we can take that as a parking lot of how</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/360-2
01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:37.065
<v Josh Sparkes>that initial. Yeah. Yeah,
I totally get the point that you're</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/360-3
01:12:37.065 --> 01:12:40.379
<v Josh Sparkes>making.
I just don't quite understand how we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/360-4
01:12:40.379 --> 01:12:41.631
<v Josh Sparkes>change that here.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/361-0
01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:46.377
<v Josh Sparkes>These are, you know,
I mean throughout the whole of last week,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/361-1
01:12:46.377 --> 01:12:49.898
<v Josh Sparkes>they seem to be the ones that were on the,
you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/361-2
01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:54.150
<v Josh Sparkes>tripling lots of emails that they might
be used. It will be PE.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/361-3
01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:57.471
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's not on behalf of a partner or fee
earner.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/362-0
01:12:59.551 --> 01:13:02.220
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So your P ES in this instance would be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/362-1
01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:05.719
<v Josh Sparkes>your expertise lawyers,
but that's their expertise of law.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/362-2
01:13:05.719 --> 01:13:10.345
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're they're then seen as the
effectively the P ES the PS and where the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/362-3
01:13:10.345 --> 01:13:14.200
<v Josh Sparkes>admin behind the partner group,
whereas the partners instruction</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/362-4
01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:14.911
<v Josh Sparkes>instructing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/363-0
01:13:15.311 --> 01:13:18.214
<v Josh Sparkes>The associates, the senior associates,
the trainees,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/363-1
01:13:18.214 --> 01:13:22.539
<v Josh Sparkes>the expertise lawyers that need to work
on that particular article to draught,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/363-2
01:13:22.539 --> 01:13:26.537
<v Josh Sparkes>go through the revisions, they sign off.
Proofreading CMG, get involved.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/363-3
01:13:26.537 --> 01:13:29.548
<v Josh Sparkes>Then we get involved. Published. OK.
It's as you said,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/363-4
01:13:29.548 --> 01:13:32.231
<v Josh Sparkes>it's probably more we can public it,
but change.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/364-0
01:13:32.551 --> 01:13:36.082
<v Josh Sparkes>Far, yeah,
everybody still have that challenge. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/364-1
01:13:36.082 --> 01:13:39.939
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's. Yeah. A waiter. Yeah.
You'll always have that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/364-2
01:13:39.939 --> 01:13:44.254
<v Josh Sparkes>Heads up challenge. Probably. Yeah.
It's better than it has been.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/364-3
01:13:44.254 --> 01:13:48.111
<v Josh Sparkes>It's going in the right direction.
Is it perfect by norms?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/365-0
01:13:50.871 --> 01:13:55.012
<v Josh Sparkes>So this is comes into you.
We can you can go to enrich it further.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/365-1
01:13:55.012 --> 01:13:59.833
<v Josh Sparkes>So when you go in you've received it,
they're all the fields that they had to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/365-2
01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:04.283
<v Josh Sparkes>complete is there further information
that you then say actually it's a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/365-3
01:14:04.283 --> 01:14:08.671
<v Josh Sparkes>priority one priority two or you just
start to you start to assign it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/366-0
01:14:08.751 --> 01:14:13.571
<v Josh Sparkes>As to who's going to be working on what,
so if you take only the 28th today,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/366-1
01:14:13.571 --> 01:14:16.451
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean yesterday you had quite
interestingly,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/366-2
01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:20.394
<v Josh Sparkes>that there was one done one whip on one,
you know outstanding.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/366-3
01:14:20.394 --> 01:14:24.338
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's actually let me take that what
happens in that case.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/366-4
01:14:24.338 --> 01:14:28.031
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've got two from yesterday that's
still not complete.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/367-0
01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:33.115
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're probably still the one that's
in progress is probably going through the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/367-1
01:14:33.115 --> 01:14:37.038
<v Josh Sparkes>revision process that we spoke about of
redrafting for that one, you can't.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/367-2
01:14:37.038 --> 01:14:40.857
<v Josh Sparkes>So if I was to click on it now,
would you be able to get that information</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/367-3
01:14:40.857 --> 01:14:44.831
<v Josh Sparkes>that where exactly where it is in the
process other than from the colour no.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/368-0
01:14:45.431 --> 01:14:48.221
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, OK,
so we could that's not we have it on our</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/368-1
01:14:48.221 --> 01:14:52.434
<v Josh Sparkes>site and was that on so that would just
be in journals and share well OK,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/368-2
01:14:52.434 --> 01:14:56.875
<v Josh Sparkes>so in show you would actually says a
duplication that you would actually then</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/368-3
01:14:56.875 --> 01:15:01.031
<v Josh Sparkes>you could see post reference that one go
and show and see where it's at.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/369-0
01:15:01.431 --> 01:15:04.399
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Where it is in the process, yeah.
OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/369-1
01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:07.907
<v Josh Sparkes>And if I was to go and Cheryl and pick up
that one,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/369-2
01:15:07.907 --> 01:15:13.371
<v Josh Sparkes>it would you would be able to see maybe
it's in revision awaiting information or</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/369-3
01:15:13.371 --> 01:15:17.958
<v Josh Sparkes>is that all captured on notes.
So that information is there because</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/369-4
01:15:17.958 --> 01:15:20.791
<v Josh Sparkes>they've started the work it's potentially.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/370-0
01:15:20.871 --> 01:15:24.311
<v Josh Sparkes>Awaiting a QC or there's a revision that
then requires a further QC.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/371-0
01:15:25.951 --> 01:15:32.342
<v Josh Sparkes>Quality check. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yeah.
So we can capture each of those steps.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/371-1
01:15:32.342 --> 01:15:36.378
<v Josh Sparkes>You say?
So it's a work in progress and then it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/371-2
01:15:36.378 --> 01:15:41.003
<v Josh Sparkes>goes potentially.
So does each one then have to have a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/371-3
01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:41.591
<v Josh Sparkes>review.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/372-0
01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:47.407
<v Josh Sparkes>Then accuse the quality check and then
complete. So what's the end quality check?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/372-1
01:15:47.407 --> 01:15:51.593
<v Josh Sparkes>So once it's been drafted,
so we've got all the content we've</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/372-2
01:15:51.593 --> 01:15:56.859
<v Josh Sparkes>drafted it on the website and internal
quality cheques completed and then the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/372-3
01:15:56.859 --> 01:15:57.871
<v Josh Sparkes>link is shared.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/373-0
01:15:58.311 --> 01:16:04.264
<v Josh Sparkes>With the CMG and leading teams over their
final sign off, so work in progress,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/373-1
01:16:04.264 --> 01:16:08.483
<v Josh Sparkes>then it will be in draught as it were.
Quality cheques,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/373-2
01:16:08.483 --> 01:16:14.511
<v Josh Sparkes>link providers and then close, complete,
published close complete. Is that how?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/374-0
01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:20.291
<v Josh Sparkes>It goes, I mean, not to, you know,
have a workflow that says every single</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/374-1
01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:23.465
<v Josh Sparkes>step,
but they can be checklist checklist in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/374-2
01:16:23.465 --> 01:16:27.203
<v Josh Sparkes>there that is in draught on hold awaiting
revisions.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/374-3
01:16:27.203 --> 01:16:29.671
<v Josh Sparkes>It's actually been quality checked.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/375-0
01:16:29.991 --> 01:16:34.651
<v Josh Sparkes>And then I doesn't sound like you have a
live check between or peer review between</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/375-1
01:16:34.651 --> 01:16:38.412
<v Josh Sparkes>you and the team. Does that happen?
Magistrate live check and all.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/375-2
01:16:38.412 --> 01:16:42.622
<v Josh Sparkes>All of these single one. Yes. OK.
And in we talked about live cheques last</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/375-3
01:16:42.622 --> 01:16:46.664
<v Josh Sparkes>week where you can actually say live
cheques. So it's assigned to it's,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/375-4
01:16:46.664 --> 01:16:49.751
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, you don't have to,
you know appear on there.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/376-0
01:16:50.391 --> 01:16:53.352
<v Josh Sparkes>But it could be over the shoulder.
Is it more like an over the shoulder?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/376-1
01:16:53.352 --> 01:16:56.638
<v Josh Sparkes>They've looked at it or do they come out
of it and look and go through the whole</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/376-2
01:16:56.638 --> 01:16:59.071
<v Josh Sparkes>thing within teams?
You can always talk more about quality.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/377-0
01:17:01.071 --> 01:17:05.733
<v Josh Sparkes>So basically,
for publications we run quality check</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/377-1
01:17:05.733 --> 01:17:12.994
<v Josh Sparkes>like a complete from end to end process
to check the content and all the tagging</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/377-2
01:17:12.994 --> 01:17:16.311
<v Josh Sparkes>all the links if they are working so.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/378-0
01:17:16.951 --> 01:17:22.496
<v Josh Sparkes>It's sell them to do over the shoulder
because usually, yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/378-1
01:17:22.496 --> 01:17:29.739
<v Josh Sparkes>but there's too much details and yeah.
So basically one of the team members will</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/378-2
01:17:29.739 --> 01:17:32.511
<v Josh Sparkes>be assigned to to do the check.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/379-0
01:17:32.911 --> 01:17:37.760
<v Josh Sparkes>And report all the discrepancies and
asked to be revised before sending the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/379-1
01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:41.843
<v Josh Sparkes>preview link to the request.
And can anybody in the we have the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/379-2
01:17:41.843 --> 01:17:46.755
<v Josh Sparkes>checklist anybody in your team do that?
So it doesn't have to be an approval</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/379-3
01:17:46.755 --> 01:17:50.136
<v Josh Sparkes>level or manager level.
Where do live cheques go to?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/379-4
01:17:50.136 --> 01:17:52.751
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's mostly the more experienced.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/380-0
01:17:52.831 --> 01:17:57.738
<v Josh Sparkes>This members do the check that skills
matrix that we could have in the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/380-1
01:17:57.738 --> 01:18:03.543
<v Josh Sparkes>background when you also you know you can
assign to to the IT could populate who it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/380-2
01:18:03.543 --> 01:18:06.929
<v Josh Sparkes>goes to.
So it's in their queue a subset of your</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/380-3
01:18:06.929 --> 01:18:09.071
<v Josh Sparkes>team can you know capture that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/381-0
01:18:09.511 --> 01:18:11.463
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So this is one of the quality cheques</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/381-1
01:18:11.463 --> 01:18:13.992
<v Josh Sparkes>that we've talked about before with the
checklist in it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/381-2
01:18:13.992 --> 01:18:16.033
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll use an approval workflow to do
that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/381-3
01:18:16.033 --> 01:18:18.695
<v Josh Sparkes>So you just obviously do it in teams
outside at the moment,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/381-4
01:18:18.695 --> 01:18:21.445
<v Josh Sparkes>but we can do it in the system personally
completes the work,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/381-5
01:18:21.445 --> 01:18:24.151
<v Josh Sparkes>can assign it to whoever's going to be
checking it for them.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/382-0
01:18:24.671 --> 01:18:29.279
<v Josh Sparkes>And as Deborah said that we can use the
skills matrix behind that to auto assign</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/382-1
01:18:29.279 --> 01:18:33.773
<v Josh Sparkes>them based on skills and capacity and
then they can complete the checklist and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/382-2
01:18:33.773 --> 01:18:36.389
<v Josh Sparkes>send it back really work and stuff like
that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/382-3
01:18:36.389 --> 01:18:40.599
<v Josh Sparkes>So it just does it in the system rather
than and you can catch my waiting</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/382-4
01:18:40.599 --> 01:18:42.191
<v Josh Sparkes>approval waiting live check.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/383-0
01:18:42.991 --> 01:18:47.731
<v Josh Sparkes>And eventually marking your own homework
so that you're not live checking your own</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/383-1
01:18:47.731 --> 01:18:51.956
<v Josh Sparkes>work effectively, and what happens?
But it captures that that that's been</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/383-2
01:18:51.956 --> 01:18:56.011
<v Josh Sparkes>done and then moves on to the.
So after that live check it then is the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/383-3
01:18:56.011 --> 01:18:59.151
<v Josh Sparkes>links are done,
the content's done the tagging's done.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/384-0
01:18:59.511 --> 01:19:04.424
<v Josh Sparkes>And then it's ready for publication.
Can I just check can we go back to that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/384-1
01:19:04.424 --> 01:19:09.144
<v Josh Sparkes>or sign on the policy check in C4?
Is that automatically when you move to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/384-2
01:19:09.144 --> 01:19:12.525
<v Josh Sparkes>that state,
the system triggers this person based on</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/384-3
01:19:12.525 --> 01:19:17.629
<v Josh Sparkes>that skills matrix is available to do
that quality check or is it a case of the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/384-4
01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:19.351
<v Josh Sparkes>team have had a discussion?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/385-0
01:19:19.431 --> 01:19:23.969
<v Josh Sparkes>To see who is available to work on that
QC to then assign it to that person.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/385-1
01:19:23.969 --> 01:19:27.741
<v Josh Sparkes>You can do it either way.
I mean it could be that you saved the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/385-2
01:19:27.741 --> 01:19:32.043
<v Josh Sparkes>bits on, but those three of you,
so you've got skill and capacity. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/385-3
01:19:32.043 --> 01:19:36.817
<v Josh Sparkes>that that's probably the biggest piece
here for as a first market or it could be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/385-4
01:19:36.817 --> 01:19:37.111
<v Josh Sparkes>that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/386-0
01:19:37.871 --> 01:19:41.842
<v Josh Sparkes>You might want to say you know it.
It's when you move on to that state,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/386-1
01:19:41.842 --> 01:19:45.703
<v Josh Sparkes>the group, the three people,
it's a group captured and then you might</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/386-2
01:19:45.703 --> 01:19:48.681
<v Josh Sparkes>want to select the name or you can let
the system do.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/386-3
01:19:48.681 --> 01:19:51.218
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the group and based on scaling
capacity,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/386-4
01:19:51.218 --> 01:19:55.410
<v Josh Sparkes>so you're already in skill because you've
got your subset of the, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/386-5
01:19:55.410 --> 01:19:56.071
<v Josh Sparkes>individuals.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/387-0
01:19:56.471 --> 01:19:58.864
<v Josh Sparkes>And then based on capacity,
it's different.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/387-1
01:19:58.864 --> 01:20:02.127
<v Josh Sparkes>You can reassign if to another person,
even if that person,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/387-2
01:20:02.127 --> 01:20:05.227
<v Josh Sparkes>even if it's been sensible and they've
got the capacity,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/387-3
01:20:05.227 --> 01:20:09.143
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be that they say, oh,
can I reassign it to someone else within</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/387-4
01:20:09.143 --> 01:20:11.917
<v Josh Sparkes>that subset?
So it could be both ways really these</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/387-5
01:20:11.917 --> 01:20:13.711
<v Josh Sparkes>auto assignment and giving it to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/388-0
01:20:14.431 --> 01:20:18.775
<v Josh Sparkes>A person just stage to that SLA,
you know when it's busy or you might be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/388-1
01:20:18.775 --> 01:20:23.356
<v Josh Sparkes>working at home and you're not all in the
office. So it could be either way.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/388-2
01:20:23.356 --> 01:20:27.878
<v Josh Sparkes>You could just sort of go scenario one.
It goes to the subset group and you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/388-3
01:20:27.878 --> 01:20:32.043
<v Josh Sparkes>select the person or it goes to the
subset group and a defined person</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/388-4
01:20:32.043 --> 01:20:33.471
<v Josh Sparkes>automatically and where.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/389-0
01:20:34.671 --> 01:20:36.631
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's fine and where you have.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/390-0
01:20:38.791 --> 01:20:43.517
<v Josh Sparkes>The assignment where Maggie's been
assigned to do the check is that notified</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/390-1
01:20:43.517 --> 01:20:47.137
<v Josh Sparkes>to the stakeholder is that no
notifications then sent out.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/390-2
01:20:47.137 --> 01:20:52.108
<v Josh Sparkes>That's internal to your, to your group.
Yeah. OK, so it's not notifying. No, no,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/390-3
01:20:52.108 --> 01:20:54.747
<v Josh Sparkes>no,
because you're just going through your</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/390-4
01:20:54.747 --> 01:20:58.551
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow as a as clients, you know,
that's what you're doing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/391-0
01:20:58.631 --> 01:21:01.806
<v Josh Sparkes>Within your workflow,
sounds like you don't want to notify them</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/391-1
01:21:01.806 --> 01:21:05.030
<v Josh Sparkes>no, at least to my emails.
For this on the best it could be that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/391-2
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:08.700
<v Josh Sparkes>they see the original request to seize
where it is in the workflow. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/391-3
01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:12.271
<v Josh Sparkes>but then that's be notified of every time
you're doing something. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/391-4
01:21:12.271 --> 01:21:15.495
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think for me the from a operational
team, yes, that's fine.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/391-5
01:21:15.495 --> 01:21:18.471
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the autonomy for the team to be
able to reallocate.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/392-0
01:21:19.031 --> 01:21:22.082
<v Josh Sparkes>It's quite important based on where they
have a gap,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/392-1
01:21:22.082 --> 01:21:25.421
<v Josh Sparkes>but also where we have articles that are
first to market.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/392-2
01:21:25.421 --> 01:21:30.142
<v Josh Sparkes>We need people available to pick up AQC
that the team will discuss and teams like</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/392-3
01:21:30.142 --> 01:21:34.114
<v Josh Sparkes>who's available for aqc this one needs to
go urgently. I need Mandy,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/392-4
01:21:34.114 --> 01:21:38.431
<v Josh Sparkes>who's waiting on information coming back.
The system is not going to know.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/394-0
01:21:38.511 --> 01:21:41.093
<v Josh Sparkes>That necessarily it's more that Mandy can
go,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/394-1
01:21:41.093 --> 01:21:45.750
<v Josh Sparkes>I can take that and they can just assign
it to Mandy in order for the QC to happen</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/394-2
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:49.679
<v Josh Sparkes>urgently and deliver on time.
So I think that's one aspect and for me</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/394-3
01:21:49.679 --> 01:21:53.831
<v Josh Sparkes>obviously is the communications for
stakeholders that they don't receive.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/395-0
01:21:54.391 --> 01:21:57.885
<v Josh Sparkes>Numerous notifications because it reduced
get lost in a sea of notifications.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/395-1
01:21:57.885 --> 01:22:00.707
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh yeah. And then yeah,
So what they want to know probably is,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/395-2
01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:03.036
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
the first thing will be where is it every</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/395-3
01:22:03.036 --> 01:22:06.171
<v Josh Sparkes>time they get something back it will be.
And so when am I getting it?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/395-4
01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:09.351
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean that's their that's probably their
ultimate question, isn't it?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/396-0
01:22:09.831 --> 01:22:13.570
<v Josh Sparkes>Just don't tell me every step.
I just want to know when it's done and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/396-1
01:22:13.570 --> 01:22:17.683
<v Josh Sparkes>that's just just on that allocation.
So it's better to think of it for phase</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/396-2
01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:21.155
<v Josh Sparkes>one is like a proposal you can absolutely
go in and reassign it,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/396-3
01:22:21.155 --> 01:22:25.534
<v Josh Sparkes>but we would probably want to build it so
that as you go forward with things like</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/396-4
01:22:25.534 --> 01:22:28.151
<v Josh Sparkes>capacity and everything else become more
mature.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/397-0
01:22:28.791 --> 01:22:33.471
<v Josh Sparkes>You can trust that auto assignment piece.
You can always reassign to say you know</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/397-1
01:22:33.471 --> 01:22:36.325
<v Josh Sparkes>there's,
there's always the opportunity to go and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/397-2
01:22:36.325 --> 01:22:40.320
<v Josh Sparkes>move it to to somebody else.
But you know only ever go to some set of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/397-3
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.517
<v Josh Sparkes>a group. Yeah.
I think for me it's that fear of like it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/397-4
01:22:43.517 --> 01:22:47.911
<v Josh Sparkes>goes to the team leader being Claudia,
who's sitting in a meeting like that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/398-0
01:22:47.991 --> 01:22:51.394
<v Josh Sparkes>Calendar like where?
It doesn't say that Claudia is in a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/398-1
01:22:51.394 --> 01:22:55.036
<v Josh Sparkes>meeting, for example,
because she's the team leader and then</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/398-2
01:22:55.036 --> 01:22:59.274
<v Josh Sparkes>that's been assigned to Claudia,
who's not sat in front of her laptop.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/398-3
01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:03.214
<v Josh Sparkes>I was like from my side,
that's the concern of if it goes to that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/398-4
01:23:03.214 --> 01:23:07.631
<v Josh Sparkes>group because Claudia has got that
experience of being able to say QC or.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/399-0
01:23:07.751 --> 01:23:11.675
<v Josh Sparkes>Mandy. But does it talk to the calendar?
That's saying that actually,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/399-1
01:23:11.675 --> 01:23:15.878
<v Josh Sparkes>Mandy's out well in the 1st place,
as you said probably for your trust and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/399-2
01:23:15.878 --> 01:23:19.466
<v Josh Sparkes>confidence in the system.
It can just be assigned to the group,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/399-3
01:23:19.466 --> 01:23:22.212
<v Josh Sparkes>the subset group, you know,
quality Check Group,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/399-4
01:23:22.212 --> 01:23:26.191
<v Josh Sparkes>which is a subset and you can assign the
person. And as you grow that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/400-0
01:23:26.711 --> 01:23:30.636
<v Josh Sparkes>Scale and capacity and it looks like
who's available or not available.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/400-1
01:23:30.636 --> 01:23:32.791
<v Josh Sparkes>Then it can also assign later on, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/404-0
01:23:33.511 --> 01:23:37.650
<v Mark Sedge>It's also worth saying that the members
of the group themselves can select their</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/404-1
01:23:37.650 --> 01:23:40.817
<v Mark Sedge>own tickets, right?
So if they see something in the group and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/401-0
01:23:37.671 --> 01:23:37.791
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/404-2
01:23:40.817 --> 01:23:44.138
<v Mark Sedge>go, that's it. You know,
I can I can best support that they can.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/402-0
01:23:40.911 --> 01:23:41.031
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/403-0
01:23:43.431 --> 01:23:43.551
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/404-3
01:23:44.138 --> 01:23:47.102
<v Mark Sedge>They can assign it to themselves and
start working on it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/404-4
01:23:47.102 --> 01:23:50.831
<v Mark Sedge>So there's that freedom as well. You know,
through that group structure.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/405-0
01:23:52.471 --> 01:23:56.751
<v Josh Sparkes>It will be on your dashboard,
but these were waiting. Yeah. Awaiting.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/405-1
01:23:56.751 --> 01:24:00.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Please. Sorry, John. Sorry,
I don't know what to listen to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/405-2
01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:04.089
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just going to say it'll be a
challenge for all of us.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/405-3
01:24:04.089 --> 01:24:07.818
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't have a calendar that won't be
able to link that to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/405-4
01:24:07.818 --> 01:24:09.591
<v Josh Sparkes>That could be something that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/406-0
01:24:09.631 --> 01:24:13.204
<v Josh Sparkes>It'll happen in the future,
but it won't happen for day one.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/406-1
01:24:13.204 --> 01:24:18.064
<v Josh Sparkes>From the notification perspective, again,
we'll need to the what notifications get</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/406-2
01:24:18.064 --> 01:24:20.641
<v Josh Sparkes>sent,
so if we think about our stakeholders</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/406-3
01:24:20.641 --> 01:24:24.623
<v Josh Sparkes>etcetera are using the portal.
So if they're sitting in the portal,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/406-4
01:24:24.623 --> 01:24:29.016
<v Josh Sparkes>things will show for them, right?
We'll get numbers to see you've got task</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/406-5
01:24:29.016 --> 01:24:29.191
<v Josh Sparkes>or.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/407-0
01:24:29.311 --> 01:24:32.860
<v Josh Sparkes>Notification or whatever,
but we can also e-mail them because we'll</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/407-1
01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:36.826
<v Josh Sparkes>have stakeholder groups that won't be
sitting in ServiceNow like us, right?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/407-2
01:24:36.826 --> 01:24:40.792
<v Josh Sparkes>But we just need to take the at what
stage that is that won't be throughout</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/407-3
01:24:40.792 --> 01:24:43.296
<v Josh Sparkes>the whole movement.
If they went to the portal,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/407-4
01:24:43.296 --> 01:24:46.062
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll see where it's sitting at each
stage in there.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/407-5
01:24:46.062 --> 01:24:48.671
<v Josh Sparkes>But we don't need to necessarily notify
them all.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/408-0
01:24:49.471 --> 01:24:53.310
<v Josh Sparkes>We might notify them only on the clause.
Yeah, only when receipt, right.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/408-1
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:56.624
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's something that from an ***
perspective, would leave.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/408-2
01:24:56.624 --> 01:25:00.042
<v Josh Sparkes>What that looks like? Yeah,
I think the nervousness for me comes</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/408-3
01:25:00.042 --> 01:25:02.829
<v Josh Sparkes>around where we were QC.
And then based on a system,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/408-4
01:25:02.829 --> 01:25:05.143
<v Josh Sparkes>when a stakeholder comes back to me to
say,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/408-5
01:25:05.143 --> 01:25:08.351
<v Josh Sparkes>why was that not delivered on time when
it sat with Claudia?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/409-0
01:25:08.471 --> 01:25:12.462
<v Josh Sparkes>Based on the system automation that was
then. So that's. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/409-1
01:25:12.462 --> 01:25:17.213
<v Josh Sparkes>she she's my team leader. Sorry. Yeah.
So there's like Claudia, of course.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/409-2
01:25:17.213 --> 01:25:21.774
<v Josh Sparkes>The the team leaders or like,
coordinators and specialists that are the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/409-3
01:25:21.774 --> 01:25:23.231
<v Josh Sparkes>ones that are Q seeing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/410-0
01:25:23.671 --> 01:25:28.100
<v Josh Sparkes>But they're more likely to potentially be
in a workshop or be on a project that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/410-1
01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:31.200
<v Josh Sparkes>involves taking them away from the
day-to-day. You see,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/410-2
01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.466
<v Josh Sparkes>it's always in clients that they're a
subset of your team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/410-3
01:25:34.466 --> 01:25:38.175
<v Josh Sparkes>They're not outside of. Yeah.
So it's all an ask client. OK. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/410-4
01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:41.054
<v Josh Sparkes>you could.
It sounds like initially you can just go</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/410-5
01:25:41.054 --> 01:25:42.991
<v Josh Sparkes>on the dashboard. This is awaiting.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/411-0
01:25:43.151 --> 01:25:43.591
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you say?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/412-0
01:25:44.031 --> 01:25:47.397
<v Josh Sparkes>And you can also assign based on the
availability just for that trust</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/412-1
01:25:47.397 --> 01:25:50.666
<v Josh Sparkes>initially as the first phase.
I don't want it to backfire because I</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/412-2
01:25:50.666 --> 01:25:53.022
<v Josh Sparkes>could see very easily back happening on
my team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/412-3
01:25:53.022 --> 01:25:56.820
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think what's important here is there
will be lots of testing done, right.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/412-4
01:25:56.820 --> 01:26:00.763
<v Josh Sparkes>So this isn't something that we're going
to walk away from here just now and then</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/412-5
01:26:00.763 --> 01:26:03.551
<v Josh Sparkes>make your decision.
And it's also something that we need.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/413-0
01:26:03.631 --> 01:26:07.391
<v Josh Sparkes>To consider an enterprise level because
IT will need to do the same sort of stuff,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/413-1
01:26:07.391 --> 01:26:09.521
<v Josh Sparkes>we need to set the system up in a certain
way.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/413-2
01:26:09.521 --> 01:26:12.284
<v Josh Sparkes>These are all valid things that have been
brought up before,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/413-3
01:26:12.284 --> 01:26:14.685
<v Josh Sparkes>like it's not anything that none of us
are aware of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/413-4
01:26:14.685 --> 01:26:18.309
<v Josh Sparkes>It's something that we'll work through
and naturally understand where that auto</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/413-5
01:26:18.309 --> 01:26:19.351
<v Josh Sparkes>assignment piece works.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/414-0
01:26:19.871 --> 01:26:23.742
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's something that we should try and
achieve both from as tickets come in,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/414-1
01:26:23.742 --> 01:26:27.709
<v Josh Sparkes>we should be able to assign them based on
the scales matrix that we have based on</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/414-2
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:29.837
<v Josh Sparkes>how we can measure capacity and the
system,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/414-3
01:26:29.837 --> 01:26:32.643
<v Josh Sparkes>but also your quality cheques and all
that kind of stuff.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/414-4
01:26:32.643 --> 01:26:35.208
<v Josh Sparkes>So we should be thinking about that where
we get to,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/414-5
01:26:35.208 --> 01:26:38.981
<v Josh Sparkes>we're just going to need a trial. Yeah,
I think that's the journey, isn't it,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/414-6
01:26:38.981 --> 01:26:39.271
<v Josh Sparkes>right.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/415-0
01:26:39.391 --> 01:26:39.791
<v Josh Sparkes>It's my.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/416-0
01:26:39.871 --> 01:26:43.041
<v Josh Sparkes>And I think for me,
like we're from this team and what we're</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/416-1
01:26:43.041 --> 01:26:46.160
<v Josh Sparkes>comfortable with,
I would say like Team Auto assign because</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/416-2
01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:50.109
<v Josh Sparkes>of from a stakeholder perspective,
from from change the expectation of when</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/416-3
01:26:50.109 --> 01:26:53.279
<v Josh Sparkes>a person's assigned as they know that
they're working on it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/416-4
01:26:53.279 --> 01:26:57.021
<v Josh Sparkes>If I have a notification that goes out to
the stakeholder group to say,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/416-5
01:26:57.021 --> 01:26:59.671
<v Josh Sparkes>Andy's now working on that case and I go
actually.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/417-0
01:26:59.831 --> 01:27:03.615
<v Josh Sparkes>In that hour,
I'd be assigned it to the next year. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/417-1
01:27:03.615 --> 01:27:07.200
<v Josh Sparkes>they will just be.
They won't be of that information.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/417-2
01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:10.719
<v Josh Sparkes>So don't worry.
They're not going to be triggered in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/417-3
01:27:10.719 --> 01:27:15.631
<v Josh Sparkes>fires of is there a reason that they
won't know who do they need to know?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/418-0
01:27:16.311 --> 01:27:18.866
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So they'll generally pick up with the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/418-1
01:27:18.866 --> 01:27:23.394
<v Josh Sparkes>individual, whether that be on teams,
a call as the original requester. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/418-2
01:27:23.394 --> 01:27:26.703
<v Josh Sparkes>we'd want to know who.
So that's the team is packing up.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/418-3
01:27:26.703 --> 01:27:31.463
<v Josh Sparkes>What we're trying to change a little bit
is how we meet those communications when</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/418-4
01:27:31.463 --> 01:27:34.830
<v Josh Sparkes>we're updating information.
That's what the portal's for.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/418-5
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:35.991
<v Josh Sparkes>So they can go into.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/419-0
01:27:36.151 --> 01:27:39.430
<v Josh Sparkes>Portal and see the case.
It may have the name against it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/419-1
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:43.670
<v Josh Sparkes>We haven't actually read that yet,
right about what that looks like in the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/419-2
01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:46.327
<v Josh Sparkes>portal,
but they will be communicating through</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/419-3
01:27:46.327 --> 01:27:50.850
<v Josh Sparkes>that case or the questions that come up
rather than going or just teams. Mandy,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/419-4
01:27:50.850 --> 01:27:53.676
<v Josh Sparkes>if we get a question to ask,
it's so much easier.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/419-5
01:27:53.676 --> 01:27:55.711
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not like saying that an e-mail.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/420-0
01:27:55.871 --> 01:27:59.720
<v Josh Sparkes>Was in an e-mail box and has to go
through a case and all that kind of thing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/420-1
01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.928
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just in front of you like a chat.
Yeah, I've got it on the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/420-2
01:28:02.928 --> 01:28:06.925
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's about this message for us.
I've got it on the screen. Jill, chat.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/420-3
01:28:06.925 --> 01:28:10.626
<v Josh Sparkes>Right. So it's kind of like teams.
You've got an action to be able to chat</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/420-4
01:28:10.626 --> 01:28:11.711
<v Josh Sparkes>backwards and forward.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/421-0
01:28:12.071 --> 01:28:15.355
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's on a case rather than thinking
about chatting.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/421-1
01:28:15.355 --> 01:28:19.811
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's not like as in a view of what
the stakeholder would say is like if</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/421-2
01:28:19.811 --> 01:28:24.561
<v Josh Sparkes>that's ask client. So it's not Mandy,
it's ask client is communicating with you,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/421-3
01:28:24.561 --> 01:28:27.551
<v Josh Sparkes>you'll see the name.
So I've got it on the screen.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/423-0
01:28:28.711 --> 01:28:33.782
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can see the name. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Sorry. It's been submitted essentially.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/422-0
01:28:29.711 --> 01:28:33.011
<v Mark Sedge>Can you share Josh,
can you share your screen mate just the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/422-1
01:28:33.011 --> 01:28:33.671
<v Mark Sedge>way. Thanks.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/423-1
01:28:33.782 --> 01:28:37.586
<v Josh Sparkes>It sounds like this is an area that,
you know, as you said,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/423-2
01:28:37.586 --> 01:28:42.213
<v Josh Sparkes>it's probably quite sensitive.
So you can move it along the workflow and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/423-3
01:28:42.213 --> 01:28:46.841
<v Josh Sparkes>the stakeholder can see that it's moved
from work in progress or waiting</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/423-4
01:28:46.841 --> 01:28:47.791
<v Josh Sparkes>information or.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/424-0
01:28:47.911 --> 01:28:50.989
<v Josh Sparkes>Now in QC,
in that quality check and then we get</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/424-1
01:28:50.989 --> 01:28:54.758
<v Josh Sparkes>that information.
Is that whether you need them to have the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/424-2
01:28:54.758 --> 01:28:57.710
<v Josh Sparkes>state as well as the person working on it
now?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/424-3
01:28:57.710 --> 01:29:02.798
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably I would say as a resistance that
you're trying to put trust back in and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/424-4
01:29:02.798 --> 01:29:04.431
<v Josh Sparkes>that it's being worked on.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/425-0
01:29:04.951 --> 01:29:08.721
<v Josh Sparkes>Rather than contact that in having that
name and then saying,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/425-1
01:29:08.721 --> 01:29:12.856
<v Josh Sparkes>where is it what you need,
what you know it's avoiding further arms</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/425-2
01:29:12.856 --> 01:29:17.416
<v Josh Sparkes>and legs communication in another
platform on teams and and having service</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/425-3
01:29:17.416 --> 01:29:22.342
<v Josh Sparkes>now as a single point of entry to trust
that it's being worked on or communicate</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/425-4
01:29:22.342 --> 01:29:24.591
<v Josh Sparkes>with you. We can have notes in there.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/426-0
01:29:25.071 --> 01:29:28.936
<v Josh Sparkes>But then coming out the system calling,
you emailing your team's view,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/426-1
01:29:28.936 --> 01:29:32.311
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just how you would like to manage
that. Now if you have,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/426-2
01:29:32.311 --> 01:29:35.468
<v Josh Sparkes>if you want them to have a named
individual, that's fine,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/426-3
01:29:35.468 --> 01:29:39.387
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's you also have the challenges why
you want them to have a name.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/426-4
01:29:39.387 --> 01:29:43.578
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it so that they can badger them?
So it would be it would be that contact.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/426-5
01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:44.231
<v Josh Sparkes>So a lot of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/428-0
01:29:44.311 --> 01:29:48.554
<v Josh Sparkes>What I get is like who's going to be
working on it and who can I contact?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/427-0
01:29:47.551 --> 01:29:47.671
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/428-1

behaviour of the firm and they want that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/428-2
01:29:52.912 --> 01:29:57.614
<v Josh Sparkes>to they want to push it along that I need
that or that I need to communicate that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/428-3
01:29:57.614 --> 01:30:00.194
<v Josh Sparkes>out.
It's more about it's a change piece for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/428-4
01:30:00.194 --> 01:30:01.111
<v Josh Sparkes>the firm around.</v>

01:30:01.471 --> 01:30:04.493
<v Josh Sparkes>The legal teams,
the behaviours of those teams,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/429-1
01:30:04.493 --> 01:30:09.656
<v Josh Sparkes>CMG just needing a person to work on it
and a lot of the feedback is it was great</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/429-2
01:30:09.656 --> 01:30:14.377
<v Josh Sparkes>to just have Sam or Mandy on that
particular case that worked through that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/429-3
01:30:14.377 --> 01:30:18.595
<v Josh Sparkes>from start to end. Great.
But it's about that named individual and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/429-4
01:30:18.595 --> 01:30:19.791
<v Josh Sparkes>being able to pass.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/436-0
01:30:18.831 --> 01:30:21.920
<v Mark Sedge>So one of the things so if it helps
operationally,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/430-0
01:30:21.151 --> 01:30:21.871
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorting art.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/436-1
01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:26.705
<v Mark Sedge>one of the things your teams can do,
so as soon as they get an assigned ticket</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/431-0
01:30:24.831 --> 01:30:24.951
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/436-2
01:30:26.705 --> 01:30:31.429
<v Mark Sedge>as Josh was showing you the angle here
for where customers can interface into</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/432-0
01:30:28.091 --> 01:30:28.211
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/436-3
01:30:31.429 --> 01:30:34.337
<v Mark Sedge>the record,
the users can also from the record,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/436-4
01:30:34.337 --> 01:30:38.031
<v Mark Sedge>the agents from the record can do it the
other way. So they.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/433-0
01:30:34.351 --> 01:30:34.471
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/434-0
01:30:38.111 --> 01:30:38.231
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/441-0
01:30:38.271 --> 01:30:41.769
<v Mark Sedge>Do a customer comms or note in the record
say HI.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/435-0
01:30:39.271 --> 01:30:39.391
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/437-0
01:30:40.471 --> 01:30:40.591
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/441-1
01:30:41.769 --> 01:30:47.226
<v Mark Sedge>I'm working on your case etc and then
that will appear automatically on here.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/441-2
01:30:47.226 --> 01:30:51.773
<v Mark Sedge>So there's some steps operation you can
do to open the dialogue,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/439-0
01:30:51.471 --> 01:30:51.591
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/441-3
01:30:51.773 --> 01:30:53.871
<v Mark Sedge>engage via the mechanism here.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/440-0
01:30:52.671 --> 01:30:52.791
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/444-0
01:30:54.351 --> 01:30:59.293
<v Mark Sedge>That opens the door for this is the route
in because then what you get in the notes</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/442-0
01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:57.071
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/444-1
01:30:59.293 --> 01:31:03.294
<v Mark Sedge>structure of the actual record itself is
all of the communications.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/443-0
01:31:02.151 --> 01:31:02.271

01:31:03.294 --> 01:31:07.412
<v Mark Sedge>The reason that's quite important is
because if you you can have some</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/444-3
01:31:07.412 --> 01:31:08.471

01:31:40.631 --> 01:31:45.665
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe I can ask you what do they do with
that information today so that you you've</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/454-1
01:31:45.665 --> 01:31:49.909

What what's their first step that they do</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/454-2
01:31:49.909 --> 01:31:54.579
<v Josh Sparkes>knowing that piece of information,
the first thing is when is it going to be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/454-3
01:31:54.579 --> 01:31:59.551
<v Josh Sparkes>done is it is it badgering or is there a
reason why is there more back and forth?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/455-0
01:32:00.951 --> 01:32:04.296
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes,
sometimes they what they put on the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/455-1
01:32:04.296 --> 01:32:09.491
<v Josh Sparkes>request is like I have a task I wanted
you to to to do something for me.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/455-2
01:32:09.491 --> 01:32:14.401
<v Josh Sparkes>But I'm I can't share the details right
now, so I'll share whatever.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/455-3
01:32:14.401 --> 01:32:19.951
<v Josh Sparkes>Whoever to what, whoever is picking it up.
This is the QC. This is the check.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/456-0
01:32:20.351 --> 01:32:24.622
<v Josh Sparkes>We're talking about no,
the initial initial request that put in,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/456-1
01:32:24.622 --> 01:32:30.076
<v Josh Sparkes>so sometimes they just put in like I have
like a PowerPoint formatting task that I</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/456-2
01:32:30.076 --> 01:32:34.872
<v Josh Sparkes>need you to you guys to help me,
but I don't have the details right now.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/456-3
01:32:34.872 --> 01:32:39.471
<v Josh Sparkes>So I will share whatever the information
to whoever is picking it up.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/457-0
01:32:39.831 --> 01:32:44.447
<v Josh Sparkes>So once like for somebody,
if I pick this case up and they know that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/457-1
01:32:44.447 --> 01:32:48.461
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm working on it,
they will share the information directly</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/457-2
01:32:48.461 --> 01:32:52.007
<v Josh Sparkes>with me, yeah,
via e-mail or via phone call or teams</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/457-3
01:32:52.007 --> 01:32:55.418
<v Josh Sparkes>message.
And sometimes because we have been, like,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/457-4
01:32:55.418 --> 01:32:59.231
<v Josh Sparkes>working with the team for so long.
So they kind of like.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/458-0
01:32:59.511 --> 01:33:03.209
<v Josh Sparkes>Knows what our individuals,
the status or working behaviour.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/458-1
01:33:03.209 --> 01:33:06.725
<v Josh Sparkes>So for example,
they know that I'm I can turn around some</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/458-2
01:33:06.725 --> 01:33:11.878
<v Josh Sparkes>cases very quickly, get used to you being,
you know, I can go around the back. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/458-3
01:33:11.878 --> 01:33:16.485
<v Josh Sparkes>So for example. Yeah. So for example,
if they know that I'm picking this up</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/458-4
01:33:16.485 --> 01:33:19.031
<v Josh Sparkes>there okay many things can turn it around.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/459-0
01:33:19.111 --> 01:33:23.388
<v Josh Sparkes>In like 2 hours for for example,
if there's a junior members,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/459-1
01:33:23.388 --> 01:33:28.699
<v Josh Sparkes>they will probably take more time,
need more time to turn it around with the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/459-2
01:33:28.699 --> 01:33:32.286
<v Josh Sparkes>same case.
So sometimes they will have that kind of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/459-3
01:33:32.286 --> 01:33:35.321
<v Josh Sparkes>preference. Yeah,
two things going on here.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/459-4
01:33:35.321 --> 01:33:38.631
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes the communication is positive,
right?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/460-0
01:33:38.831 --> 01:33:43.227
<v Josh Sparkes>From your stakeholders because they
appreciate what work that you do.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/460-1
01:33:43.227 --> 01:33:46.178
<v Josh Sparkes>Other times the communication is not
positive.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/460-2
01:33:46.178 --> 01:33:49.945
<v Josh Sparkes>So what we're trying to do is strike a
balance here, right?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/460-3
01:33:49.945 --> 01:33:55.031
<v Josh Sparkes>What we want to remove or not necessarily
remove, but what we want to impact is.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/462-0
01:33:55.271 --> 01:34:00.290
<v Josh Sparkes>That negative side of that communication
coming from all angles and actually being</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/462-1
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:05.128
<v Josh Sparkes>able to have a view of that communication
so that we can then start to have the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/462-2
01:34:05.128 --> 01:34:08.998
<v Josh Sparkes>conversation around what communication is
helpful and positive,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/462-3
01:34:08.998 --> 01:34:13.351
<v Josh Sparkes>what communication is actually hindering
this providing our job, right.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/461-0
01:34:10.871 --> 01:34:11.231
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/463-0
01:34:13.831 --> 01:34:18.112
<v Josh Sparkes>That is what this will do,
and nobody is underestimating the change</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/463-1
01:34:18.112 --> 01:34:21.701
<v Josh Sparkes>for your stakeholders that that will have
here. However,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/463-2
01:34:21.701 --> 01:34:26.360
<v Josh Sparkes>it is a massive benefit that we will be
plugging from this whole project,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/463-3
01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:31.397
<v Josh Sparkes>right and that's the approach that we
need to start thinking about is how we as</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/463-4
01:34:31.397 --> 01:34:31.711
<v Josh Sparkes>well.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/464-0
01:34:32.191 --> 01:34:36.449
<v Josh Sparkes>Recognise that behaviour and find
opportunities in the system to be able to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/464-1
01:34:36.449 --> 01:34:40.931
<v Josh Sparkes>streamline it through there the forms and
stuff that we're using will help that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/464-2
01:34:40.931 --> 01:34:44.797
<v Josh Sparkes>initial information going in.
Then the communication can go forward,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/464-3
01:34:44.797 --> 01:34:48.270
<v Josh Sparkes>your name will be on it.
We won't be a faceless organisation,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/464-4
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:51.631
<v Josh Sparkes>but what we need to start working with
the stakeholders as.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/465-0
01:34:51.671 --> 01:34:54.195
<v Josh Sparkes>So around educating them on communicate
through here,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/465-1
01:34:54.195 --> 01:34:56.764
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll get back to you really quickly.
It will be there,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/465-2
01:34:56.764 --> 01:34:58.867
<v Josh Sparkes>it will pop up on my dashboard.
I'll see it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/465-3
01:34:58.867 --> 01:35:02.231
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got a really good service by
communicating with us through this.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/466-0
01:35:03.591 --> 01:35:07.452
<v Mark Sedge>Jill, there's there's another advantage,
of course that you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/467-0
01:35:04.111 --> 01:35:10.533
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry, mark. One minute. Sorry. Look,
I think I think sorry, Mark. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/466-1
01:35:07.452 --> 01:35:10.551
<v Mark Sedge>to the point that if if you've got a user
community.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/467-1
01:35:10.533 --> 01:35:17.746
<v Josh Sparkes>I think my reservation is there because
of how because they're not going to be in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/467-2
01:35:17.746 --> 01:35:21.880
<v Josh Sparkes>service now.
So they're not going to be in the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/467-3
01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.551
<v Josh Sparkes>dashboard. So we'll</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/468-0
01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:25.471
<v Josh Sparkes>and put that message so.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/469-0
01:35:27.351 --> 01:35:29.576
<v Josh Sparkes>So all the requests,
maybe if you just yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/469-1
01:35:29.576 --> 01:35:33.433
<v Josh Sparkes>if you say that you're so they they've
requested it and they now they want to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/469-2
01:35:33.433 --> 01:35:36.449
<v Josh Sparkes>know without updating.
Yeah so that that communication we're</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/469-3
01:35:36.449 --> 01:35:40.256
<v Josh Sparkes>just shifting the communication from
teams to service house so that's not an</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/469-4
01:35:40.256 --> 01:35:44.063
<v Josh Sparkes>issue it's just more about how's that
then notified the stakeholder group do</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/469-5
01:35:44.063 --> 01:35:46.831
<v Josh Sparkes>they need to be sitting in a platform
waiting for that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/470-0
01:35:46.911 --> 01:35:51.024
<v Josh Sparkes>Communication in relation to that case,
like how is that brought up to the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/470-1
01:35:51.024 --> 01:35:55.630
<v Josh Sparkes>stakeholder with Mandy's sent a message.
Is that an e-mail that pings to them? Say,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/470-2
01:35:55.630 --> 01:35:58.755
<v Josh Sparkes>Mandy sent you a message.
You need to look here or like,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/470-3
01:35:58.755 --> 01:36:01.551
<v Josh Sparkes>how does that work from a stakeholder
perspective?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/471-0
01:36:03.071 --> 01:36:05.690
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a waiter part of the change piece,
right?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/471-1
01:36:05.690 --> 01:36:09.913
<v Josh Sparkes>So the decisions around that at that
level and so we don't know yet because we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/471-2
01:36:09.913 --> 01:36:13.868
<v Josh Sparkes>need to understand what notifications and
when we're going to be sending.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/471-3
01:36:13.868 --> 01:36:17.022
<v Josh Sparkes>And by notifications,
I don't mean messaging through this.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/471-4
01:36:17.022 --> 01:36:21.351
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean you'll be sending an additional
e-mail to point them back into ServiceNow</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/471-5
01:36:21.351 --> 01:36:21.511
<v Josh Sparkes>to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/472-0
01:36:21.791 --> 01:36:25.202
<v Josh Sparkes>For those messages,
it's really critical about where we do</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/472-1
01:36:25.202 --> 01:36:29.537
<v Josh Sparkes>that and if there's actually a need for
this to do that. Because actually,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/472-2
01:36:29.537 --> 01:36:32.254
<v Josh Sparkes>if we do their job really well through
change,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/472-3
01:36:32.254 --> 01:36:36.878
<v Josh Sparkes>people will understand that that is the
place to go to get those communications</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/472-4
01:36:36.878 --> 01:36:41.271
<v Josh Sparkes>and start to get used to that. Sorry,
I know you're glad to ask a question.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/473-0
01:36:41.311 --> 01:36:41.831
<v Josh Sparkes>Question but.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/474-0
01:36:41.871 --> 01:36:44.725
<v Josh Sparkes>To Mandy's point,
we need to stamp out this behaviour of,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/474-1
01:36:44.725 --> 01:36:48.268
<v Josh Sparkes>oh, if Mandy's working on it.
I know I can get in two hours if somebody</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/474-2
01:36:48.268 --> 01:36:51.172
<v Josh Sparkes>else is working on it,
they back off and give you 4 hours.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/474-3
01:36:51.172 --> 01:36:55.207
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we need to be if you. Obviously,
if you deliver before your SLA. Amazing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/474-4
01:36:55.207 --> 01:36:57.716
<v Josh Sparkes>But I think we need to stop that, like,
behaviour.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/474-5
01:36:57.716 --> 01:37:01.062
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a constant level of service.
It's a constant level of service.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/474-6
01:37:01.062 --> 01:37:01.751
<v Josh Sparkes>So as long as.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/477-0
01:37:01.871 --> 01:37:04.599
<v Josh Sparkes>You're hitting your SLA,
I think even Mandy, like,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/477-1
01:37:04.599 --> 01:37:07.754
<v Josh Sparkes>didn't respond until like obviously till
they do that. No,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/477-2
01:37:07.754 --> 01:37:11.230
<v Josh Sparkes>they don't send it deliver quicker.
Obviously I'm not saying go,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/475-0
01:37:10.671 --> 01:37:12.311
<v Mark Sedge>But but this was the point.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/477-3
01:37:11.230 --> 01:37:14.439
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's that consistency.
They shouldn't be changing their</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/477-4
01:37:14.439 --> 01:37:18.183
<v Josh Sparkes>behaviour. Oh, if it's Mandy.
I know I get into if it's someone else,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/477-5
01:37:18.183 --> 01:37:21.391
<v Josh Sparkes>what's not calling that right is Mandy
does encourage them.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/476-0
01:37:19.711 --> 01:37:19.791
<v Mark Sedge>It.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/479-0
01:37:21.951 --> 01:37:25.092
<v Josh Sparkes>Go through the portal or get signed to
the most. I'm sure she does,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/479-1
01:37:25.092 --> 01:37:28.140
<v Josh Sparkes>but I just think it's their shift of
behaviour. Confidence. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/478-0
01:37:27.871 --> 01:37:28.231
<v Mark Sedge>Boot.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/479-2
01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:31.788
<v Josh Sparkes>and I think the largest change is going
to be on the stakeholder group and how</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/479-3
01:37:31.788 --> 01:37:35.160
<v Josh Sparkes>they work with the team because I think
we are very open to all of that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/479-4
01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:38.993
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just my nervousness comes when it's
from a stakeholder perspective and what I</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/479-5
01:37:38.993 --> 01:37:41.671
<v Josh Sparkes>know about the stakeholder group and how
they will react.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/480-0
01:37:42.351 --> 01:37:45.326
<v Josh Sparkes>The notification.
So I was going to say what Mark's going</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/480-1
01:37:45.326 --> 01:37:47.685
<v Josh Sparkes>to say,
which is what you permit you promote,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/480-2
01:37:47.685 --> 01:37:48.351
<v Josh Sparkes>not like him.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/481-0
01:37:47.991 --> 01:37:48.551
<v Mark Sedge>Yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/482-0
01:37:50.471 --> 01:37:53.351
<v Josh Sparkes>How do you want to interject?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/484-0
01:37:53.031 --> 01:37:56.604
<v Mark Sedge>Well, it was two things.
It was going exactly where Ruth ended up</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/484-1
01:37:56.604 --> 01:38:00.609
<v Mark Sedge>saying what you permit your pro.
This is about us really trying to derive</v>

01:38:00.609 --> 01:38:04.668
<v Mark Sedge>the right behaviours from the customer
community for the best outcome from</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/484-3
01:38:04.668 --> 01:38:07.158
<v Mark Sedge>Ashurst. Overall,
that's the important thing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/484-4
01:38:07.158 --> 01:38:08.511
<v Mark Sedge>The second thing is that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/483-0
01:38:08.191 --> 01:38:08.311
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/487-0
01:38:09.551 --> 01:38:11.593
<v Mark Sedge>By,
by the very nature of having the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/485-0
01:38:10.511 --> 01:38:10.631
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/487-1
01:38:11.593 --> 01:38:14.682
<v Mark Sedge>communications than the data, etcetera,
etcetera. What?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/487-2
01:38:14.682 --> 01:38:18.710
<v Mark Sedge>What do you start to be able to do is get
the levelling across the team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/486-0
01:38:17.031 --> 01:38:17.151
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/487-3
01:38:18.710 --> 01:38:22.572
<v Mark Sedge>So it's not just Mandy being the star
deliverer that everybody wants,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/487-4
01:38:22.572 --> 01:38:25.331
<v Mark Sedge>that actually the teams look at how they
operate.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/487-5
01:38:25.331 --> 01:38:28.751
<v Mark Sedge>Look at the performance and you bring
everybody up such that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/489-0
01:38:28.871 --> 01:38:33.219
<v Mark Sedge>You can deliver that consistent view.
It's not necessarily pulling a person</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/488-0
01:38:31.471 --> 01:38:31.711
<v Josh Sparkes>1.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/489-1
01:38:33.219 --> 01:38:35.907
<v Mark Sedge>back,
it's lifting the erformance right across</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/489-2
01:38:35.907 --> 01:38:40.483
<v Mark Sedge>your operation and then driving the right
behaviour because you're delivering a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/489-3
01:38:40.483 --> 01:38:45.288
<v Mark Sedge>consistent output that the customers will
get better service by going the preferred</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/489-4
01:38:45.288 --> 01:38:45.631
<v Mark Sedge>route.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/491-0
01:38:45.951 --> 01:38:49.131
<v Mark Sedge>Then if they go,
you know the you know the suboptimal</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/490-0
01:38:49.111 --> 01:38:49.231
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/491-1
01:38:49.131 --> 01:38:50.191
<v Mark Sedge>route if you like.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/492-0
01:38:51.311 --> 01:38:54.838
<v Josh Sparkes>I completely understand that mark,
that I'm on the same page as you.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/492-1
01:38:54.838 --> 01:38:57.393
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's.
I would be doing my job if I wasn't</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/492-2
01:38:57.393 --> 01:39:01.583
<v Josh Sparkes>raising the concerns that I already know
from the stakeholder group of where that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/492-3
01:39:01.583 --> 01:39:05.774
<v Josh Sparkes>implicates change and the behaviours are
all going to be faced when we make those</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/492-4
01:39:05.774 --> 01:39:07.511
<v Josh Sparkes>changes. Can I just hope so? Just.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/493-0
01:39:08.111 --> 01:39:10.751
<v Josh Sparkes>Rollbacks, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/495-0
01:39:08.391 --> 01:39:12.685
<v Mark Sedge>And you're not alone. Sorry. Just sorry,
Deborah. You're not alone.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/495-1
01:39:12.685 --> 01:39:16.599
<v Mark Sedge>Every session we've had,
pretty much it comes through the the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/495-2
01:39:16.599 --> 01:39:20.703
<v Mark Sedge>trigger point that says yes,
but we've got an audience or a user</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/495-3
01:39:20.703 --> 01:39:24.681
<v Mark Sedge>community or, you know,
partner community who don't want to do</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/494-0
01:39:22.591 --> 01:39:22.711
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/495-4
01:39:24.681 --> 01:39:27.711
<v Mark Sedge>this.
So there's a massive ask around that and.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/497-0
01:39:27.791 --> 01:39:31.351
<v Mark Sedge>It's going to have to be top down to
support you to exactly your point.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/496-0
01:39:29.591 --> 01:39:29.711
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/498-0
01:39:32.991 --> 01:39:36.622
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry, it's also phased,
so we're not going to expect that we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/498-1
01:39:36.622 --> 01:39:40.897
<v Josh Sparkes>behave the way we want on day one,
but we can phase it in and say right,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/498-2
01:39:40.897 --> 01:39:43.708
<v Josh Sparkes>let's aim for this and let's aim,
I don't know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/498-3
01:39:43.708 --> 01:39:47.808
<v Josh Sparkes>40% of all communications are through
service now through the portal,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/498-4
01:39:47.808 --> 01:39:50.911
<v Josh Sparkes>nobody goes and pounds Mandy or Leanne or
any other.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/499-0
01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:55.042
<v Josh Sparkes>I'd be quite sorry one of your
coordinators or team leads,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/499-1
01:39:55.042 --> 01:39:59.461
<v Josh Sparkes>but let's aim for 40% and then the next
quarter of the aim for 50,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/499-2
01:39:59.461 --> 01:40:03.747
<v Josh Sparkes>we can graduate and then you phase out
the bad behaviours. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/499-3
01:40:03.747 --> 01:40:07.176
<v Josh Sparkes>I was going to say actually you're not
alone. Also,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/499-4
01:40:07.176 --> 01:40:10.671
<v Josh Sparkes>as soon as you touch touched upon
assignment groups.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/500-0
01:40:11.271 --> 01:40:15.431
<v Josh Sparkes>There is a reservation of gosh,
how's that going to, you know what,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/500-1
01:40:15.431 --> 01:40:19.530
<v Josh Sparkes>what's the impact? So again,
but I think I probably just wanted to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/500-2
01:40:19.530 --> 01:40:22.467
<v Josh Sparkes>touch points of your stakeholder
notifications.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/500-3
01:40:22.467 --> 01:40:26.871
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that a few times you got the
request that plus the stakeholder.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/501-0
01:40:27.431 --> 01:40:30.680
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that captured so when you get that
initial request,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/501-1
01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:33.456
<v Josh Sparkes>do you know who's it the ultimate
stakeholder?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/501-2
01:40:33.456 --> 01:40:37.532
<v Josh Sparkes>Because I think that's probably,
since instead of just informing the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/501-3
01:40:37.532 --> 01:40:41.017
<v Josh Sparkes>request or closely,
you want to also know they brace it on</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/501-4
01:40:41.017 --> 01:40:45.151
<v Josh Sparkes>behalf of or what's that model? Yeah.
So they can do it on behalf of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/502-0
01:40:45.551 --> 01:40:48.464
<v Josh Sparkes>Right, as well as like,
so the lawyer is working on it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/502-1
01:40:48.464 --> 01:40:51.793
<v Josh Sparkes>Somebody might have made the request that
this is what we want.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/502-2
01:40:51.793 --> 01:40:55.746
<v Josh Sparkes>But there are another audience that you
also need to inform when it's done.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/502-3
01:40:55.746 --> 01:40:59.439
<v Josh Sparkes>It would still go with the requester.
So the request is the one that's</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/502-4
01:40:59.439 --> 01:41:00.791
<v Josh Sparkes>responsible for notifying.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/503-0
01:41:01.311 --> 01:41:05.550
<v Josh Sparkes>The one they're acting behalf of. OK,
so I didn't know whether you wanted to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/503-1
01:41:05.550 --> 01:41:09.679
<v Josh Sparkes>capture a subset that the requestor gets
and these get OK because you said</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/503-2
01:41:09.679 --> 01:41:13.588
<v Josh Sparkes>stakeholder, but it's actually called.
It could put the language back.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/503-3
01:41:13.588 --> 01:41:17.111
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the requester. Is that correct? Yeah.
So, OK. OK. Perfect.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/504-0
01:41:20.471 --> 01:41:22.151
<v Josh Sparkes>Can I just finish off that work?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/505-0
01:41:23.831 --> 01:41:30.257
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry, so I'm just writing on that point.
Of course the the primary contact point</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/505-1
01:41:30.257 --> 01:41:35.115
<v Josh Sparkes>for us is always the request, OK,
but because for now all the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/505-2
01:41:35.115 --> 01:41:39.111
<v Josh Sparkes>correspondence that we sent out by a
shareware is.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/506-0
01:41:39.311 --> 01:41:43.843
<v Josh Sparkes>In an e-mail format,
so sometimes the requester would put in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/506-1
01:41:43.843 --> 01:41:48.523
<v Josh Sparkes>the other other fees,
owner or partners in CC so that whenever</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/506-2
01:41:48.523 --> 01:41:51.866
<v Josh Sparkes>we reply to to a case they all these
people,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/506-3
01:41:51.866 --> 01:41:57.809
<v Josh Sparkes>all these optimal stakeholders will also
get the that I was it was only plural,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/506-4
01:41:57.809 --> 01:41:59.071
<v Josh Sparkes>not just request.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/508-0
01:41:59.551 --> 01:42:02.472
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm wondering at the at the forum at
the beginning,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/508-1
01:42:02.472 --> 01:42:06.084
<v Josh Sparkes>other people notified because
particularly you've got some of those</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/508-2
01:42:06.084 --> 01:42:09.749
<v Josh Sparkes>activities that are in a month,
you know you're going into November.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/508-3
01:42:09.749 --> 01:42:13.891
<v Josh Sparkes>This person might be away or a day off
that they get notified and then others</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/508-4
01:42:13.891 --> 01:42:16.972
<v Josh Sparkes>don't get notified.
So there could be an opportunity that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/508-5
01:42:16.972 --> 01:42:18.671
<v Josh Sparkes>other stakeholders are notified.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/509-0
01:42:19.031 --> 01:42:23.362
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's probably a selection that
they need to make the start of who needs</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/509-1
01:42:23.362 --> 01:42:27.368
<v Josh Sparkes>to be informed because not every category
is going to have the same level</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/509-2
01:42:27.368 --> 01:42:31.860
<v Josh Sparkes>engagement across all stakeholder groups,
and each ear works slightly differently.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/509-3
01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:35.325
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, we could do that.
So it's more about a selection for them</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/509-4
01:42:35.325 --> 01:42:38.031
<v Josh Sparkes>to decide at that point who needs to be
informed.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/510-0
01:42:38.871 --> 01:42:43.658
<v Josh Sparkes>And it could be limited that they can't
put 50 people you know they can't put the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/510-1
01:42:43.658 --> 01:42:46.402
<v Josh Sparkes>world in.
They could just be a handful and you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/510-2
01:42:46.402 --> 01:42:50.488
<v Josh Sparkes>could structure it at levels, you know,
maybe it's partner, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/510-3
01:42:50.488 --> 01:42:55.391
<v Josh Sparkes>one from this group, one from this group,
one has got all three from three or four.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/510-4
01:42:55.391 --> 01:42:57.551
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Global content, calendar lists.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/511-0
01:42:58.671 --> 01:43:03.421
<v Josh Sparkes>Is going to be like your key contacts and
that we are likely they are going to be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/511-1
01:43:03.421 --> 01:43:07.071
<v Josh Sparkes>in the e-mail group,
so it should hopefully feed from there as</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/511-2
01:43:07.071 --> 01:43:09.620
<v Josh Sparkes>well so we can utilise that form,
OK can I,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/511-3
01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:14.022
<v Josh Sparkes>I know we're going to think about it.
You know this will be a good point to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/511-4
01:43:14.022 --> 01:43:17.671
<v Josh Sparkes>stop this probably.
I mean that's one process we've discussed.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/512-0
01:43:18.071 --> 01:43:22.512
<v Josh Sparkes>A lot. So we've got it hits yourself.
It's new work in progress.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/512-1
01:43:22.512 --> 01:43:27.705
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be in draught awaiting further
information, awaiting more updates.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/512-2
01:43:27.705 --> 01:43:32.487
<v Josh Sparkes>You might then come back another
iteration on hold, awaiting further.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/512-3
01:43:32.487 --> 01:43:36.791
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, it could have.
It could be cyclic in the sense that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/513-0
01:43:37.151 --> 01:43:41.047
<v Josh Sparkes>You're doing it and then when that's done,
it could be, as you said,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/513-1
01:43:41.047 --> 01:43:44.377
<v Josh Sparkes>in QC live cheques,
links content and then close complete.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/513-2
01:43:44.377 --> 01:43:48.837
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that sort of the path that I captured
that correctly is that the path or is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/513-3
01:43:48.837 --> 01:43:51.151
<v Josh Sparkes>there two more, more or less? But then I.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/514-0
01:43:52.791 --> 01:43:57.559
<v Josh Sparkes>But then I I just want to chat all these
stages that you just mentioned.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/514-1
01:43:57.559 --> 01:44:02.261
<v Josh Sparkes>Do we have to manually select or they
just go from one stage to another</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/514-2
01:44:02.261 --> 01:44:07.290
<v Josh Sparkes>automatically it just once it's done
completely just moves it on to the next</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/514-3
01:44:07.290 --> 01:44:10.098
<v Josh Sparkes>one.
So we have to like change it manually</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/514-4
01:44:10.098 --> 01:44:10.751
<v Josh Sparkes>from like.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/515-0
01:44:11.391 --> 01:44:16.370
<v Josh Sparkes>Draught completed or waiting for QC or
now waiting for additional information.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/515-1
01:44:16.370 --> 01:44:21.350
<v Josh Sparkes>Then we need to change the status. Well,
that in if there's loads of different</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/515-2
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:24.690
<v Josh Sparkes>things on hold,
or it could just be a check box that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/515-3
01:44:24.690 --> 01:44:28.598
<v Josh Sparkes>you're just checking it.
You don't physically have to move it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/515-4
01:44:28.598 --> 01:44:30.551
<v Josh Sparkes>along the workflow, but within.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/516-0
01:44:30.911 --> 01:44:33.689
<v Josh Sparkes>Work in progress.
It could be that rather than having work</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/516-1
01:44:33.689 --> 01:44:36.938
<v Josh Sparkes>those dates for each of these,
you just have a checkbox that it's on</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/516-2
01:44:36.938 --> 01:44:39.481
<v Josh Sparkes>hold or you're waiting for further
information. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/516-3
01:44:39.481 --> 01:44:43.389
<v Josh Sparkes>because and then when you completed that
it when all three check boxes are done or</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/516-4
01:44:43.389 --> 01:44:45.979
<v Josh Sparkes>wherever it is,
it just moves on to the next stage for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/516-5
01:44:45.979 --> 01:44:47.391
<v Josh Sparkes>you or if there's an approval.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/517-0
01:44:48.551 --> 01:44:53.648
<v Josh Sparkes>We even not like click the select,
click the begin work in on share.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/517-1
01:44:53.648 --> 01:44:57.341
<v Josh Sparkes>Well yeah,
that's the behaviour of team behaviour</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/517-2
01:44:57.341 --> 01:45:01.329
<v Josh Sparkes>that will need to be addressed on moving
cases along.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/517-3
01:45:01.329 --> 01:45:07.311
<v Josh Sparkes>Then if it's so at the minute we have
what begin work on hold pending completed.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/518-0
01:45:07.551 --> 01:45:12.358
<v Josh Sparkes>Just kind of high level and share.
I think we will from begin work jumped</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/518-1
01:45:12.358 --> 01:45:17.034
<v Josh Sparkes>and completed it was a manual click.
So it's extra effort for the team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/518-2
01:45:17.034 --> 01:45:21.970
<v Josh Sparkes>It's more about how do we make it easy
for the team to move through the the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/518-3
01:45:21.970 --> 01:45:26.907
<v Josh Sparkes>stages and the importance of that.
So that's more of a change piece for the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/518-4
01:45:26.907 --> 01:45:27.231
<v Josh Sparkes>team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/519-0
01:45:27.551 --> 01:45:30.830
<v Josh Sparkes>And how it informs things like reporting
our stakeholder view,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/519-1
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:34.057
<v Josh Sparkes>it impacts several areas.
Maybe it's not as complicated as in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/519-2
01:45:34.057 --> 01:45:37.856
<v Josh Sparkes>shareable. It's so much more. OK,
it's going to be the visibility again,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/519-3
01:45:37.856 --> 01:45:40.198
<v Josh Sparkes>but the behaviour piece is really
important.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/519-4
01:45:40.198 --> 01:45:44.154
<v Josh Sparkes>So we will need to change that behave
that you want to be able to move that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/519-5
01:45:44.154 --> 01:45:45.871
<v Josh Sparkes>through and make this successful.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/520-0
01:45:47.111 --> 01:45:49.682
<v Josh Sparkes>To be that,
any task takes longer to complete the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/520-1
01:45:49.682 --> 01:45:52.818
<v Josh Sparkes>form than it does actually work,
but you don't need version,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/520-2
01:45:52.818 --> 01:45:56.982
<v Josh Sparkes>but actually that's probably going back
to assignment groups so that it comes in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/520-3
01:45:56.982 --> 01:46:00.632
<v Josh Sparkes>to show when it's unassigned,
and then you assign it and at that point</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/520-4
01:46:00.632 --> 01:46:02.071
<v Josh Sparkes>it becomes work in progress.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/521-0
01:46:02.591 --> 01:46:07.066
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's where they need to collect again.
Work. So right now for the team to do it,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/521-1
01:46:07.066 --> 01:46:10.698
<v Josh Sparkes>they have to collect that.
So I think what what we're saying here is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/521-2
01:46:10.698 --> 01:46:14.803
<v Josh Sparkes>it's probably good to see it in service.
Now how that actually looks. I mean,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/521-3
01:46:14.803 --> 01:46:19.067
<v Josh Sparkes>if you're so it will be that as soon as
you know in the past when I've looked at</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/521-4
01:46:19.067 --> 01:46:21.751
<v Josh Sparkes>sort of semi field engineers out and they
have to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/522-0
01:46:21.831 --> 01:46:25.346
<v Josh Sparkes>To start their work,
it's been assigned to them as soon as</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/522-1
01:46:25.346 --> 01:46:29.456
<v Josh Sparkes>they sort of then say complete work,
or accept they accept the task.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/522-2
01:46:29.456 --> 01:46:34.281
<v Josh Sparkes>Almost that that's when the clock starts.
But it could be for your purposes that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/522-3
01:46:34.281 --> 01:46:38.450
<v Josh Sparkes>everything is new and you start work when
it's assigned to you. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/522-4
01:46:38.450 --> 01:46:41.071
<v Josh Sparkes>So that that's currently how we work,
yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/523-0
01:46:41.671 --> 01:46:46.515
<v Josh Sparkes>Or you're going to do auto assignment
based on skill matrix in phase two. Later,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/523-1
01:46:46.515 --> 01:46:50.521
<v Josh Sparkes>when you've got that trust in it,
you can say you know the clocks.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/523-2
01:46:50.521 --> 01:46:54.647
<v Josh Sparkes>You know I've I've accepted it and I'm
working on it. And the clock,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/523-3
01:46:54.647 --> 01:46:59.071
<v Josh Sparkes>even though you're not going in manually
doing lots of work, then you're.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/524-0
01:46:59.551 --> 01:47:04.231
<v Josh Sparkes>SLA starts from the point of acceptance
and you can start working on it by that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/524-1
01:47:04.231 --> 01:47:08.854
<v Josh Sparkes>It's it's very easy in service now and
once you've checked all your cheques you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/524-2
01:47:08.854 --> 01:47:13.302
<v Josh Sparkes>can then just also assign for the QC to
another person and move it along the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/524-3
01:47:13.302 --> 01:47:16.191
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow. Yeah,
I think it comes back to a change</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/524-4
01:47:16.191 --> 01:47:17.751
<v Josh Sparkes>behaviour for the team and.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/526-0
01:47:18.511 --> 01:47:23.606
<v Josh Sparkes>The purpose, the reason like yes,
why it's important and the reason why you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/525-0
01:47:21.271 --> 01:47:21.431
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/526-1
01:47:23.606 --> 01:47:29.103
<v Josh Sparkes>know sometimes you have to move it along
the workflow is because as you said it's</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/526-2
01:47:29.103 --> 01:47:34.131
<v Josh Sparkes>very much like new whip closed but you
want to get some insights into that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/526-3
01:47:34.131 --> 01:47:37.751
<v Josh Sparkes>behaviour that is actually gone on to QC
you know QC.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/527-0
01:47:38.031 --> 01:47:42.040
<v Josh Sparkes>Another person. When did they pick it up?
When did they complete it?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/527-1
01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:46.862
<v Josh Sparkes>You get lots of. Yeah. And of information.
And that's the team as well. Though of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/527-2
01:47:46.862 --> 01:47:51.568
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that going to come back on the team
though of when they moved it into that or</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/527-3
01:47:51.568 --> 01:47:53.311
<v Josh Sparkes>is that going to be triggered?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/528-0
01:47:53.551 --> 01:47:57.073
<v Josh Sparkes>By a system, as in,
we've done that part of the task that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/528-1
01:47:57.073 --> 01:48:00.958
<v Josh Sparkes>moves the case along.
Or is that relying on the team doing that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/528-2
01:48:00.958 --> 01:48:04.358
<v Josh Sparkes>because that,
again could potentially backfire? I mean,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/528-3
01:48:04.358 --> 01:48:08.911
<v Josh Sparkes>what point today does it move along?
What what do you, how do you trigger?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/529-0
01:48:09.311 --> 01:48:12.404
<v Josh Sparkes>That the person who's got to do QC,
that's enough.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/529-1
01:48:12.404 --> 01:48:17.134
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think the challenge is you do,
you're not going to be completing work in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/529-2
01:48:17.134 --> 01:48:20.772
<v Josh Sparkes>service now because you need to do it in
your other system.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/529-3
01:48:20.772 --> 01:48:25.988
<v Josh Sparkes>So you put stuff in PowerPoint, you do it.
Whatever other systems it is that you use,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/529-4
01:48:25.988 --> 01:48:26.351
<v Josh Sparkes>right?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/530-0
01:48:26.671 --> 01:48:29.150
<v Josh Sparkes>So had if that work all happened in
ServiceNow,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/530-1
01:48:29.150 --> 01:48:32.972
<v Josh Sparkes>it could do exactly what you're talking
about and automatically you would</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/530-2
01:48:32.972 --> 01:48:37.154
<v Josh Sparkes>automatically do that piece of work in
ServiceNow and it would change the status</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/530-3
01:48:37.154 --> 01:48:39.582
<v Josh Sparkes>of it.
But because the work's done outside the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/530-4
01:48:39.582 --> 01:48:43.351
<v Josh Sparkes>ServiceNow, we'll never get that right.
So there is going to need to be.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/531-0
01:48:44.191 --> 01:48:49.145
<v Josh Sparkes>And in element of moving those statuses
forward is not as clunky as in share.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/531-1
01:48:49.145 --> 01:48:52.193
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
I'm going to worry about it's going to be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/531-2
01:48:52.193 --> 01:48:56.893
<v Josh Sparkes>a behavioural change for the team,
but there's several reasons why we can</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/531-3
01:48:56.893 --> 01:49:01.529
<v Josh Sparkes>articulate that that's important.
It's also important from a stakeholder</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/531-4
01:49:01.529 --> 01:49:03.751
<v Josh Sparkes>perspective because they will have.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/532-0
01:49:03.871 --> 01:49:04.191
<v Josh Sparkes>You.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/533-0
01:49:04.311 --> 01:49:07.184
<v Josh Sparkes>And the employee centre of how that case
is moving forward.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/533-1
01:49:07.184 --> 01:49:10.152
<v Josh Sparkes>So as you move it in status,
it will change for them as well.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/533-2
01:49:10.152 --> 01:49:13.121
<v Josh Sparkes>That should stop your chasers or at least
reduce them, right?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/533-3
01:49:13.121 --> 01:49:16.472
<v Josh Sparkes>Because they'll be what you see. Oh,
they're currently working on it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/533-4
01:49:16.472 --> 01:49:19.919
<v Josh Sparkes>I can see it's moved forward, etcetera.
Oh, I'm expecting On this date.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/533-5
01:49:19.919 --> 01:49:23.031
<v Josh Sparkes>We're on track for that.
You know that type of stuff they'll be.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/534-0
01:49:24.311 --> 01:49:27.873
<v Josh Sparkes>More difficult for the team.
So I think from so easy to do, yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/534-1
01:49:27.873 --> 01:49:31.974
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean I I want to try and remove that
the element of this is going to be a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/534-2
01:49:31.974 --> 01:49:36.453
<v Josh Sparkes>labour intensive process that is actually
potentially going to be something that's</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/534-3
01:49:36.453 --> 01:49:39.960
<v Josh Sparkes>actually the backfires.
Can we maybe take an action that I think</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/534-4
01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:43.791
<v Josh Sparkes>this isn't the first time I've actually
heard this in these workshops?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/535-0
01:49:44.231 --> 01:49:48.175
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe we take an action that we give a
demo like a one O 1 of what the agent</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/535-1
01:49:48.175 --> 01:49:50.531
<v Josh Sparkes>workspace looks like.
How the workflow looks.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/535-2
01:49:50.531 --> 01:49:54.628
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's quite important for us to
be able to feed that back to the team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/535-3
01:49:54.628 --> 01:49:58.366
<v Josh Sparkes>Also back the workshops of like this is
this is going to be really good.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/535-4
01:49:58.366 --> 01:50:01.490
<v Josh Sparkes>This is going to be a lot easier and
we're able to track it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/535-5
01:50:01.490 --> 01:50:03.231
<v Josh Sparkes>I can sell that to the team I can.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/536-0
01:50:03.951 --> 01:50:08.585
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, in the experience it's easy,
but the main thing is that, yeah, I do.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/536-1
01:50:08.585 --> 01:50:11.636
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm like,
I don't understand you could you could do</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/536-2
01:50:11.636 --> 01:50:16.152
<v Josh Sparkes>in sense that it's great for bulk.
So you could have worked on a few and you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/536-3
01:50:16.152 --> 01:50:20.200
<v Josh Sparkes>want to bulk or just you know it's.
I'm rest assured it's very easy.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/536-4
01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:23.191
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not suddenly a button.
How do I move it long?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/537-0
01:50:23.591 --> 01:50:27.680
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a rest assured. That's it's. Yeah,
that's what ServiceNow process to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/537-1
01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:32.101
<v Josh Sparkes>shareholder basically forces the team to
to do the things that we need in order</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/537-2
01:50:32.101 --> 01:50:35.693
<v Josh Sparkes>for reporting. For example,
ServiceNow is a workflow management.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/537-3
01:50:35.693 --> 01:50:38.953
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, that's what it does. Yeah.
It can't move on. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/542-0
01:50:37.791 --> 01:50:40.804
<v Mark Sedge>So so to one of.
So if you want to automate,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/537-4
01:50:38.953 --> 01:50:40.831
<v Josh Sparkes>until completed all these aspects.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/542-1
01:50:40.804 --> 01:50:46.361
<v Mark Sedge>if you want to automate the state changes
then you can then you'd have to drive it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/538-0
01:50:42.071 --> 01:50:42.191
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/539-0
01:50:43.351 --> 01:50:43.471
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/542-2
01:50:46.361 --> 01:50:50.445
<v Mark Sedge>through a task, right?
So somebody gets a task they can when</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/540-0
01:50:50.071 --> 01:50:50.271
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/542-3
01:50:50.445 --> 01:50:54.529
<v Mark Sedge>they close the task,
it automatically changes the state kind</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/541-0
01:50:53.471 --> 01:50:55.071
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/542-4
01:50:54.529 --> 01:50:56.671
<v Mark Sedge>of thing. Now if to Jules Point.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/547-0
01:50:57.031 --> 01:51:01.440
<v Mark Sedge>If your task activity is being done
outside the tool, then all that means is.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/547-1
01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:05.227
<v Mark Sedge>If you get extra work because you have to
manage and close a task,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/547-2
01:51:05.227 --> 01:51:08.901
<v Mark Sedge>whereas what you'd actually want is when
they complete the task,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/547-3
01:51:08.901 --> 01:51:12.293
<v Mark Sedge>they just switch the state. It's a very,
you know it's one.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/544-0
01:51:11.551 --> 01:51:11.871
<v Josh Sparkes>It's me.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/547-4
01:51:12.293 --> 01:51:16.137
<v Mark Sedge>You can have it either way,
but it might be you actually do want to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/545-0
01:51:14.671 --> 01:51:14.791
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/547-5
01:51:16.137 --> 01:51:16.871
<v Mark Sedge>manage their.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/546-0
01:51:17.231 --> 01:51:17.351
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/552-0
01:51:17.591 --> 01:51:22.450
<v Mark Sedge>Then buy tasks so you get start of that
task complete of that task and you can do</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/548-0
01:51:21.431 --> 01:51:21.551
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/552-1
01:51:22.450 --> 01:51:25.057
<v Mark Sedge>that.
I think the point Deborah's trying to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/552-2
01:51:25.057 --> 01:51:29.679
<v Mark Sedge>sort of articulate is that ultimately
you've got a multitude of ways of doing</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/549-0
01:51:26.111 --> 01:51:26.231
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/552-3
01:51:29.679 --> 01:51:32.405
<v Mark Sedge>it.
The key thing is is about where you want.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/550-0
01:51:29.831 --> 01:51:29.951
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/552-4
01:51:32.405 --> 01:51:35.960
<v Mark Sedge>They're still discipline.
Your team still need to either be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/552-5
01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:36.671
<v Mark Sedge>disciplined.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/553-0
01:51:36.711 --> 01:51:40.511
<v Mark Sedge>To complete a task or discipline to
change a state and that I think is what</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/551-0
01:51:37.511 --> 01:51:37.631
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/553-1
01:51:40.511 --> 01:51:44.011
<v Mark Sedge>you're alluding to in ServiceNow,
it is easy. That's the point parek,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/553-2
01:51:44.011 --> 01:51:46.311
<v Mark Sedge>you've got your hand up.
You want to comment.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/554-0
01:51:47.591 --> 01:51:47.711
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/556-0
01:51:47.631 --> 01:51:50.253
<v Parik Narain>Yeah. Thanks, mark.
That's a mark on your last point, right,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/555-0
01:51:49.951 --> 01:51:50.071
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/556-1
01:51:50.253 --> 01:51:52.402
<v Parik Narain>the behaviour changes.
What do you want to drive?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/556-2
01:51:52.402 --> 01:51:55.325
<v Parik Narain>Obviously automations can follow if you
believe you know everybody,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/556-3
01:51:55.325 --> 01:51:58.463
<v Parik Narain>people are ready to work on the platform
and they're ready to, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/556-4
01:51:58.463 --> 01:52:00.655
<v Parik Narain>manually close this out, close the task,
etcetera.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/556-5
01:52:00.655 --> 01:52:03.750
<v Parik Narain>The the issues I've seen with these
automations, they're never perfect.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/556-6
01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:06.930
<v Parik Narain>And then you have to put a lot of
customizations on custom core on top to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/556-7
01:52:06.930 --> 01:52:07.231
<v Parik Narain>manage.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/559-0
01:52:07.311 --> 01:52:11.105
<v Parik Narain>These automations cause your tasks are
unique to your your business processes,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/559-1
01:52:11.105 --> 01:52:14.900
<v Parik Narain>so please keep that in mind because there
are multiple things to be considered</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/559-2
01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:18.454
<v Parik Narain>before we even think of automating
something within the platform which is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/559-3
01:52:18.454 --> 01:52:20.855
<v Parik Narain>not native.
And that's all I want to highlight at</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/560-0
01:52:19.191 --> 01:52:23.981
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not even thinking automation.
I'm more thinking like pop up prompts or</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/559-4
01:52:20.855 --> 01:52:21.671
<v Parik Narain>this point, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/560-1
01:52:23.981 --> 01:52:28.706
<v Josh Sparkes>that they can't move on without
completing a section or a stage that then</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/560-2
01:52:28.706 --> 01:52:32.474
<v Josh Sparkes>moves the case on.
So it's more of like a visual reminder.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/561-0
01:52:29.511 --> 01:52:32.531
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, that that we can control. Yeah,
absolutely.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/560-3
01:52:32.474 --> 01:52:33.751
<v Josh Sparkes>You just have those.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/561-1
01:52:32.531 --> 01:52:35.791
<v Parik Narain>That we can control with the workflow,
correct? Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/562-0
01:52:34.191 --> 01:52:38.922
<v Josh Sparkes>Speech cheques. Yes, I I don't. Yeah,
I don't think it's automation as such.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/562-1
01:52:38.922 --> 01:52:44.022
<v Josh Sparkes>It's more about that visual pop up to say,
hey, you've not filmed in this section.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/562-2
01:52:44.022 --> 01:52:47.217
<v Josh Sparkes>We need that information before we we
will do that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/563-0
01:52:46.311 --> 01:52:49.315
<v Parik Narain>That's OK, yeah. Yeah.
Mandatory fields sector are fine. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/562-3
01:52:47.217 --> 01:52:49.551
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can find mandatory films. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/563-1
01:52:49.315 --> 01:52:49.791
<v Parik Narain>that's OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/564-0
01:52:50.231 --> 01:52:50.351
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/565-0
01:52:50.791 --> 01:52:54.163
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the demo piece is something that
we can circle back on,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/565-1
01:52:54.163 --> 01:52:58.168
<v Josh Sparkes>but maybe just think about timing of it.
Now that we've done the workshops,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/565-2
01:52:58.168 --> 01:53:02.225
<v Josh Sparkes>we might have a bit more idea where we
can build something that's a bit more</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/565-3
01:53:02.225 --> 01:53:06.018
<v Josh Sparkes>specific to ask and how the workflows
work and combine all those. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/565-4
01:53:06.018 --> 01:53:09.443
<v Josh Sparkes>we've done demos, right.
We've done demos on the intro calls and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/565-5
01:53:09.443 --> 01:53:10.391
<v Josh Sparkes>it doesn't really.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/566-0
01:53:10.591 --> 01:53:13.343
<v Josh Sparkes>Level.
I'm just going to ask you to trust us,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/566-1
01:53:13.343 --> 01:53:18.068
<v Josh Sparkes>right? There's. I know it's easy to see.
There's a lot of work going on in the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/566-2
01:53:18.068 --> 01:53:22.913
<v Josh Sparkes>background and particularly perspective
is around that will change peace for our</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/566-3
01:53:22.913 --> 01:53:27.758
<v Josh Sparkes>stakeholders and for our internal team.
The system won't solve all the problems,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/566-4
01:53:27.758 --> 01:53:30.031
<v Josh Sparkes>but it will help us to actually serve.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/567-0
01:53:30.191 --> 01:53:30.591
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a lot.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/568-0
01:53:30.671 --> 01:53:34.192
<v Josh Sparkes>For those issues and find the right ways
to do it at this stage,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/568-1
01:53:34.192 --> 01:53:38.093
<v Josh Sparkes>this is our first Rider workshop.
We haven't made decisions on some key</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/568-2
01:53:38.093 --> 01:53:41.939
<v Josh Sparkes>fundamental things because we need to
consider what comes out in these</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/568-3
01:53:41.939 --> 01:53:44.755
<v Josh Sparkes>workshops to make the right decisions for
everyone.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/568-4
01:53:44.755 --> 01:53:49.089
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm just really calling just that.
It's important to get through the content</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/568-5
01:53:49.089 --> 01:53:50.551
<v Josh Sparkes>from your actual processes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/569-0
01:53:50.671 --> 01:53:53.045
<v Josh Sparkes>Today,
because this is the bulk of what in the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/569-1
01:53:53.045 --> 01:53:57.036
<v Josh Sparkes>when Josh will take away to be able to
then build those workflows so that they</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/569-2
01:53:57.036 --> 01:53:59.359
<v Josh Sparkes>we can start going,
that's not going to work.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/569-3
01:53:59.359 --> 01:54:02.137
<v Josh Sparkes>That is going to work and go through
those iterations.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/569-4
01:54:02.137 --> 01:54:05.723
<v Josh Sparkes>That's kind of the next stage.
So that's probably a good place to land</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/569-5
01:54:05.723 --> 01:54:08.400
<v Josh Sparkes>for great.
But I've never in my experience that live</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/569-6
01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:10.471
<v Josh Sparkes>ServiceNow people described it as clunky.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/570-0
01:54:11.071 --> 01:54:14.347
<v Josh Sparkes>And but you know actually it mobilises
the team in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/570-1
01:54:14.347 --> 01:54:17.433
<v Josh Sparkes>I can go from I've got headspace to added
value.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/570-2
01:54:17.433 --> 01:54:22.472
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean that's my in my experience with
the menu that I've done is that it's not</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/570-3
01:54:22.472 --> 01:54:26.504
<v Josh Sparkes>really correct. You know,
it's not only complete, it's correct,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/570-4
01:54:26.504 --> 01:54:27.511
<v Josh Sparkes>it's compliance.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/571-0
01:54:27.871 --> 01:54:33.285
<v Josh Sparkes>I can actually get some headspace to add
value back like rather than chasing your</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/571-1
01:54:33.285 --> 01:54:36.652
<v Josh Sparkes>tails in it.
So rest assured a bit that's a bit of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/571-2
01:54:36.652 --> 01:54:39.623
<v Josh Sparkes>trust and lead for quantum lead,
but that's,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/571-3
01:54:39.623 --> 01:54:42.791
<v Josh Sparkes>you know in my experience and you know
what we.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/572-0
01:54:43.191 --> 01:54:48.205
<v Josh Sparkes>I here for to ensure that you that
clunkiness word never comes into your</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/572-1
01:54:48.205 --> 01:54:51.296
<v Josh Sparkes>vocabulary,
but this is also an opportunity,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/572-2
01:54:51.296 --> 01:54:55.760
<v Josh Sparkes>like even for your team.
If you want to reset behaviours like it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/572-3
01:54:55.760 --> 01:55:00.979
<v Josh Sparkes>may not be the technology tool itself,
but some of the things we're talking</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/572-4
01:55:00.979 --> 01:55:01.391
<v Josh Sparkes>about.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/573-0
01:55:02.191 --> 01:55:06.200
<v Josh Sparkes>The technology can only do so much,
but if this is an opportunity to reset</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/573-1
01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:09.407
<v Josh Sparkes>just or if you think actually this
process could be better,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/573-2
01:55:09.407 --> 01:55:11.758
<v Josh Sparkes>I know we've only gone through one
process,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/573-3
01:55:11.758 --> 01:55:16.034
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's also an opportunity to challenge
yourselves and say actually it works.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/573-4
01:55:16.034 --> 01:55:20.043
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's working because we work,
but I think that's what fundamentals for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/573-5
01:55:20.043 --> 01:55:20.951
<v Josh Sparkes>me is more about.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/574-0
01:55:21.711 --> 01:55:26.090
<v Josh Sparkes>If I understand that I can sell that to
my team really easily and I think that's</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/574-1
01:55:26.090 --> 01:55:30.252
<v Josh Sparkes>from the lack then of understanding of
how on service now that works and how</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/574-2
01:55:30.252 --> 01:55:34.361
<v Josh Sparkes>that would work in practise to then
confidently deliver that message around</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/574-3
01:55:34.361 --> 01:55:38.577
<v Josh Sparkes>because I I'm completely and this is
going to change and it's going to be the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/574-4
01:55:38.577 --> 01:55:40.631
<v Josh Sparkes>best change for the farm and the team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/575-0
01:55:41.311 --> 01:55:44.950
<v Josh Sparkes>More about how I implement that change
for the team because it needs to be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/575-1
01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:48.977
<v Josh Sparkes>something that is beneficial for the team
and not seen as something going back the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/575-2
01:55:48.977 --> 01:55:51.014
<v Josh Sparkes>least.
We have to be careful about how to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/575-3
01:55:51.014 --> 01:55:53.586
<v Josh Sparkes>position that.
I think maybe I think the commitment,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/575-4
01:55:53.586 --> 01:55:56.691
<v Josh Sparkes>hopefully I'm not wrong,
is that we're either going to give you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/575-5
01:55:56.691 --> 01:56:00.378
<v Josh Sparkes>something like for like or better,
but ideally it's going to be better when</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/575-6
01:56:00.378 --> 01:56:00.911
<v Josh Sparkes>CC service.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/576-0
01:56:00.991 --> 01:56:04.975
<v Josh Sparkes>And I promise you, once I see it,
it will look cleaner. It's slicker.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/576-1
01:56:04.975 --> 01:56:09.072
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not going to say it's like Amazon,
but it's pretty user intuitive.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/576-2
01:56:09.072 --> 01:56:12.031
<v Josh Sparkes>It it really is.
I've I've actually got my support.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/576-3
01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:15.388
<v Josh Sparkes>We use service now,
so I'll show you my ticketing tool and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/576-4
01:56:15.388 --> 01:56:18.631
<v Josh Sparkes>how it works,
so maybe that'll give you some confidence.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/577-0
01:56:19.191 --> 01:56:23.024
<v Josh Sparkes>If you can't wait for the demo,
the other thing I was going to say was I</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/577-1
01:56:23.024 --> 01:56:27.330
<v Josh Sparkes>would still challenge yourselves to say,
like actually could this process be more</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/577-2
01:56:27.330 --> 01:56:31.268
<v Josh Sparkes>succinct? Could this workflow be better?
What can we do to help? You know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/577-3
01:56:31.268 --> 01:56:34.313
<v Josh Sparkes>Mark touched on it.
Is there something the skills broader</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/577-4
01:56:34.313 --> 01:56:37.411
<v Josh Sparkes>within the team?
This is also just an opportunity to reset</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/577-5
01:56:37.411 --> 01:56:38.671
<v Josh Sparkes>as a whole, if it helps.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/578-0
01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:43.342
<v Josh Sparkes>Drive the right behaviours and how you
work with the business. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/578-1
01:56:43.342 --> 01:56:48.024
<v Josh Sparkes>probably a good place to stop.
And I'm as I'm loving you've just done.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/578-2
01:56:48.024 --> 01:56:51.849
<v Josh Sparkes>Done end to end.
We've done happy part but you get it and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/578-3
01:56:51.849 --> 01:56:55.146
<v Josh Sparkes>you receive it and you work on it and
it's great.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/578-4
01:56:55.146 --> 01:56:58.311
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we've done all the hold and
iteration.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/579-0
01:56:58.591 --> 01:57:02.872
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe have a quick break and I it sounds
like we've just done one process,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/579-1
01:57:02.872 --> 01:57:07.210
<v Josh Sparkes>but actually we've discussed a lot of
language about I'm conscious that you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/579-2
01:57:07.210 --> 01:57:10.920
<v Josh Sparkes>think, Oh my goodness,
we've got that's not the case one because</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/579-3
01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:14.972
<v Josh Sparkes>you're challenging that us on the
language of what does that look like</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/579-4
01:57:14.972 --> 01:57:18.111
<v Josh Sparkes>assignment groups?
Who's going to inform notification?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/580-0
01:57:18.351 --> 01:57:23.081
<v Josh Sparkes>And as we go through these other ones
that manage events, you can say new,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/580-1
01:57:23.081 --> 01:57:26.550
<v Josh Sparkes>it's been assigned. If you work on it,
you do call it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/580-2
01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:31.721
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can sort of see repetitive by the
end you'll be you'll be you'll be almost</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/580-3
01:57:31.721 --> 01:57:33.991
<v Josh Sparkes>rattling new assigned notifications.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/581-0
01:57:34.271 --> 01:57:38.328
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's how we'll go through it.
So probably come back just to challenge</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/581-1
01:57:38.328 --> 01:57:42.118
<v Josh Sparkes>his support on cancellations or on hold,
you know how they're managed,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/581-2
01:57:42.118 --> 01:57:45.374
<v Josh Sparkes>if that even exists. You know,
does it come in once it's in,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/581-3
01:57:45.374 --> 01:57:49.591
<v Josh Sparkes>do they get cancelled or does the person
just remove it off the calendar? But.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/583-0
01:57:50.231 --> 01:57:54.932
<v Josh Sparkes>Should we have a quick break or do you
want to flush that out?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/583-1
01:57:54.932 --> 01:57:59.782
<v Josh Sparkes>Should we do that after? Yeah,
should come back at quarter past,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/583-2
01:57:59.782 --> 01:58:04.631
<v Josh Sparkes>quarter past, if that's OK. Yeah. Perfect.
Thank you. Thank you.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/582-0
01:58:01.151 --> 01:58:03.311
<v Mark Sedge>11:15 yeah, no problem.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/585-0
01:58:07.231 --> 01:58:12.293
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Did you want? I would.
I was gonna bring my extension.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/585-1
01:58:12.293 --> 01:58:15.031
<v Josh Sparkes>I would actually appreciate that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/630-0
02:10:27.537 --> 02:10:28.697
<v Mark Sedge>Ready when you are, Josh.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/664-0
02:14:48.017 --> 02:14:51.937
<v Mark Sedge>Are we back on Joshua? Not quite yet.
Can't hear anything so.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/666-0
02:14:55.737 --> 02:15:02.869
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you hear us, Mark? Sorry.
Can I just one quick question about the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/665-0
02:14:56.897 --> 02:14:57.977
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah, hear you now.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/666-1
02:15:02.869 --> 02:15:10.817
<v Josh Sparkes>chat, the yeah, the potential. Yeah.
So obviously there will be stakeholders.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/668-0
02:15:11.617 --> 02:15:16.579
<v Josh Sparkes>And the chat and the chat and service now
will be with the requester. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/668-1
02:15:16.579 --> 02:15:21.867
<v Josh Sparkes>so the the original requester, correct?
I don't know if this would be beneficial</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/668-2
02:15:21.867 --> 02:15:25.393
<v Josh Sparkes>or if it should be done or not because of
visibility,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/668-3
02:15:25.393 --> 02:15:30.290
<v Josh Sparkes>but is it possible to add people?
That's what we're saying in the original</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/668-4
02:15:30.290 --> 02:15:30.617
<v Josh Sparkes>form.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/669-0
02:15:30.977 --> 02:15:35.419
<v Josh Sparkes>If you've got those three people that you
are selecting that if you are awake</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/669-1
02:15:35.419 --> 02:15:40.147
<v Josh Sparkes>because the request might be a month in
advance that they also get informed. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/669-2
02:15:40.147 --> 02:15:43.906
<v Josh Sparkes>And is there like a, you know,
somebody else wants to share this,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/669-3
02:15:43.906 --> 02:15:46.697
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
like on a need to know basis and then?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/671-0
02:15:47.097 --> 02:15:51.172
<v Josh Sparkes>They're not part of those.
You can can you export or something? Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/671-1
02:15:51.172 --> 02:15:54.955
<v Josh Sparkes>or something. If if they wanna, like,
know what's been going on.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/670-0
02:15:54.497 --> 02:15:54.697
<v Mark Sedge>You.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/671-2
02:15:54.955 --> 02:15:59.845
<v Josh Sparkes>And they've been added so, you know, like,
oh, we've been given these three people,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/671-3
02:15:59.845 --> 02:16:03.455
<v Josh Sparkes>but like something happened.
Like they're not here but, like,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/671-4
02:16:03.455 --> 02:16:06.657
<v Josh Sparkes>so this person's gonna do it,
but they're not part of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/672-0
02:16:06.857 --> 02:16:11.903
<v Josh Sparkes>I think maybe that's a wide conversation.
If who needs to know when or you said</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/672-1
02:16:11.903 --> 02:16:16.572
<v Josh Sparkes>that it's the responsibility of the
requester to keep those people in the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/672-2
02:16:16.572 --> 02:16:19.537
<v Josh Sparkes>comms, maybe we can pop that link. Yes,
sorry.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/676-0
02:16:16.897 --> 02:16:20.736
<v Mark Sedge>But but it is worth, sorry, Deborah,
to jump in there,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/676-1
02:16:20.736 --> 02:16:26.391
<v Mark Sedge>it is worth just noting the agent or the
whoever it is that's responding to that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/673-0
02:16:24.777 --> 02:16:24.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/676-2
02:16:26.391 --> 02:16:29.672
<v Mark Sedge>record,
they can if I say do a right click you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/676-3
02:16:29.672 --> 02:16:34.140
<v Mark Sedge>know PD save it as a PDF and then send
that PDF PDF on to that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/674-0
02:16:33.337 --> 02:16:33.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/676-4
02:16:34.140 --> 02:16:35.537
<v Mark Sedge>You know that state.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/683-0
02:16:35.857 --> 02:16:40.868
<v Mark Sedge>If that stakeholder wanted to see the
transcript of what's gone on within that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/675-0
02:16:37.217 --> 02:16:37.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/677-0
02:16:39.177 --> 02:16:39.297
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/683-1
02:16:40.868 --> 02:16:43.849
<v Mark Sedge>record,
so there are various ways of doing it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/679-0
02:16:41.737 --> 02:16:43.097
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it's the agent.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/683-2
02:16:43.849 --> 02:16:48.225
<v Mark Sedge>There's also the mechanism where
potentially someone can do like it,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/680-0
02:16:45.857 --> 02:16:45.977
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/683-3
02:16:48.225 --> 02:16:51.778
<v Mark Sedge>depending on obviously what licencing
group they're in,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/681-0
02:16:49.537 --> 02:16:49.657
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/682-0
02:16:50.697 --> 02:16:50.817
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/683-4
02:16:51.778 --> 02:16:55.457
<v Mark Sedge>but they could also watch your record.
So you've got the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/686-0
02:16:55.537 --> 02:16:58.679
<v Mark Sedge>The ability for someone to be like an
interested party.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/684-0
02:16:58.137 --> 02:16:58.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/686-1
02:16:58.679 --> 02:17:01.540
<v Mark Sedge>They won't necessarily have any
involvement in it,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/685-0
02:17:01.017 --> 02:17:01.137
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/686-2
02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:03.617
<v Mark Sedge>but they can watch that record, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/687-0
02:17:02.777 --> 02:17:07.088
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah, it's also, I would,
I would probably be like reporting and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/687-1
02:17:07.088 --> 02:17:10.186
<v Josh Sparkes>we're digressing a little bit,
but is that if I'm,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/687-2
02:17:10.186 --> 02:17:13.647
<v Josh Sparkes>if I receive information,
what am I going to do with it?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/687-3
02:17:13.647 --> 02:17:18.263
<v Josh Sparkes>Why do I want that transcript? What am I?
What's the purpose of receiving a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/687-4
02:17:18.263 --> 02:17:21.057
<v Josh Sparkes>transcripts that I haven't been told
already?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/688-0
02:17:21.457 --> 02:17:24.211
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
and what's the actions on the back of it,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/688-1
02:17:24.211 --> 02:17:26.807
<v Josh Sparkes>these things can end up going in the it's
about.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/688-2
02:17:26.807 --> 02:17:30.992
<v Josh Sparkes>So now centralising controlling stuff
rather than exporting things out to then</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/688-3
02:17:30.992 --> 02:17:33.958
<v Josh Sparkes>go off. So yeah, my view, yeah,
my view on that one is,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/688-4
02:17:33.958 --> 02:17:37.137
<v Josh Sparkes>is that the only reason I would export or
look at the chat.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/689-0
02:17:37.497 --> 02:17:42.020
<v Josh Sparkes>Function would be to understand for a
case of landed or if there was moving</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/689-1
02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:47.019
<v Josh Sparkes>escalation or from a quality perspective,
we're we're looking at like a case from a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/689-2
02:17:47.019 --> 02:17:51.899
<v Josh Sparkes>business assurance perspective that we
would go back through the case file. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/689-3
02:17:51.899 --> 02:17:54.697
<v Josh Sparkes>I wouldn't see that the request or then
would.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/690-0
02:17:55.497 --> 02:17:59.794
<v Josh Sparkes>Take a copy or then pass that on the.
It's not an activity during.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/690-1
02:17:59.794 --> 02:18:04.284
<v Josh Sparkes>It's probably an activity,
not during the life cycle. Yes, it's more.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/690-2
02:18:04.284 --> 02:18:09.159
<v Josh Sparkes>It's more as a reporting function that
you might want to see for supporting</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/690-3
02:18:09.159 --> 02:18:09.737
<v Josh Sparkes>evidence.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/691-0
02:18:10.177 --> 02:18:12.846
<v Josh Sparkes>Of answering further questions, maybe.
Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/691-1
02:18:12.846 --> 02:18:15.991
<v Josh Sparkes>Even then you probably won't export this
chat. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/691-2
02:18:15.991 --> 02:18:19.076
<v Josh Sparkes>In terms of time and the purpose and need
for that,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/691-3
02:18:19.076 --> 02:18:24.060
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't see there'll be enough a need for
that. Yeah. No. OK. I was just wondering.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/691-4
02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:27.086
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. No,
I think it would tie in more with, like,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/691-5
02:18:27.086 --> 02:18:29.697
<v Josh Sparkes>John's team business insurance.
Retrospect.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/692-0
02:18:29.777 --> 02:18:34.564
<v Josh Sparkes>Checking if we had a case where there was
an escalation that would look back that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/692-1
02:18:34.564 --> 02:18:37.191
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah,
I wouldn't see myself in export and it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/692-2
02:18:37.191 --> 02:18:41.160
<v Josh Sparkes>would just probably export it,
Chuck it into Harvey and ask them to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/692-3
02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:44.254
<v Josh Sparkes>summarise.
And then you have to question what you're</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/692-4
02:18:44.254 --> 02:18:48.516
<v Josh Sparkes>going to. Yeah, with all these things,
what are you going to do with the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/692-5
02:18:48.516 --> 02:18:49.217
<v Josh Sparkes>information?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/693-0
02:18:50.857 --> 02:18:55.057
<v Josh Sparkes>That one evidence is really important and
it would then be on the request or to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/693-1
02:18:55.057 --> 02:18:59.206
<v Josh Sparkes>then communicate that to the partner
groups like that's the the role of CMG is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/693-2
02:18:59.206 --> 02:19:02.934
<v Josh Sparkes>to engage with the legal teams.
I have thought that would probably one</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/693-3
02:19:02.934 --> 02:19:04.457
<v Josh Sparkes>line or so. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/694-0
02:19:05.257 --> 02:19:07.831
<v Josh Sparkes>So the partner will probably want a one
line update,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/694-1
02:19:07.831 --> 02:19:10.600
<v Josh Sparkes>which is when am I getting it?
What do you need from me?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/694-2
02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:14.535
<v Josh Sparkes>What block is it you're facing? That's it.
I don't think they actually like her.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/694-3
02:19:14.535 --> 02:19:17.061
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know.
I've worked with a lot of I work with</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/694-4
02:19:17.061 --> 02:19:20.462
<v Josh Sparkes>partners or report to them.
They've never appreciated me hearing them</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/694-5
02:19:20.462 --> 02:19:23.377
<v Josh Sparkes>and running like,
countdown or their inbox is crazy enough.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/695-0
02:19:24.657 --> 02:19:30.032
<v Josh Sparkes>Can we go to council? That calendar?
Is there any activities where they might</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/695-1
02:19:30.032 --> 02:19:34.443
<v Josh Sparkes>say actually hold press?
I mean I'd love to say that I've never</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/695-2
02:19:34.443 --> 02:19:39.130
<v Josh Sparkes>said it in my life, but stop, you know,
hold press, it's not going.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/695-3
02:19:39.130 --> 02:19:43.817
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think that does happen very rarely
where we do get asked that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/696-0
02:19:43.977 --> 02:19:47.119
<v Josh Sparkes>We've maybe done all the work and then we
call it and share.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/696-1
02:19:47.119 --> 02:19:50.520
<v Josh Sparkes>We're no longer required,
so there's an element of the team we've</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/696-2
02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:53.714
<v Josh Sparkes>not touched on this,
but time recording in the system and for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/696-3
02:19:53.714 --> 02:19:57.784
<v Josh Sparkes>the allocate time and then I can see the
time versus the status of we've spent</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/696-4
02:19:57.784 --> 02:20:00.257
<v Josh Sparkes>time on kids,
but actually we've not delivered,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/696-5
02:20:00.257 --> 02:20:03.297
<v Josh Sparkes>but that's as a result of the stakeholder
group saying no.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/698-0
02:20:03.617 --> 02:20:06.504
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we're not progressing any further,
OK,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/698-1
02:20:06.504 --> 02:20:11.664
<v Josh Sparkes>so you get that you can capture that root
cause and you can do it to the assignment</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/698-2
02:20:11.664 --> 02:20:14.367
<v Josh Sparkes>of.
So what we're trying to capture is that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/698-3
02:20:14.367 --> 02:20:18.790
<v Josh Sparkes>the team put effort and time into that
case and that's been recognised,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/697-0
02:20:17.977 --> 02:20:19.257
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, 100%.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/698-4
02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:23.337
<v Josh Sparkes>but actual delivery and hasn't been
executed. But that's not as a result.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/699-0
02:20:23.377 --> 02:20:27.491
<v Josh Sparkes>Team that's as a result of it's still on
your metrics for post computers. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/699-1
02:20:27.491 --> 02:20:29.857
<v Josh Sparkes>And you can have that root cause because
yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/703-0
02:20:28.057 --> 02:20:31.551
<v Mark Sedge>Well, you'd you what?
You what you could do there is you could</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/700-0
02:20:31.337 --> 02:20:31.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/703-1
02:20:31.551 --> 02:20:35.268
<v Mark Sedge>have a classification of closed
incomplete and then you just put a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/701-0
02:20:33.177 --> 02:20:33.297
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/703-2
02:20:35.268 --> 02:20:38.929
<v Mark Sedge>statement as to why and then you can
report how many were closed,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/702-0
02:20:38.177 --> 02:20:38.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/703-3
02:20:38.929 --> 02:20:43.422
<v Mark Sedge>incomplete where you've done X amount of
time and it's been pulled by the by the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/703-4
02:20:43.422 --> 02:20:43.977
<v Mark Sedge>requester.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/704-0
02:20:44.897 --> 02:20:47.652
<v Josh Sparkes>So it can either be,
it can either be included in your</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/704-1
02:20:47.652 --> 02:20:51.310
<v Josh Sparkes>reporting or not included in your
reporting and you as answered that you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/704-2
02:20:51.310 --> 02:20:54.367
<v Josh Sparkes>could back closely and complete is a nice
section in itself,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/704-3
02:20:54.367 --> 02:20:58.325
<v Josh Sparkes>but you can see that these are the ones
that we worked on and look through the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/704-4
02:20:58.325 --> 02:21:02.534
<v Josh Sparkes>region for and there's there's probably 2
angles whereby we do spend time on it and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/704-5
02:21:02.534 --> 02:21:03.737
<v Josh Sparkes>it's no longer required.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/705-0
02:21:03.977 --> 02:21:07.990
<v Josh Sparkes>Or then straight up we no longer required
and we didn't spend any huge amount of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/705-1
02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:11.955
<v Josh Sparkes>time, so maybe 5 minutes back and forth,
but the requests are and it was then a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/705-2
02:21:11.955 --> 02:21:15.919
<v Josh Sparkes>little longer required because actually
up to which stage it was cancelled out.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/705-3
02:21:15.919 --> 02:21:19.537
<v Josh Sparkes>So it might just be that it was why we
didn't even do any work on it so.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/707-0
02:21:20.257 --> 02:21:24.951
<v Josh Sparkes>And you don't specify that the system
will know how much time you spend,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/707-1
02:21:24.951 --> 02:21:29.645
<v Josh Sparkes>so and what was completed people
checklist at each stage engaged or each</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/707-2
02:21:29.645 --> 02:21:32.861
<v Josh Sparkes>part. You know,
each phase of the workflow. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/706-0
02:21:31.537 --> 02:21:33.897
<v Mark Sedge>My, my the sorry.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/707-3
02:21:32.861 --> 02:21:33.697
<v Josh Sparkes>And is it so?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/711-0
02:21:36.537 --> 02:21:41.485
<v Mark Sedge>I was just going back to the stakeholders
in the process who has the accountability</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/708-0
02:21:37.337 --> 02:21:37.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/709-0
02:21:41.417 --> 02:21:41.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/711-1
02:21:41.485 --> 02:21:46.258
<v Mark Sedge>to manage the stakeholders because logic
would say if I was requesting on behalf</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/711-2
02:21:46.258 --> 02:21:49.910
<v Mark Sedge>of my stakeholders,
then I as the request have responsibility</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/710-0
02:21:46.937 --> 02:21:47.057
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/711-3
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:53.917
<v Mark Sedge>to update my stakeholders,
not necessarily my delivery to you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/711-4
02:21:53.917 --> 02:21:56.097
<v Mark Sedge>the teams doing the work. What's the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/713-0
02:21:56.257 --> 02:22:01.337
<v Josh Sparkes>That, that's just what we're seeing more.
Yeah, it was just saying that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/712-0
02:21:56.457 --> 02:21:58.097
<v Mark Sedge>What's the structure?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/714-0
02:22:00.737 --> 02:22:03.657
<v Mark Sedge>I'm sorry,
I I I clearly missed missed the dialogue.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/715-0
02:22:04.177 --> 02:22:07.291
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
that was upfront requester and it could</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/715-1
02:22:07.291 --> 02:22:11.828
<v Josh Sparkes>be names additionals as well.
But get informed that you could have</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/715-2
02:22:11.828 --> 02:22:15.959
<v Josh Sparkes>three or four at the point of requesting
this piece of work,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/715-3
02:22:15.959 --> 02:22:20.834
<v Josh Sparkes>particularly that it could be a month in
advance and you might be away.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/715-4
02:22:20.834 --> 02:22:23.137
<v Josh Sparkes>So they also incorporated upfront.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/716-0
02:22:24.257 --> 02:22:27.735
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it's like a selection.
So a selection.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/716-1
02:22:27.735 --> 02:22:29.977
<v Josh Sparkes>Does that answer your points?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/718-0
02:22:29.577 --> 02:22:34.151
<v Mark Sedge>Well, it it it it it it partly does.
In a sense they get visibility of the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/717-0
02:22:33.577 --> 02:22:33.697
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/718-1
02:22:34.151 --> 02:22:38.970
<v Mark Sedge>record and what have you. But there's a,
there's a subtlety of what the the So</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/718-2
02:22:38.970 --> 02:22:41.714
<v Mark Sedge>what?
So it you know they might look at that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/718-3
02:22:41.714 --> 02:22:46.228
<v Mark Sedge>and then do they tassel these team
because they yeah they might want more</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/718-4
02:22:46.228 --> 02:22:49.217
<v Mark Sedge>information or do they know that they
should be.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/722-0
02:22:49.457 --> 02:22:52.957
<v Mark Sedge>Facing with their requester because what
you don't want is failure.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/719-0
02:22:52.857 --> 02:22:52.977
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/722-1
02:22:52.957 --> 02:22:57.229
<v Mark Sedge>Demand of these guys picking up directly
from a straight stakeholder community for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/722-2
02:22:57.229 --> 02:22:59.597
<v Mark Sedge>which they're not responsible to be
managing,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/721-0
02:22:59.497 --> 02:22:59.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/722-3
02:22:59.597 --> 02:23:02.377
<v Mark Sedge>and it gets in the way of them doing the
work, right.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/724-0
02:23:03.417 --> 02:23:08.343
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's notified that close complete
stage isn't it more than from the legal</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/724-1
02:23:08.343 --> 02:23:12.910
<v Josh Sparkes>team perspective and the CMG is then
responsible for that regular update if</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/724-2
02:23:12.910 --> 02:23:15.674
<v Josh Sparkes>needed.
Really when you think about it or BMC</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/724-3
02:23:15.674 --> 02:23:17.777
<v Josh Sparkes>depending who they're requested as.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/725-0
02:23:19.457 --> 02:23:26.572
<v Josh Sparkes>So it will either be VIVSC or CMG stand
marketing and so it would be either of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/725-1
02:23:26.572 --> 02:23:33.057
<v Josh Sparkes>those three areas that are essentially
responsible for feeding back to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/727-0
02:23:33.657 --> 02:23:37.355
<v Josh Sparkes>Legal teams or other teams that they're
working on on behalf of,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/727-1
02:23:37.355 --> 02:23:41.737
<v Josh Sparkes>it's those functions that would report
back, but I think well, there's more.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/726-0
02:23:38.257 --> 02:23:38.457
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/728-0
02:23:41.257 --> 02:23:45.247
<v Mark Sedge>And now and now, if you scored that,
if you scored that out of 1010 being</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/728-1
02:23:45.247 --> 02:23:48.321
<v Mark Sedge>highly successful, no,
no one being not very successful,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/728-2
02:23:48.321 --> 02:23:49.777
<v Mark Sedge>where would you score that?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/730-0
02:23:51.057 --> 02:23:56.766
<v Josh Sparkes>It depends on the group mark.
It works well sometimes directly.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/729-0
02:23:54.737 --> 02:23:56.417
<v Mark Sedge>Average average it for me.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/730-1
02:23:56.766 --> 02:24:02.208
<v Josh Sparkes>What was you saying?
If you work directly with the the legal</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/730-2
02:24:02.208 --> 02:24:06.937
<v Josh Sparkes>team, sometimes that's more efficient.
Yeah, versus.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/731-0
02:24:08.497 --> 02:24:12.559
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes. Well,
it all depends on the type of work.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/731-1
02:24:12.559 --> 02:24:16.162
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes. Yeah.
For example for like uploads,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/731-2
02:24:16.162 --> 02:24:21.911
<v Josh Sparkes>it probably work more efficiently if we
work directly with the legal teams</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/731-3
02:24:21.911 --> 02:24:26.817
<v Josh Sparkes>because they are the one who drafted the
the articles and they.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/733-0
02:24:26.897 --> 02:24:33.711
<v Josh Sparkes>He knows where all the all the places
that they want to make the changes,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/733-1
02:24:33.711 --> 02:24:41.354
<v Josh Sparkes>but then I think it was I would put like
five or six. Would that be too low? Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/732-0
02:24:39.057 --> 02:24:42.337
<v Mark Sedge>OK, so not too bad. OK. Yeah. Thanks.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/733-2
02:24:41.354 --> 02:24:44.577
<v Josh Sparkes>Five or six on a scale of 10. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/734-0
02:24:46.457 --> 02:24:50.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Successful. Yeah. So Mark, your point is.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/737-0
02:24:48.657 --> 02:24:52.638
<v Mark Sedge>Josh, sorry, just on a sorry Josh,
while I can you just swing the camera</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/735-0
02:24:52.577 --> 02:24:52.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, ma'am.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/737-1
02:24:52.638 --> 02:24:57.111
<v Mark Sedge>slightly further round because the main
table is sort of emptied a little bit and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/737-2
02:24:57.111 --> 02:25:00.057
<v Mark Sedge>I'm just trying to pick up on who's else
in the room.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/736-0
02:24:57.217 --> 02:24:57.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/738-0
02:25:00.737 --> 02:25:05.193
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm charging my laptops for holding
laptop points.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/738-1
02:25:05.193 --> 02:25:08.777
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't think the camera goes over there.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/739-0
02:25:09.377 --> 02:25:12.577
<v Mark Sedge>Will it not swing round anymore to the
left or your right?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/742-0
02:25:14.817 --> 02:25:17.432
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I don't think it will capture the whole</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/740-0
02:25:16.937 --> 02:25:19.817
<v Mark Sedge>All right, don't worry about it.
Don't worry, don't worry.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/742-1
02:25:17.432 --> 02:25:21.525
<v Josh Sparkes>view of the road. You also say,
I suppose what you're saying is that if</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/742-2
02:25:21.525 --> 02:25:25.959
<v Josh Sparkes>you're informed that those three or four
can also circumnavigate and then be,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/742-3
02:25:25.959 --> 02:25:29.882
<v Josh Sparkes>you're over communicated, you know,
the same people could be asking,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/741-0
02:25:29.017 --> 02:25:29.537
<v Mark Sedge>Yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/742-4
02:25:29.882 --> 02:25:31.417
<v Josh Sparkes>but you're probably saying.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/743-0
02:25:31.497 --> 02:25:35.138
<v Josh Sparkes>So that this communication is at the
point of post complete,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/743-1
02:25:35.138 --> 02:25:39.436
<v Josh Sparkes>the requester is the main who the
employee centre is the comms and it's</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/743-2
02:25:39.436 --> 02:25:43.734
<v Josh Sparkes>their duty to inform that a post complete
a bit like get. In hindsight,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/743-3
02:25:43.734 --> 02:25:47.137
<v Josh Sparkes>everyone gets told that needs to be told
that it's done.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/745-0
02:25:47.617 --> 02:25:51.622
<v Josh Sparkes>At those complete stage,
I think all we need to be careful is is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/744-0
02:25:49.937 --> 02:25:50.177
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/745-1
02:25:51.622 --> 02:25:55.689
<v Josh Sparkes>too many perks as well.
So like that there there's a a balance we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/745-2
02:25:55.689 --> 02:25:59.572
<v Josh Sparkes>need to strike off in.
If we have too many people contributing</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/745-3
02:25:59.572 --> 02:26:02.653
<v Josh Sparkes>to an article,
it can be the company and it's not</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/745-4
02:26:02.653 --> 02:26:05.796
<v Josh Sparkes>efficient.
So if you have maybe one or two lawyers</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/745-5
02:26:05.796 --> 02:26:07.337
<v Josh Sparkes>that you're working with.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/746-0
02:26:07.617 --> 02:26:10.983
<v Josh Sparkes>Basically,
that works sufficiently for you to start</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/746-1
02:26:10.983 --> 02:26:15.450
<v Josh Sparkes>to have a pool of legal teams.
It becomes really ineffective because</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/746-2
02:26:15.450 --> 02:26:20.629
<v Josh Sparkes>they're all arguing over what over whose
point is more valid and what should be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/746-3
02:26:20.629 --> 02:26:22.377
<v Josh Sparkes>included, and that doesn't.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/747-0
02:26:22.817 --> 02:26:26.994
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't need to be involved in that,
so I think it's about getting striking</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/747-1
02:26:26.994 --> 02:26:31.443
<v Josh Sparkes>the balance between who actually needs to
be informed and who is going to give us</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/747-2
02:26:31.443 --> 02:26:34.644
<v Josh Sparkes>the information that is that maybe they
remain two people.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/747-3
02:26:34.644 --> 02:26:38.497
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's one request that they get the
running updates all the back up.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/748-0
02:26:38.977 --> 02:26:43.583
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't oppose complete the parties that
need to know will know at the same time</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/748-1
02:26:43.583 --> 02:26:46.938
<v Josh Sparkes>as the clester. Yeah,
and that's that selection that we're</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/748-2
02:26:46.938 --> 02:26:49.440
<v Josh Sparkes>buying. It's not a huge distribution.
Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/748-3
02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:51.942
<v Josh Sparkes>that's going to be covered or closed.
Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/748-4
02:26:51.942 --> 02:26:54.558
<v Josh Sparkes>Closed Council with the root cause or
closed.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/748-5
02:26:54.558 --> 02:26:57.857
<v Josh Sparkes>Incomplete with the root cause analysis
you're reporting.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/749-0
02:26:58.617 --> 02:27:03.397
<v Josh Sparkes>And again at the same time,
the requester and whoever needs to know</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/749-1
02:27:03.397 --> 02:27:08.036
<v Josh Sparkes>will know that at the same time should we
go to the publications.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/749-2
02:27:08.036 --> 02:27:12.464
<v Josh Sparkes>Now I'm not sure this comes.
It could be post event pre event.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/749-3
02:27:12.464 --> 02:27:17.737
<v Josh Sparkes>There could be all sorts of stages that
we should get this but I wondered.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/750-0
02:27:17.937 --> 02:27:20.845
<v Josh Sparkes>Do we?
This is a natural point to do these or</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/750-1
02:27:20.845 --> 02:27:25.460
<v Josh Sparkes>should we do manage events? I don't mind.
There's a few things in there,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/750-2
02:27:25.460 --> 02:27:28.747
<v Josh Sparkes>so we've got bit and pitch and then I
thought yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/750-3
02:27:28.747 --> 02:27:32.857
<v Josh Sparkes>publications and social media or there's
some Research Services.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/751-0
02:27:33.497 --> 02:27:38.294
<v Josh Sparkes>We just have quickly got the Research
Services that probably naturally falls</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/751-1
02:27:38.294 --> 02:27:43.653
<v Josh Sparkes>research. Yeah, research is quite the top,
isn't it? So yeah, increases a lot bigger.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/751-2
02:27:43.653 --> 02:27:47.640
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. To do this one next. Yeah.
Based on company and industry.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/751-3
02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:52.002
<v Josh Sparkes>So how do they come in? With what?
What comes in or is that a result?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/751-4
02:27:52.002 --> 02:27:52.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you have to?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/752-0
02:27:53.057 --> 02:28:00.334
<v Josh Sparkes>Do research as part of the good is that a
sub process or an additional process this</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/752-1
02:28:00.334 --> 02:28:07.005
<v Josh Sparkes>way this is the business intelligence
team requesting support for their team</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/752-2
02:28:07.005 --> 02:28:12.377
<v Josh Sparkes>through our forms so they're generally
are good stakeholders.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/753-0
02:28:14.217 --> 02:28:16.967
<v Josh Sparkes>They give us the SLA,
they know what the Slas are,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/753-1
02:28:16.967 --> 02:28:19.610
<v Josh Sparkes>they adhere to the SLA,
where they possibly can.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/753-2
02:28:19.610 --> 02:28:22.577
<v Josh Sparkes>They say expectations with their and
request or group.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/754-0
02:28:24.417 --> 02:28:24.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/755-0
02:28:26.057 --> 02:28:26.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/756-0
02:28:26.257 --> 02:28:30.086
<v Josh Sparkes>So how do they come into today?
So you get through the form through the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/756-1
02:28:30.086 --> 02:28:32.532
<v Josh Sparkes>form. Yes. Saying the operational form,
yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/756-2
02:28:32.532 --> 02:28:34.926
<v Josh Sparkes>they just select what the categorization
is,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/756-3
02:28:34.926 --> 02:28:39.233
<v Josh Sparkes>the timelines and when it's required by
and give us really detailed information.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/756-4
02:28:39.233 --> 02:28:42.425
<v Josh Sparkes>They don't want to get a calendar. No, no,
no, not in that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/756-5
02:28:42.425 --> 02:28:45.297
<v Josh Sparkes>It's in the one that mandish.
Did you share that one?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/757-0
02:28:46.417 --> 02:28:51.032
<v Josh Sparkes>I I don't think so.
So we have the regular work request form.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/757-1
02:28:51.032 --> 02:28:56.094
<v Josh Sparkes>So for the business intelligent research
work they I mean the team,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/757-2
02:28:56.094 --> 02:29:01.230
<v Josh Sparkes>they have a very small team.
So sometimes they are unable to pick up</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/757-3
02:29:01.230 --> 02:29:05.697
<v Josh Sparkes>all the all the tasks.
So some of them just overflow to us.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/758-0
02:29:05.737 --> 02:29:11.564
<v Josh Sparkes>To us and we are picking up whenever we
have capacity to help them with.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/758-1
02:29:11.564 --> 02:29:18.190
<v Josh Sparkes>So they submit the request through to us
through the form that we have on share on</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/758-2
02:29:18.190 --> 02:29:22.899
<v Josh Sparkes>on SharePoint, yeah.
So just actually it's a good point is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/758-3
02:29:22.899 --> 02:29:24.257
<v Josh Sparkes>this the is this.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/759-0
02:29:25.097 --> 02:29:29.648
<v Josh Sparkes>And they got share with SharePoint and
yeah, and we get it, it lands with us,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/759-1
02:29:29.648 --> 02:29:32.857
<v Josh Sparkes>I understand.
So is this just a challenge that is that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/759-2
02:29:32.857 --> 02:29:35.833
<v Josh Sparkes>something,
I mean we've seen actually through some</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/759-3
02:29:35.833 --> 02:29:40.676
<v Josh Sparkes>of the workshops is should it be with you,
should it be with then does it land you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/759-4
02:29:40.676 --> 02:29:44.177
<v Josh Sparkes>know when the music stops it then so it
sounds like you're.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/760-0
02:29:44.337 --> 02:29:49.534
<v Josh Sparkes>Over is it. Is it an overflow capacity?
So we are basically overflow to so</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/760-1
02:29:49.534 --> 02:29:54.038
<v Josh Sparkes>overflow to that team.
So the volume is around about 40-50 and a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/760-2
02:29:54.038 --> 02:29:57.641
<v Josh Sparkes>quarter in that region of requests as a
small team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/760-3
02:29:57.641 --> 02:30:02.977
<v Josh Sparkes>And with those particular areas that were
identified, we would then be that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/761-0
02:30:03.937 --> 02:30:08.080
<v Josh Sparkes>I say overflow,
but we are and should be the first point</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/761-1
02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:13.460
<v Josh Sparkes>of contact for those categories.
So even if they extended their team for,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/761-2
02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:16.949
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
head counts that you would they would</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/761-3
02:30:16.949 --> 02:30:20.657
<v Josh Sparkes>you're saying is because of particular
categories?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/762-0
02:30:21.457 --> 02:30:24.704
<v Josh Sparkes>Of this research,
it would land naturally with your,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/762-1
02:30:24.704 --> 02:30:29.421
<v Josh Sparkes>so it should just come to us. Yes,
exactly. So it shouldn't even touch them.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/762-2
02:30:29.421 --> 02:30:32.974
<v Josh Sparkes>That's for client.
We can take this aspect. So generally,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/762-3
02:30:32.974 --> 02:30:36.895
<v Josh Sparkes>with a research task,
there's several elements that create that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/762-4
02:30:36.895 --> 02:30:40.817
<v Josh Sparkes>one task that for a certain aspect being
the categories for us.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/763-0
02:30:41.177 --> 02:30:44.231
<v Josh Sparkes>We would check that as long as they're
briefing us in,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/763-1
02:30:44.231 --> 02:30:47.062
<v Josh Sparkes>that's a good sort of knowledge article.
You know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/763-2
02:30:47.062 --> 02:30:51.060
<v Josh Sparkes>like when people are requesting it,
it doesn't go to them and then it's</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/763-3
02:30:51.060 --> 02:30:54.003
<v Josh Sparkes>rerouted.
It could be that these this is what we do.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/763-4
02:30:54.003 --> 02:30:56.613
<v Josh Sparkes>This is our company industry research
matters.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/763-5
02:30:56.613 --> 02:30:59.057
<v Josh Sparkes>So that first point of when it's
requested.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/764-0
02:30:59.497 --> 02:31:03.631
<v Josh Sparkes>It goes to yourself,
not goes to any direction because the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/764-1
02:31:03.631 --> 02:31:08.886
<v Josh Sparkes>overall research task could potentially
cover certain aspects that certain</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/764-2
02:31:08.886 --> 02:31:14.282
<v Josh Sparkes>aspects go to different teams. Yeah.
So that could be rooted that these ones</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/764-3
02:31:14.282 --> 02:31:18.977
<v Josh Sparkes>on that query form come to yourself. OK.
So you're not getting it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/765-0
02:31:19.057 --> 02:31:24.450
<v Josh Sparkes>So the question is, George,
did you want a additional what happens to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/765-1
02:31:24.450 --> 02:31:30.844
<v Josh Sparkes>the ones that don't come in to ask and go
to a function that are not on ServiceNow</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/765-2
02:31:30.844 --> 02:31:35.467
<v Josh Sparkes>as users through the query?
What could happen, for example,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/765-3
02:31:35.467 --> 02:31:38.857
<v Josh Sparkes>if we said I've got a research matter
that?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/766-0
02:31:38.977 --> 02:31:43.350
<v Josh Sparkes>Need to do and that's the request through
ServiceNow. Yeah, it will trigger that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/766-1
02:31:43.350 --> 02:31:47.403
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it the company industry leading
questions. So if it, if that's the case,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/766-2
02:31:47.403 --> 02:31:49.963
<v Josh Sparkes>yes, clients. If not,
then they get the e-mail.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/766-3
02:31:49.963 --> 02:31:54.230
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we've seen some examples where it
routes if they're not in service now,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/766-4
02:31:54.230 --> 02:31:57.963
<v Josh Sparkes>they get the e-mail with that information
with that request form. OK,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/766-5
02:31:57.963 --> 02:31:58.817
<v Josh Sparkes>so who requests?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/767-0
02:31:58.937 --> 02:32:05.359
<v Josh Sparkes>This research stuff so can can we CMG go
into the current processes,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/767-1
02:32:05.359 --> 02:32:11.130
<v Josh Sparkes>CMG or legal staff will go to the
business intelligence team,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/767-2
02:32:11.130 --> 02:32:17.180
<v Josh Sparkes>build out what they need,
and the apple also, there's no e-mail,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/767-3
02:32:17.180 --> 02:32:18.577
<v Josh Sparkes>no that can be.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/768-0
02:32:18.737 --> 02:32:21.910
<v Josh Sparkes>Conversation and e-mail.
And then from there,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/768-1
02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:27.085
<v Josh Sparkes>the business intelligence team decide
what aspects of that they will take.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/768-2
02:32:27.085 --> 02:32:31.708
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the other elements where we need
to be looked done. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/768-3
02:32:31.708 --> 02:32:37.021
<v Josh Sparkes>So the requester needs to be business
intelligence and they need to be using</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/768-4
02:32:37.021 --> 02:32:37.297
<v Josh Sparkes>the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/769-0
02:32:37.497 --> 02:32:41.108
<v Josh Sparkes>The portal to come to you,
they'll know that, though. Yes, they do.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/769-1
02:32:41.108 --> 02:32:44.614
<v Josh Sparkes>So this could be a subset of all the
research that they're doing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/769-2
02:32:44.614 --> 02:32:48.810
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that what you're saying as well? Yes.
There's only certain elements that we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/769-3
02:32:48.810 --> 02:32:52.954
<v Josh Sparkes>cover to support business intelligence
and business intelligence are the ones</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/769-4
02:32:52.954 --> 02:32:53.857
<v Josh Sparkes>that brief us so.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/771-0
02:32:54.617 --> 02:32:59.591
<v Josh Sparkes>They're already engaged with CMG and the
the route is always business intelligence</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/771-1
02:32:59.591 --> 02:33:03.427
<v Josh Sparkes>first, being the experts today route,
what is the full request?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/771-2
02:33:03.427 --> 02:33:08.402
<v Josh Sparkes>Because it wouldn't just be what you're
doing. Yeah, it can come in direct to you.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/771-3
02:33:08.402 --> 02:33:11.099
<v Josh Sparkes>Business intelligence are the good
children.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/771-4
02:33:11.099 --> 02:33:13.857
<v Josh Sparkes>They put it in the form and give us the
time.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/772-0
02:33:13.977 --> 02:33:18.187
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like the S delays speaking unless
it's something that is or is something</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/772-1
02:33:18.187 --> 02:33:21.750
<v Josh Sparkes>that is genuinely urgent.
That's where you know and it is urgent.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/772-2
02:33:21.750 --> 02:33:26.068
<v Josh Sparkes>So then, so that question coming to you,
what information should I do? Control.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/772-3
02:33:26.068 --> 02:33:28.606
<v Josh Sparkes>Right.
And would we want that for lock down to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/772-4
02:33:28.606 --> 02:33:31.737
<v Josh Sparkes>business intelligence?
So it's only them that can see it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/773-0
02:33:33.217 --> 02:33:34.777
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, for those categories.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/774-0
02:33:40.137 --> 02:33:44.504
<v Josh Sparkes>And so a bit again, information upfront.
So they're not the back and forth.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/774-1
02:33:44.504 --> 02:33:48.700
<v Josh Sparkes>You have a standard list that you have
that or they they're pretty good.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/774-2
02:33:48.700 --> 02:33:51.574
<v Josh Sparkes>They know they communicate with you all
the time,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/774-3
02:33:51.574 --> 02:33:56.057
<v Josh Sparkes>but they can give you who's it for,
what's it for, you know as pre populated.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/775-0
02:33:56.497 --> 02:33:59.573
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you have that for me today,
or does that exist?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/775-1
02:33:59.573 --> 02:34:04.400
<v Josh Sparkes>It's part of the operational forum for
that we have and it's just a category on</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/775-2
02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:09.407
<v Josh Sparkes>that form of what we can support from and
it just at the minute just says BIU only</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/775-3
02:34:09.407 --> 02:34:14.234
<v Josh Sparkes>IE business intelligence are the only
ones to use that category to briefing for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/775-4
02:34:14.234 --> 02:34:14.777
<v Josh Sparkes>the team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/776-0
02:34:15.457 --> 02:34:18.221
<v Josh Sparkes>Again. And what?
But what else would you need in order to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/776-1
02:34:18.221 --> 02:34:20.605
<v Josh Sparkes>start it? So I've got it.
How do you start? What?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/776-2
02:34:20.605 --> 02:34:22.417
<v Josh Sparkes>What other information would you need?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/777-0
02:34:24.177 --> 02:34:29.405
<v Josh Sparkes>So they really just detail and the
description of what what it is,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/777-1
02:34:29.405 --> 02:34:35.180
<v Josh Sparkes>the timelines, the, the sources,
the people profiles like thin searching,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/777-2
02:34:35.180 --> 02:34:41.502
<v Josh Sparkes>how they how the information then how
they want the information to be presented.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/777-3
02:34:41.502 --> 02:34:43.297
<v Josh Sparkes>So sometimes they will.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/778-0
02:34:43.497 --> 02:34:48.034
<v Josh Sparkes>That provide us with the templates.
So just like can you put all this</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/778-1
02:34:48.034 --> 02:34:52.053
<v Josh Sparkes>information into on this template and
send it back to us? OK,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/778-2
02:34:52.053 --> 02:34:57.303
<v Josh Sparkes>so we can use that as a checklist of the
entry point that they complete and then</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/778-3
02:34:57.303 --> 02:35:00.544
<v Josh Sparkes>it, yeah,
we can just build what build on what we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/778-4
02:35:00.544 --> 02:35:03.137
<v Josh Sparkes>have of that form. And here's the extra.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/779-0
02:35:03.297 --> 02:35:06.320
<v Josh Sparkes>Information for people,
profiles or events that have to be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/779-1
02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:10.470
<v Josh Sparkes>searched up so it's hardly flowing tacks
that they just start typing in and just</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/779-2
02:35:10.470 --> 02:35:14.466
<v Josh Sparkes>right now the guests they are. Yeah.
So we're just saying that we're going to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/779-3
02:35:14.466 --> 02:35:16.721
<v Josh Sparkes>use that as you know, check this,
you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/779-4
02:35:16.721 --> 02:35:18.617
<v Josh Sparkes>so they're sort of leading questions.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/780-0
02:35:19.497 --> 02:35:22.834
<v Josh Sparkes>And then they will arrive with yourself,
and you can, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/780-1
02:35:22.834 --> 02:35:26.693
<v Josh Sparkes>and there could be a checklist or you'll
get all of them or some of them,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/780-2
02:35:26.693 --> 02:35:30.030
<v Josh Sparkes>but you will send me those ones that are
mandatory. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/780-3
02:35:30.030 --> 02:35:33.368
<v Josh Sparkes>But is there a standard set of inputs you
would generally need?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/780-4
02:35:33.368 --> 02:35:36.497
<v Josh Sparkes>It sounds like you do have that from that
minimum standard.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/781-0
02:35:38.417 --> 02:35:41.433
<v Josh Sparkes>Written rule,
I suppose that business intelligence just.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/781-1
02:35:41.433 --> 02:35:43.655
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
they know what we need because they</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/781-2
02:35:43.655 --> 02:35:47.888
<v Josh Sparkes>understand the work and they need to be
fussed in the right way in order for us</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/781-3
02:35:47.888 --> 02:35:50.957
<v Josh Sparkes>to pick up. Yeah,
but we could use that as the and then a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/781-4
02:35:50.957 --> 02:35:53.497
<v Josh Sparkes>bit like the one that we discussed today.
Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/782-0
02:35:54.217 --> 02:36:00.192
<v Josh Sparkes>So it comes into yourself as new is there
the does you have the same pain pain</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/782-1
02:36:00.192 --> 02:36:06.168
<v Josh Sparkes>points of? If only we knew when they knew?
Or does it tend to be that with the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/782-2
02:36:06.168 --> 02:36:10.026
<v Josh Sparkes>business intelligence team they know the
timeline,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/782-3
02:36:10.026 --> 02:36:12.977
<v Josh Sparkes>so it's pretty reasonable to be honest.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/783-0
02:36:13.617 --> 02:36:18.066
<v Josh Sparkes>Unless you've got any examples Monday,
but I think generally speaking they're</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/783-1
02:36:18.066 --> 02:36:21.545
<v Josh Sparkes>pretty reasonable with Slas.
What's the SLA wasn't one hour?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/783-2
02:36:21.545 --> 02:36:25.823
<v Josh Sparkes>It depends on the categories. It's days,
yeah. Sometimes days. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/783-3
02:36:25.823 --> 02:36:29.075
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe we've got categories rather than
company industry.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/783-4
02:36:29.075 --> 02:36:32.897
<v Josh Sparkes>What what categories are there? Yeah,
I can share my screen. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/784-0
02:36:33.457 --> 02:36:33.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/785-0
02:36:37.057 --> 02:36:41.082
<v Josh Sparkes>Because this was when you come into that
prioritisation or skill matrix,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/785-1
02:36:41.082 --> 02:36:45.548
<v Josh Sparkes>you know maybe in your skills that you
work on a particular industry or you work</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/785-2
02:36:45.548 --> 02:36:49.904
<v Josh Sparkes>on a particular company or maybe there's
avip or there's whatever it is we can</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/785-3
02:36:49.904 --> 02:36:50.897
<v Josh Sparkes>start to use that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/786-0
02:36:51.337 --> 02:36:56.591
<v Josh Sparkes>To give a priority and maybe auto
assigned to but not set in stone,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/786-1
02:36:56.591 --> 02:37:02.386
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just a suggested person which can be
reassigned if you need to. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/786-2
02:37:02.386 --> 02:37:07.177
<v Josh Sparkes>and I think the the suggestion I think is
a a good prompt of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/787-0
02:37:07.617 --> 02:37:10.802
<v Josh Sparkes>Here's the suggestion, but don't assign.
Not important. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/787-1
02:37:10.802 --> 02:37:14.912
<v Josh Sparkes>it's more like here's the suggestion of
who could potentially pick that up as a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/787-2
02:37:14.912 --> 02:37:18.201
<v Josh Sparkes>prompt to the person that's going to be
on assignments and yes,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/787-3
02:37:18.201 --> 02:37:19.537
<v Josh Sparkes>and agree we assume. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/788-0
02:37:21.337 --> 02:37:25.768
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so these I mean these are so these are</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/788-1
02:37:25.768 --> 02:37:30.097
<v Josh Sparkes>all the categories and BIU are here, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/789-0
02:37:32.017 --> 02:37:37.057
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, so biu only you would have. Yeah,
we saw company and industry,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/789-1
02:37:37.057 --> 02:37:43.075
<v Josh Sparkes>but are they further categorised? Yeah.
So these are all the BIU categories and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/789-2
02:37:43.075 --> 02:37:49.018
<v Josh Sparkes>then they will let us know what they what
the task is all about for example is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/789-3
02:37:49.018 --> 02:37:50.297
<v Josh Sparkes>about matters or.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/790-0
02:37:50.657 --> 02:37:55.454
<v Josh Sparkes>Competitor offering or other law firms
rankings, things like that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/790-1
02:37:55.454 --> 02:38:00.036
<v Josh Sparkes>And they each different categories
involve a different SLA. OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/790-2
02:38:00.036 --> 02:38:05.692
<v Josh Sparkes>So if it would say for example you've got
sub category and that in itself is a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/790-3
02:38:05.692 --> 02:38:06.337
<v Josh Sparkes>category.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/791-0
02:38:06.857 --> 02:38:12.528
<v Josh Sparkes>Because we're just working on BIU.
So these are your categories, aren't they?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/791-1
02:38:12.528 --> 02:38:16.018
<v Josh Sparkes>So the company,
do you have like so if you take</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/791-2
02:38:16.018 --> 02:38:21.399
<v Josh Sparkes>competitor offering as a category,
is there a subcategory of that's maybe</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/791-3
02:38:21.399 --> 02:38:24.017
<v Josh Sparkes>the company one like matter related?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/792-0
02:38:24.577 --> 02:38:27.791
<v Josh Sparkes>Right.
That you can then further subcategorize</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/792-1
02:38:27.791 --> 02:38:31.484
<v Josh Sparkes>to give a priority to you were saying
that then yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/792-2
02:38:31.484 --> 02:38:37.161
<v Josh Sparkes>that's the only that's the lowest level
that we go to. Yeah. It's the subcategory.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/792-3
02:38:37.161 --> 02:38:37.777
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/793-0
02:38:39.617 --> 02:38:43.606
<v Josh Sparkes>Then share realm. Yeah, this is our. What?
The request on the form.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/793-1
02:38:43.606 --> 02:38:48.007
<v Josh Sparkes>This is on the form those labels on the
form. Yeah, this is all that they,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/793-2
02:38:48.007 --> 02:38:51.762
<v Josh Sparkes>but could they pick the next level that
is in show world today?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/793-3
02:38:51.762 --> 02:38:56.515
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean do they need to that that's all
they see and that's all they need to see.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/793-4
02:38:56.515 --> 02:38:59.097
<v Josh Sparkes>I would see. OK.
It doesn't need to be any.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/794-0
02:38:59.297 --> 02:38:59.697
<v Josh Sparkes>More than.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/795-0
02:38:59.737 --> 02:39:02.638
<v Josh Sparkes>And that,
I think even just subcategories you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/795-1
02:39:02.638 --> 02:39:05.595
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, so yes,
because we know that they're all for you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/795-2
02:39:05.595 --> 02:39:07.883
<v Josh Sparkes>anyway.
So that will be that will be the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/795-3
02:39:07.883 --> 02:39:11.454
<v Josh Sparkes>subcategory they, yeah,
other levels just because we're talking</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/795-4
02:39:11.454 --> 02:39:15.695
<v Josh Sparkes>about BIU the other like bed support.
So it depends what terminologies then</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/795-5
02:39:15.695 --> 02:39:19.322
<v Josh Sparkes>relevant to the person.
So it's high level bed support but those</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/795-6
02:39:19.322 --> 02:39:19.657
<v Josh Sparkes>other.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/796-0
02:39:19.737 --> 02:39:22.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Aspects as of that support,
that is the subcategory.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/797-0
02:39:24.817 --> 02:39:29.530
<v Josh Sparkes>It's still that support. OK, so, OK,
what are we trying to achieve here and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/797-1
02:39:29.530 --> 02:39:34.181
<v Josh Sparkes>are we trying to find out what the drop
downs will be on the form that the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/797-2
02:39:34.181 --> 02:39:37.777
<v Josh Sparkes>requestor will have for the requestor?
And at the moment,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/797-3
02:39:37.777 --> 02:39:42.676
<v Josh Sparkes>the operational form that you use is for
multi uses basically because they can</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/797-4
02:39:42.676 --> 02:39:43.297
<v Josh Sparkes>pick what?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/798-0
02:39:43.937 --> 02:39:46.876
<v Josh Sparkes>Ideally,
you're able to walk down BIU to BIU</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/798-1
02:39:46.876 --> 02:39:50.273
<v Josh Sparkes>straight.
Is that actually we're splitting these so</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/798-2
02:39:50.273 --> 02:39:55.172
<v Josh Sparkes>when BIU request that particular form
they won't need that category label.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/798-3
02:39:55.172 --> 02:39:59.025
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah that's what I'm saying that that's
that adults. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/798-4
02:39:59.025 --> 02:40:03.337
<v Josh Sparkes>And you're actually your category level.
Yeah. So you don't need.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/799-0
02:40:03.657 --> 02:40:06.917
<v Josh Sparkes>That that's enough for you.
Just that one label. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/799-1
02:40:06.917 --> 02:40:11.600
<v Josh Sparkes>so I know that those categories are via
your and I can see from the request of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/799-2
02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:15.512
<v Josh Sparkes>that it's via yours and they can just
only pick those ones. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/799-3
02:40:15.512 --> 02:40:19.187
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've just got.
So they wouldn't just waste anything else</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/799-4
02:40:19.187 --> 02:40:23.337
<v Josh Sparkes>from us. It would just be Jill.
Have you heard in the SLA enterprise?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/800-0
02:40:23.417 --> 02:40:27.123
<v Josh Sparkes>Wide discussion,
have you heard mention of displaying Slas</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/800-1
02:40:27.123 --> 02:40:31.018
<v Josh Sparkes>upfront to requesters so we could raise
that's what they see.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/800-2
02:40:31.018 --> 02:40:35.604
<v Josh Sparkes>So they see the Slas in. Yeah,
although it's to come off, yeah, I'm not.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/800-3
02:40:35.604 --> 02:40:40.755
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not sure if that was the frustration
for saying about the scenes wanting that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/800-4
02:40:40.755 --> 02:40:43.017
<v Josh Sparkes>that's something that we would show.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/801-0
02:40:43.217 --> 02:40:43.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/802-0
02:40:44.097 --> 02:40:48.055
<v Josh Sparkes>I think directors on our side are saying
that it's off putting for people and the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/802-1
02:40:48.055 --> 02:40:50.276
<v Josh Sparkes>feedback has been that when they see the
SLA,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/802-2
02:40:50.276 --> 02:40:53.559
<v Josh Sparkes>they wouldn't come to the team and ask
because they know that well,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/802-3
02:40:53.559 --> 02:40:56.746
<v Josh Sparkes>it's going to take two days to turn it
around and that's the SLA.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/802-4
02:40:56.746 --> 02:41:00.753
<v Josh Sparkes>But actually the team can turn around in
a couple of hours if we're giving all the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/802-5
02:41:00.753 --> 02:41:03.457
<v Josh Sparkes>information.
So it's it's deterring them at the minute.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/803-0
02:41:03.657 --> 02:41:06.750
<v Josh Sparkes>From using the team,
but I guess it's two edged swords.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/803-1
02:41:06.750 --> 02:41:10.285
<v Josh Sparkes>I would agree with that.
So like my guts telling me we wouldn't</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/803-2
02:41:10.285 --> 02:41:13.986
<v Josh Sparkes>display that to any of our stakeholders
from an app's perspective,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/803-3
02:41:13.986 --> 02:41:17.135
<v Josh Sparkes>particularly because it will be soft
launch SLE as well,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/803-4
02:41:17.135 --> 02:41:20.062
<v Josh Sparkes>we obviously because we don't measure
them just now.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/803-5
02:41:20.062 --> 02:41:23.377
<v Josh Sparkes>So we need to understand how they work,
we typically don't.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/804-0
02:41:23.457 --> 02:41:25.881
<v Josh Sparkes>Do that. Yeah. OK. Sorry.
One more question. Emily,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/804-1
02:41:25.881 --> 02:41:29.752
<v Josh Sparkes>you said it deters that your stakeholders
from using the team because they see the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/804-2
02:41:29.752 --> 02:41:31.990
<v Josh Sparkes>SN as what do they do then to get the job
done,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/804-3
02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:35.814
<v Josh Sparkes>if they're deterred from like speaking to
your team, they'll do it themselves or.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/804-4
02:41:35.814 --> 02:41:38.192
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, yeah,
so it's they're not using these services</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/804-5
02:41:38.192 --> 02:41:40.990
<v Josh Sparkes>in the right manner.
So it's deterring them from the use of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/804-6
02:41:40.990 --> 02:41:41.177
<v Josh Sparkes>the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/805-0
02:41:42.057 --> 02:41:44.651
<v Josh Sparkes>Basically,
it's used as a mechanism to not use the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/805-1
02:41:44.651 --> 02:41:47.856
<v Josh Sparkes>team, but uses mechanisms to say, well,
your S laser too long,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/805-2
02:41:47.856 --> 02:41:51.162
<v Josh Sparkes>so I needed done yesterday,
but actually you can't achieve that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/805-3
02:41:51.162 --> 02:41:55.130
<v Josh Sparkes>So we're we're putting ourselves in a
position and but it's a two edged sword</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/805-4
02:41:55.130 --> 02:41:56.657
<v Josh Sparkes>and that's what I'm saying is.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/806-0
02:41:56.977 --> 02:42:01.558
<v Josh Sparkes>We need to set expectations and don't
just keep delivering within that to our</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/806-1
02:42:01.558 --> 02:42:04.201
<v Josh Sparkes>window or to to protect the team in a
sense,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/806-2
02:42:04.201 --> 02:42:09.075
<v Josh Sparkes>but also that to set expectations of how
long do these tasks actually take and you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/806-3
02:42:09.075 --> 02:42:13.657
<v Josh Sparkes>get those metrics when you go live of
that start and end date, which you can.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/807-0
02:42:14.417 --> 02:42:19.642
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, so it comes so it lands with yourself.
You've got the categories that you've</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/807-1
02:42:19.642 --> 02:42:23.642
<v Josh Sparkes>seen here. And then what happens.
So it could be as you said,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/807-2
02:42:23.642 --> 02:42:29.061
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be a soft auto assigned based on
that you know you know within your scheme</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/807-3
02:42:29.061 --> 02:42:33.577
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe there's one person that runs on
legal matters or you could put.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/808-0
02:42:33.937 --> 02:42:38.479
<v Josh Sparkes>It's good skill metrics,
but it's a suggested land and then we say,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/808-1
02:42:38.479 --> 02:42:42.888
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, it's been assigned,
what do you then do with that information</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/808-2
02:42:42.888 --> 02:42:46.162
<v Josh Sparkes>show today?
How do you do enrich it further with</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/808-3
02:42:46.162 --> 02:42:51.573
<v Josh Sparkes>additional information you just start to
worry, I know generally it's all there,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/808-4
02:42:51.573 --> 02:42:53.177
<v Josh Sparkes>they just start working.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/809-0
02:42:53.257 --> 02:42:56.963
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, OK, no approval required.
It's assumed that that's you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/809-1
02:42:56.963 --> 02:43:00.779
<v Josh Sparkes>once you get the request,
you don't need any approval process in it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/809-2
02:43:00.779 --> 02:43:03.158
<v Josh Sparkes>No,
it's one of the ones that goes back to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/809-3
02:43:03.158 --> 02:43:07.473
<v Josh Sparkes>business intelligence, they review it,
provide any feedback on any additional</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/809-4
02:43:07.473 --> 02:43:08.137
<v Josh Sparkes>information.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/811-0
02:43:08.657 --> 02:43:12.465
<v Josh Sparkes>Required as part of the request,
it may have gone in some more arms and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/811-1
02:43:12.465 --> 02:43:15.692
<v Josh Sparkes>legs at that point,
but generally speaking we've got all the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/811-2
02:43:15.692 --> 02:43:19.659
<v Josh Sparkes>information up front so you can have a
checklist in there. So for example,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/811-3
02:43:19.659 --> 02:43:22.198
<v Josh Sparkes>you've checked, you know,
three or four things,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/811-4
02:43:22.198 --> 02:43:26.324
<v Josh Sparkes>but when they they receive it back or
they get a notification because they're</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/811-5
02:43:26.324 --> 02:43:28.017
<v Josh Sparkes>the requester, they've done one.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/812-0
02:43:28.097 --> 02:43:31.861
<v Josh Sparkes>1234 only the is the standard things that
you're providing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/812-1
02:43:31.861 --> 02:43:34.497
<v Josh Sparkes>You know you could populate the checklist.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/813-0
02:43:36.017 --> 02:43:40.740
<v Josh Sparkes>Not really, or in some example,
let's say when they received it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/813-1
02:43:40.740 --> 02:43:45.682
<v Josh Sparkes>So what do? What do they,
what do they then check when they receive</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/813-2
02:43:45.682 --> 02:43:46.337
<v Josh Sparkes>the task?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/814-0
02:43:47.577 --> 02:43:52.780
<v Josh Sparkes>Back to them that you've completed it.
What do they then have to do?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/814-1
02:43:52.780 --> 02:43:57.381
<v Josh Sparkes>I I don't think our checklist is why they.
I don't think so.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/814-2
02:43:57.381 --> 02:44:02.359
<v Josh Sparkes>Because sometimes as you see in the
category, sometimes they are.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/814-3
02:44:02.359 --> 02:44:07.337
<v Josh Sparkes>They asked us to like collect information
from from the Internet.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/815-0
02:44:07.417 --> 02:44:12.570
<v Josh Sparkes>The Internet on the people profiles or
exhibition project, something like that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/815-1
02:44:12.570 --> 02:44:15.985
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's quite difficult to verify those
information.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/815-2
02:44:15.985 --> 02:44:20.494
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's assumed when you've done it,
it's assumed close and complete,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/815-3
02:44:20.494 --> 02:44:25.712
<v Josh Sparkes>essentially no further cheques required.
It won't get feedback. Yeah, they will.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/815-4
02:44:25.712 --> 02:44:26.937
<v Josh Sparkes>They will probably.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/816-0
02:44:27.377 --> 02:44:32.057
<v Josh Sparkes>Some feedback? Yeah. To be in there.
If it's something. Yeah. For example,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/816-1
02:44:32.057 --> 02:44:35.178
<v Josh Sparkes>if there is like they would express,
for example,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/816-2
02:44:35.178 --> 02:44:39.672
<v Josh Sparkes>they are asking us to look for
exhibitions or seminars and then we come</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/816-3
02:44:39.672 --> 02:44:43.417
<v Josh Sparkes>back with just a handful of information
they probably like.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/817-0
02:44:44.417 --> 02:44:49.995
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you go back to to run another search
or use other parameters to run the search</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/817-1
02:44:49.995 --> 02:44:54.230
<v Josh Sparkes>to see if you you'll you'll be able to
get more more robotics,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/817-2
02:44:54.230 --> 02:44:58.599
<v Josh Sparkes>something like that you can go down a
rabbit hole with research.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/817-3
02:44:58.599 --> 02:45:03.977
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think there's there's like a time
limit that the are in parameters around.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/818-0
02:45:04.257 --> 02:45:08.739
<v Josh Sparkes>Like you can keep going and keep going,
but there needs to be a a stop,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/818-1
02:45:08.739 --> 02:45:13.347
<v Josh Sparkes>so it's about what information is
important. Is 10 seminars enough or so?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/818-2
02:45:13.347 --> 02:45:17.705
<v Josh Sparkes>So this could be somebody you know,
if it is certain as you know what</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/818-3
02:45:17.705 --> 02:45:18.577
<v Josh Sparkes>constitutes a.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/819-0
02:45:19.697 --> 02:45:24.160
<v Josh Sparkes>Completeness, as you said,
what what sort of constitutes success is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/819-1
02:45:24.160 --> 02:45:27.639
<v Josh Sparkes>a leading. It's a never ending.
You know subjective.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/819-2
02:45:27.639 --> 02:45:31.380
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes I suppose what we're saying is
that, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/819-3
02:45:31.380 --> 02:45:34.137
<v Josh Sparkes>is to provide to prevent that rabbit hole.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/820-0
02:45:35.337 --> 02:45:38.589
<v Josh Sparkes>When it goes back to,
it goes back to the team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/820-1
02:45:38.589 --> 02:45:43.672
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be that before they close
completed, we don't encourage too much,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/820-2
02:45:43.672 --> 02:45:49.365
<v Josh Sparkes>but you know they're verifying sufficient
and it's closed complete or they can give</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/820-3
02:45:49.365 --> 02:45:54.177
<v Josh Sparkes>some feedback so that the case remains
open until that loop is closed.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/821-0
02:45:54.337 --> 02:45:57.298
<v Josh Sparkes>Obviously you don't want 20 iterations of
it. I mean,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/821-1
02:45:57.298 --> 02:46:00.754
<v Josh Sparkes>how often does that happen that when you
give it back to them,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/821-2
02:46:00.754 --> 02:46:05.251
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe there's certain categories that the
number count or the people count wasn't</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/821-3
02:46:05.251 --> 02:46:08.103
<v Josh Sparkes>sufficient.
So I think probably what we get to mark</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/821-4
02:46:08.103 --> 02:46:12.217
<v Josh Sparkes>probably answers the same question,
what's the ratio of first time rights?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/822-0
02:46:12.697 --> 02:46:20.625
<v Josh Sparkes>To second time, more research is required.
I don't think we know exactly how they</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/822-1
02:46:20.625 --> 02:46:27.296
<v Josh Sparkes>draw the line. Yeah. So we depends on we,
we rely on their feedback.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/822-2
02:46:27.296 --> 02:46:31.937
<v Josh Sparkes>So sometimes they will come back to us
and say.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/823-0
02:46:32.217 --> 02:46:37.300
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, that's fine. Thank you very much.
Then then we just complete, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/823-1
02:46:37.300 --> 02:46:41.647
<v Josh Sparkes>and that close completes it.
It could be the root cause was need</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/823-2
02:46:41.647 --> 02:46:46.463
<v Josh Sparkes>additional seminars. You know,
you could you could start to have a drop</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/823-3
02:46:46.463 --> 02:46:48.537
<v Josh Sparkes>down more information requires.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/824-0
02:46:48.937 --> 02:46:54.603
<v Josh Sparkes>Additional dates to be included, you know,
expand the scope to because sometimes you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/824-1
02:46:54.603 --> 02:46:58.337
<v Josh Sparkes>ask the question research you know. Oh,
I can see that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/824-2
02:46:58.337 --> 02:47:01.870
<v Josh Sparkes>Actually what I want is this. You know,
so it might.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/824-3
02:47:01.870 --> 02:47:05.937
<v Josh Sparkes>So you could just to close that loop to
provide maybe level.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/825-0
02:47:06.337 --> 02:47:09.579
<v Josh Sparkes>One iteration,
some feedback that you need to expand it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/825-1
02:47:09.579 --> 02:47:13.981
<v Josh Sparkes>and then it becomes quote you, you,
you then get informed that this is what</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/825-2
02:47:13.981 --> 02:47:18.498
<v Josh Sparkes>is required and then you compose it or
does it get close to complete and then</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/825-3
02:47:18.498 --> 02:47:23.015
<v Josh Sparkes>they have to ask the request again or
does it stay open and you just do those</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/825-4
02:47:23.015 --> 02:47:25.737
<v Josh Sparkes>iterations?
We keep things open and time warm.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/826-0
02:47:26.217 --> 02:47:31.371
<v Josh Sparkes>More information from the like BIA team
is that it's complete and that they're</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/826-1
02:47:31.371 --> 02:47:36.199
<v Josh Sparkes>happy with the the desired outcome,
but I I think there's probably a 5050</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/826-2
02:47:36.199 --> 02:47:40.897
<v Josh Sparkes>chance that it could have that second
information or that it's a close.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/827-0
02:47:41.337 --> 02:47:44.431
<v Josh Sparkes>Actually,
to capture that second iteration as part</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/827-1
02:47:44.431 --> 02:47:49.043
<v Josh Sparkes>of the workflow and the reason why they
want that second iteration in there</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/827-2
02:47:49.043 --> 02:47:53.655
<v Josh Sparkes>before it's closed complete and we'll
probably would you say that therefore</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/827-3
02:47:53.655 --> 02:47:57.538
<v Josh Sparkes>that could be a business for that if it
required 1/3 iteration.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/827-4
02:47:57.538 --> 02:48:00.937
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean that's probably where your
research skills come.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/828-0
02:48:01.137 --> 02:48:04.011
<v Josh Sparkes>Experience tells you that this that this
is complete.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/828-1
02:48:04.011 --> 02:48:06.459
<v Josh Sparkes>That's part of your roles and
responsibility,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/828-2
02:48:06.459 --> 02:48:10.717
<v Josh Sparkes>but maybe the business was that after
after the 2nd iteration it then becomes a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/828-3
02:48:10.717 --> 02:48:14.975
<v Josh Sparkes>new request. It's a bit like a project.
I'll just start off small and then I'll</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/828-4
02:48:14.975 --> 02:48:17.530
<v Josh Sparkes>grow it.
And eventually you think that wasn't a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/828-5
02:48:17.530 --> 02:48:20.617
<v Josh Sparkes>small project that's actually just change
control to get.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/829-0
02:48:20.737 --> 02:48:24.032
<v Josh Sparkes>The larger I wouldn't say it was any more
beyond the same.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/829-1
02:48:24.032 --> 02:48:28.446
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think that's the goal of business
intelligence is to set the expectations</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/829-2
02:48:28.446 --> 02:48:32.244
<v Josh Sparkes>of what we can deliver and that's what's
then provided to the team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/829-3
02:48:32.244 --> 02:48:35.149
<v Josh Sparkes>So it is very clear around what we need
to deliver.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/829-4
02:48:35.149 --> 02:48:39.451
<v Josh Sparkes>It may only be like a few things or
something new that's come up or an event</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/829-5
02:48:39.451 --> 02:48:40.457
<v Josh Sparkes>seminar from when.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/830-0
02:48:40.497 --> 02:48:45.234
<v Josh Sparkes>The request was put in and or they want
to expand the search because there wasn't</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/830-1
02:48:45.234 --> 02:48:48.123
<v Josh Sparkes>much that had come back from that initial
search.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/830-2
02:48:48.123 --> 02:48:52.457
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're expanding the search because
it's that try to keep it contained</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/830-3
02:48:52.457 --> 02:48:56.212
<v Josh Sparkes>without going too far.
So it might be that they just extend that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/830-4
02:48:56.212 --> 02:48:59.217
<v Josh Sparkes>as a result of. Yeah. To it. Right,
you know, just.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/831-0
02:48:59.617 --> 02:49:02.880
<v Josh Sparkes>One one iteration bank and then close
complaints. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/831-1
02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:06.376
<v Josh Sparkes>it doesn't easy issue that. Yeah, OK,
that's good. Deborah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/831-2
02:49:06.376 --> 02:49:09.813
<v Josh Sparkes>are you thinking of a state while
awaiting initial review?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/831-3
02:49:09.813 --> 02:49:13.018
<v Josh Sparkes>So not not a task, no.
A state state change. Yes, yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/831-4
02:49:13.018 --> 02:49:14.417
<v Josh Sparkes>And then it either goes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/832-0
02:49:14.857 --> 02:49:17.954
<v Josh Sparkes>Well awaiting confirmation.
Essentially you're waiting,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/832-1
02:49:17.954 --> 02:49:21.438
<v Josh Sparkes>so we capture the actual time with you
guys rather than. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/832-2
02:49:21.438 --> 02:49:25.863
<v Josh Sparkes>And you can capture these metrics and
then you capture why it was incomplete or</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/832-3
02:49:25.863 --> 02:49:30.232
<v Josh Sparkes>why it requires further information.
And then I'll close complete. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/832-4
02:49:30.232 --> 02:49:34.657
<v Josh Sparkes>Then you can go back to the requester.
I don't know. Waiting confirmation then.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/833-0
02:49:34.777 --> 02:49:39.801
<v Josh Sparkes>So is there a prompt like an automation
prompt after a certain amount of time</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/833-1
02:49:39.801 --> 02:49:43.537
<v Josh Sparkes>that then trigger that if we've not had a
response? Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/833-2
02:49:43.537 --> 02:49:48.174
<v Josh Sparkes>you could do reminders for that.
That's something the team has to do is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/833-3
02:49:48.174 --> 02:49:52.297
<v Josh Sparkes>not so much the BI year,
but that there's a follow up thing of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/834-0
02:49:52.777 --> 02:49:57.024
<v Josh Sparkes>Is this actually caused for waiting?
They can get automatic reminders so it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/834-1
02:49:57.024 --> 02:49:59.651
<v Josh Sparkes>could be an hour or two hours or the same
day.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/834-2
02:49:59.651 --> 02:50:04.178
<v Josh Sparkes>Or if they haven't replied in 24 hours or
you want to close it at the end of the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/834-3
02:50:04.178 --> 02:50:06.301
<v Josh Sparkes>day,
that reminder you could set your</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/834-4
02:50:06.301 --> 02:50:10.437
<v Josh Sparkes>reminders as well so that they're not
doesn't become white noise to them,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/834-5
02:50:10.437 --> 02:50:12.617
<v Josh Sparkes>but it actually is an effective prompt.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/835-0
02:50:13.657 --> 02:50:17.452
<v Josh Sparkes>So they get that notification and then
they get that reminder.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/835-1
02:50:17.452 --> 02:50:20.284
<v Josh Sparkes>I think some of the Slas were if there's
a 72,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/835-2
02:50:20.284 --> 02:50:23.056
<v Josh Sparkes>you know soft it could be one day as it
were.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/835-3
02:50:23.056 --> 02:50:27.937
<v Josh Sparkes>And do you want to like I usually feel
personally I'm one of the annoying fears.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/836-0
02:50:28.257 --> 02:50:31.678
<v Josh Sparkes>I usually feel if it's actually closed,
I don't actually go back if it's not</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/836-1
02:50:31.678 --> 02:50:34.655
<v Josh Sparkes>closed, I'll be. Don't you worry.
I don't need. I'll be proactive.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/836-2
02:50:34.655 --> 02:50:37.055
<v Josh Sparkes>And that comes.
Do you want a cut off point to say we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/836-3
02:50:37.055 --> 02:50:39.676
<v Josh Sparkes>don't hear from you after six hours or a
day? Effectively,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/836-4
02:50:39.676 --> 02:50:42.964
<v Josh Sparkes>that's what the team are doing.
Just manually. So what they're saying is,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/836-5
02:50:42.964 --> 02:50:45.541
<v Josh Sparkes>like, so they'll do reminders of, like,
just checking in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/836-6
02:50:45.541 --> 02:50:47.897
<v Josh Sparkes>If there's anything further required on
this to sit.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/837-0
02:50:48.417 --> 02:50:51.013
<v Josh Sparkes>Our team expectations are in delivery and
then OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/837-1
02:50:51.013 --> 02:50:53.763
<v Josh Sparkes>So at this point we've we've changed you
three times.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/837-2
02:50:53.763 --> 02:50:57.633
<v Josh Sparkes>We were now saying like if we've not
heard back from you from by the end of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/837-3
02:50:57.633 --> 02:50:59.924
<v Josh Sparkes>the week,
we'll now close this case and then</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/837-4
02:50:59.924 --> 02:51:04.150
<v Josh Sparkes>shareholder can reopen that case within
the five days if there was such a need to,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/837-5
02:51:04.150 --> 02:51:06.238
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
there's a grace period on it that it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/837-6
02:51:06.238 --> 02:51:07.817
<v Josh Sparkes>effectively is the same ticket.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/838-0
02:51:07.857 --> 02:51:13.446
<v Josh Sparkes>That they can refer to. OK,
so that could be a good point from Ruth</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/838-1
02:51:13.446 --> 02:51:18.789
<v Josh Sparkes>to say that if not hers,
you can infer that actually we're going</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/838-2
02:51:18.789 --> 02:51:22.817
<v Josh Sparkes>to post a ticket. So we do that.
So maybe after.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/839-0
02:51:24.347 --> 02:51:28.837
<v Josh Sparkes>The SLA has been met. It gets closed.
Would that be a good rule to have?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/839-1
02:51:28.837 --> 02:51:33.451
<v Josh Sparkes>I think some of them are 72 hours,
so after three days from the start that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/839-2
02:51:33.451 --> 02:51:38.372
<v Josh Sparkes>was supposed to when they meant sign off
on it so that you could meet your soft</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/839-3
02:51:38.372 --> 02:51:39.787
<v Josh Sparkes>Slas in the background.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/840-0
02:51:40.657 --> 02:51:45.177
<v Josh Sparkes>You just would you want to close,
complete it at that point or give them.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/841-0
02:51:46.457 --> 02:51:50.617
<v Josh Sparkes>A day. Two days? Yeah.
Give them that case period of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/842-0
02:51:52.097 --> 02:51:56.055
<v Josh Sparkes>To come back, yeah,
based on them rather than give them the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/842-1
02:51:56.055 --> 02:52:00.871
<v Josh Sparkes>grace period. Yeah. So if it is closed,
what's the grace period on that?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/842-2
02:52:00.871 --> 02:52:06.281
<v Josh Sparkes>There are not going to close is resolved.
So we have a state called Resolve Press</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/842-3
02:52:06.281 --> 02:52:08.657
<v Josh Sparkes>to restolve and then we'll leave it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/843-0
02:52:09.417 --> 02:52:12.533
<v Josh Sparkes>Open for how long? For five days,
five days?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/843-1
02:52:12.533 --> 02:52:18.282
<v Josh Sparkes>Or is said to be to closed when the case
is actually closed. Is not OK. Great. OK,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/843-2
02:52:18.282 --> 02:52:22.714
<v Josh Sparkes>this is a resolved case.
Then they can be open during that five</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/843-3
02:52:22.714 --> 02:52:25.831
<v Josh Sparkes>day Period 5 working days.
If it's Thursday,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/843-4
02:52:25.831 --> 02:52:29.017
<v Josh Sparkes>it won't be closed on Monday.
It is Thursday.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/844-0
02:52:29.177 --> 02:52:35.871
<v Josh Sparkes>Friday and then Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, calendar day 500 calendar.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/844-1
02:52:35.871 --> 02:52:41.057
<v Josh Sparkes>Exactly. Was it just five? That plus five.
Yeah, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/845-0
02:52:45.057 --> 02:52:49.808
<v Josh Sparkes>If they go over the grace period and come
back, do they need to,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/845-1
02:52:49.808 --> 02:52:56.022
<v Josh Sparkes>like raise a new request? Yeah. OK. Yeah.
So, yeah. So that just starts again. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/845-2
02:52:56.022 --> 02:53:02.017
<v Josh Sparkes>Because the someone one of the challenges
that we have is we seldom get concrete.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/846-0
02:53:03.537 --> 02:53:07.405
<v Josh Sparkes>Complete confirmation from this requester.
Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/846-1
02:53:07.405 --> 02:53:12.695
<v Josh Sparkes>So Biu is one of the one of the
responsive requester that we have.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/846-2
02:53:12.695 --> 02:53:17.195
<v Josh Sparkes>But for other CMG,
sometimes we just deliver but then we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/846-3
02:53:17.195 --> 02:53:21.617
<v Josh Sparkes>never heard back from them even after
multiple changes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/848-0
02:53:21.657 --> 02:53:24.818
<v Josh Sparkes>Cases like doing still need anything and
I know do.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/848-1
02:53:24.818 --> 02:53:29.804
<v Josh Sparkes>Can I know do if you need anything else
and we got nothing and then we can't just</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/848-2
02:53:29.804 --> 02:53:34.364
<v Josh Sparkes>keep that ox ticket open forever.
So we just we just have to close at some</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/848-3
02:53:34.364 --> 02:53:38.985
<v Josh Sparkes>point. That's the behaviour thing as well,
isn't it? Within that, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/848-4
02:53:38.985 --> 02:53:41.417
<v Josh Sparkes>five days and that's expected that even.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/849-0
02:53:41.897 --> 02:53:48.880
<v Josh Sparkes>See to get back to say thank you. Yeah.
Would it be helpful to also link previous</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/849-1
02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:55.268
<v Josh Sparkes>cases to like a new case? So, you know,
they do go over. They're like, oh,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/849-2
02:53:55.268 --> 02:53:57.057
<v Josh Sparkes>it's related to this.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/850-0
02:53:57.337 --> 02:54:02.277
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know. Yeah,
I think we got many similar requests</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/850-1
02:54:02.277 --> 02:54:09.037
<v Josh Sparkes>recently on events. So for example,
they will send out the initial invitation</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/850-2
02:54:09.037 --> 02:54:13.457
<v Josh Sparkes>to the to the list of contact and then
after like.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/851-0
02:54:13.857 --> 02:54:19.737
<v Josh Sparkes>A week or two they would like to send a
reminder to encourage more people to sign</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/851-1
02:54:19.737 --> 02:54:23.107
<v Josh Sparkes>up, or the webinar,
or for the for the events,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/851-2
02:54:23.107 --> 02:54:28.915
<v Josh Sparkes>and they will ask us to send another wave
of the invitation to the same group of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/851-3
02:54:28.915 --> 02:54:31.497
<v Josh Sparkes>people sometimes and using the same.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/852-0
02:54:31.937 --> 02:54:38.728
<v Josh Sparkes>Invitation or the same format or the same
content and because the previous case is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/852-1
02:54:38.728 --> 02:54:42.901
<v Josh Sparkes>already closed.
So basically we'll treat this this</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/852-2
02:54:42.901 --> 02:54:47.974
<v Josh Sparkes>request as a new one,
so we need to have all the information,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/852-3
02:54:47.974 --> 02:54:51.657
<v Josh Sparkes>but sometimes they just like can you
resend?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/854-0
02:54:51.817 --> 02:54:55.268
<v Josh Sparkes>Last invitation.
That's quite difficult for us because we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/853-0
02:54:53.097 --> 02:54:53.417
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/854-1
02:54:55.268 --> 02:54:59.017
<v Josh Sparkes>need to take out all the information from.
Yeah, someone else.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/854-2
02:54:59.017 --> 02:55:02.231
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that comes back to important as
well. We are.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/854-3
02:55:02.231 --> 02:55:06.933
<v Josh Sparkes>You're you're doing the count in where
you're doing the count of the amount of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/854-4
02:55:06.933 --> 02:55:10.979
<v Josh Sparkes>cases that we're working on.
So I think that's where it does become</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/854-5
02:55:10.979 --> 02:55:11.337
<v Josh Sparkes>quite.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/856-0
02:55:11.377 --> 02:55:14.922
<v Josh Sparkes>Important around it is treated as
something differently,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/855-0
02:55:14.737 --> 02:55:15.017
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/856-1
02:55:14.922 --> 02:55:18.343
<v Josh Sparkes>but what you were saying there about the
parent child,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/856-2
02:55:18.343 --> 02:55:23.070
<v Josh Sparkes>effectively an event is the parent and
there's lots of child tasks that are</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/864-0
02:55:21.577 --> 02:55:24.204
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
we we if it helps we we do that typically</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/856-3
02:55:23.070 --> 02:55:24.377
<v Josh Sparkes>associated with AIDS.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/864-1
02:55:24.204 --> 02:55:26.995
<v Mark Sedge>within IT.
So you'll have like a parent record and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/857-0
02:55:26.057 --> 02:55:26.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/864-2
02:55:26.995 --> 02:55:30.060
<v Mark Sedge>you know sub records.
The other thing you might want to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/864-3
02:55:30.060 --> 02:55:34.383
<v Mark Sedge>consider being able to do because if it's
not just the workload record say for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/858-0
02:55:31.377 --> 02:55:31.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Call.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/859-0
02:55:33.097 --> 02:55:33.217
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/860-0
02:55:34.257 --> 02:55:34.377
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/864-4
02:55:34.383 --> 02:55:38.817
<v Mark Sedge>example you had an event and then there
was a press release as a result of that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/861-0
02:55:36.897 --> 02:55:37.017
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/862-0
02:55:37.937 --> 02:55:38.057
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/868-0
02:55:39.697 --> 02:55:43.008
<v Mark Sedge>Or something link.
You can link your record so at least</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/863-0
02:55:39.737 --> 02:55:39.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Just.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/865-0
02:55:42.017 --> 02:55:42.137
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/868-1
02:55:43.008 --> 02:55:45.610
<v Mark Sedge>you've got the story of that
communication.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/868-2
02:55:45.610 --> 02:55:48.449
<v Mark Sedge>So when you look back in time at that
activity,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/867-0
02:55:47.497 --> 02:55:47.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/868-3
02:55:48.449 --> 02:55:52.943
<v Mark Sedge>you see all of the ones in there.
So we've got the ability to to, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/868-4
02:55:52.943 --> 02:55:54.777
<v Mark Sedge>easily link associated records.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/869-0
02:55:55.537 --> 02:55:59.732
<v Josh Sparkes>And we're going to event management and
then I think probably it's.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/869-1
02:55:59.732 --> 02:56:02.509
<v Josh Sparkes>So your question was that Research
Services,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/869-2
02:56:02.509 --> 02:56:06.951
<v Josh Sparkes>when it comes back in again is linking
that request. But like you said,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/869-3
02:56:06.951 --> 02:56:11.887
<v Josh Sparkes>it probably just treated as a new request
and you can do that count and use the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/869-4
02:56:11.887 --> 02:56:14.417
<v Josh Sparkes>team to look up the previous information.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/870-0
02:56:14.977 --> 02:56:17.670
<v Josh Sparkes>And you could look at it as part of your
reports. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/870-1
02:56:17.670 --> 02:56:21.326
<v Josh Sparkes>And I think the association, for instance,
understand how that works from a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/870-2
02:56:21.326 --> 02:56:23.971
<v Josh Sparkes>reporting perspective. I mean, could be.
I mean, Mark,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/870-3
02:56:23.971 --> 02:56:27.531
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know what you think about this is
that you could be, if you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/870-4
02:56:27.531 --> 02:56:30.417
<v Josh Sparkes>it is of the same nature,
the grace period ended its close.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/871-0
02:56:30.777 --> 02:56:33.669
<v Josh Sparkes>It is a new request because they want to
raise it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/871-1
02:56:33.669 --> 02:56:38.321
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be that you could have a link to
the previous ServiceNow ticket just for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/871-2
02:56:38.321 --> 02:56:40.817
<v Josh Sparkes>referencing purposes that you can meet
and.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/876-0
02:56:39.137 --> 02:56:41.616
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. And that's what. Sorry, Debbie.
Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/876-1
02:56:41.616 --> 02:56:46.067
<v Mark Sedge>that's what I was sort of referencing
that you'd you'd still want to catch the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/872-0
02:56:43.537 --> 02:56:43.657
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/876-2
02:56:46.067 --> 02:56:48.997
<v Mark Sedge>workload.
It doesn't really matter from that point,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/873-0
02:56:46.617 --> 02:56:46.737
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/876-3
02:56:48.997 --> 02:56:52.097
<v Mark Sedge>but you would,
you would just have the link because if</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/874-0
02:56:52.057 --> 02:56:52.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/876-4
02:56:52.097 --> 02:56:56.773
<v Mark Sedge>you've got a number of iterations or you
get an ask and then you know a week later</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/876-5
02:56:56.773 --> 02:56:58.577
<v Mark Sedge>they want another communication.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/880-0
02:56:58.657 --> 02:56:58.937
<v Mark Sedge>Another.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/881-0
02:56:59.137 --> 02:57:02.263
<v Mark Sedge>Communication.
Then you can at least have the records</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/875-0
02:56:59.817 --> 02:56:59.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/881-1
02:57:02.263 --> 02:57:06.894
<v Mark Sedge>linked so that you can say all of this
was due to this one pursuit or this one.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/877-0
02:57:06.857 --> 02:57:06.977
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/881-2
02:57:06.894 --> 02:57:11.063
<v Mark Sedge>You know it's a broader piece across your
your remit. You can link you.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/881-3
02:57:11.063 --> 02:57:14.942
<v Mark Sedge>We may not have the desire to be able to
link a number of records,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/878-0
02:57:13.497 --> 02:57:13.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/879-0
02:57:14.657 --> 02:57:14.777
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/881-4
02:57:14.942 --> 02:57:18.937
<v Mark Sedge>even if they're doing different things.
That's the point I'm saying.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/882-0
02:57:19.497 --> 02:57:24.351
<v Josh Sparkes>What for referencing but in reporting
terms you would have them as 4.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/882-1
02:57:24.351 --> 02:57:28.234
<v Josh Sparkes>You know if it came back you would have 4
dissipations,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/882-2
02:57:28.234 --> 02:57:33.643
<v Josh Sparkes>but you could have a reference in there
was oh I could see that actually they</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/882-3
02:57:33.643 --> 02:57:34.337
<v Josh Sparkes>raised it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/885-0
02:57:35.537 --> 02:57:38.559
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just a reference in your own
practises,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/883-0
02:57:36.577 --> 02:57:36.977
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/885-1
02:57:38.559 --> 02:57:43.934
<v Josh Sparkes>but also from a customer perspective.
Can they not see that on a dashboard or a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/885-2
02:57:43.934 --> 02:57:47.897
<v Josh Sparkes>view of what they've and where it is and
bring it back to?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/884-0
02:57:45.617 --> 02:57:46.137
<v Mark Sedge>Yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/885-3
02:57:47.897 --> 02:57:49.577
<v Josh Sparkes>I feel then the team and.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/887-0
02:57:50.297 --> 02:57:53.961
<v Josh Sparkes>Do a little bit more handholding than
they maybe need to be doing. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/887-1
02:57:53.961 --> 02:57:57.877
<v Josh Sparkes>they see that they've requested it four
times and they could actually have to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/887-2
02:57:57.877 --> 02:58:00.136
<v Josh Sparkes>explain why they've requested it four
times.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/887-3
02:58:00.136 --> 02:58:04.202
<v Josh Sparkes>So when I get to the granular detail of
the information that I'm providing to my</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/886-0
02:58:00.777 --> 02:58:01.097
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/887-4
02:58:04.202 --> 02:58:05.257
<v Josh Sparkes>stakeholder group is.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/888-0
02:58:05.737 --> 02:58:09.098
<v Josh Sparkes>Well, actually you can see that man.
But the same question,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/888-1
02:58:09.098 --> 02:58:13.580
<v Josh Sparkes>this personal show has requested four
different publications because that's the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/888-2
02:58:13.580 --> 02:58:17.614
<v Josh Sparkes>level of detail we're going to.
And here's the name of the publication.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/888-3
02:58:17.614 --> 02:58:20.416
<v Josh Sparkes>That's for you to take that forward,
that person,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/888-4
02:58:20.416 --> 02:58:22.097
<v Josh Sparkes>that behaviour thing would be.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/889-0
02:58:22.577 --> 02:58:26.366
<v Josh Sparkes>We're seeing the same request from the
same person that's reportable.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/889-1
02:58:26.366 --> 02:58:29.668
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't think that the team need to be
Lincoln back as such,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/889-2
02:58:29.668 --> 02:58:33.512
<v Josh Sparkes>I feel like we're then hand it was just
if you wanted to put a ticket,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/889-3
02:58:33.512 --> 02:58:36.490
<v Josh Sparkes>you know as you start to use the system,
you'd be, oh,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/889-4
02:58:36.490 --> 02:58:39.954
<v Josh Sparkes>it be good handy that I could just click
it and it opens it up.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/889-5
02:58:39.954 --> 02:58:42.337
<v Josh Sparkes>But but in terms of as you said,
behaviour.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/892-0
02:58:42.417 --> 02:58:46.115
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're asking it four or five times
and we treat, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/892-1
02:58:46.115 --> 02:58:49.814
<v Josh Sparkes>treating each one as if it's a new
request, but actually isn't.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/890-0
02:58:48.897 --> 02:58:49.177
<v Mark Sedge>Better.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/892-2
02:58:49.814 --> 02:58:53.224
<v Josh Sparkes>It's the same one,
but we're getting asked multiple times.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/892-3
02:58:53.224 --> 02:58:57.617
<v Josh Sparkes>And even if you like that behaviour,
even if you like them just separately.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/891-0
02:58:53.657 --> 02:58:53.777
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/893-0
02:58:54.857 --> 02:58:58.777
<v Mark Sedge>And if it and if it helps,
if you do have it as a if you.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/894-0
02:58:58.017 --> 02:59:00.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you hold on the separately? Yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/897-0
02:59:00.937 --> 02:59:05.253
<v Mark Sedge>If you do have it as an in its own field,
what ServiceNow can do is it can enable</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/895-0
02:59:04.777 --> 02:59:04.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/897-1
02:59:05.253 --> 02:59:09.253
<v Mark Sedge>you to just hover over and view the
record without really having to open it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/897-2
02:59:09.253 --> 02:59:12.043
<v Mark Sedge>completely.
So if you do have linked records and say</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/896-0
02:59:10.177 --> 02:59:10.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/897-3
02:59:12.043 --> 02:59:16.201
<v Mark Sedge>you wanted to refer back and you've done
the association rather than having to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/897-4
02:59:16.201 --> 02:59:20.097
<v Mark Sedge>leave the record you're in to go look for
it within that record, you can.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/899-0
02:59:20.177 --> 02:59:23.954
<v Mark Sedge>Hover over and it'll give you some of the
content of that record so we could look</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/899-1
02:59:23.954 --> 02:59:27.639
<v Mark Sedge>at that as a as a requirement and then
show you how it sort of works and see if</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/898-0
02:59:25.417 --> 02:59:25.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/899-2
02:59:27.639 --> 02:59:28.377
<v Mark Sedge>it's beneficial.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/901-0
02:59:29.377 --> 02:59:31.796
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
I mean it's not matching and merging them</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/901-1
02:59:31.796 --> 02:59:36.030
<v Josh Sparkes>into one. You know it's not flat purposes.
What I'm thinking is though you probably</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/901-2
02:59:36.030 --> 02:59:38.449
<v Josh Sparkes>do want them linked because in Mandy's
example,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/900-0
02:59:37.977 --> 02:59:38.777
<v Mark Sedge>I would like them.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/901-3
02:59:38.449 --> 02:59:42.632
<v Josh Sparkes>you've come in and asked for the research.
They've not done what they've needed to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/901-4
02:59:42.632 --> 02:59:46.211
<v Josh Sparkes>do. They've been followed up and what?
Well, actually the example was,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/901-5
02:59:46.211 --> 02:59:48.177
<v Josh Sparkes>I want you to resend that invite again.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/903-0
02:59:48.497 --> 02:59:52.935
<v Josh Sparkes>You're not doing all the work to create
the invite that you did the first time.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/903-1
02:59:52.935 --> 02:59:57.151
<v Josh Sparkes>You're just basically lifting it and
resending it. You want your link goes?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/902-0
02:59:56.657 --> 02:59:56.857
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/903-2
02:59:57.151 --> 03:00:00.924
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that not what we're saying?
But the parent being there, I think.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/903-3
03:00:00.924 --> 03:00:04.752
<v Josh Sparkes>And then you've got yourself because
it'll be linked to the parents.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/903-4
03:00:04.752 --> 03:00:08.137
<v Josh Sparkes>So that would be the link that's for the
event, I think for.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/905-0
03:00:08.417 --> 03:00:12.308
<v Josh Sparkes>For business intelligence,
like in that we don't have that, yes,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/905-1
03:00:12.308 --> 03:00:17.218
<v Josh Sparkes>there's only one person, one integration.
Come back what you have and then, yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/904-0
03:00:14.457 --> 03:00:15.177
<v Mark Sedge>But you could.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/905-2
03:00:17.218 --> 03:00:20.392
<v Josh Sparkes>you could.
But I think for the where it ends whereas</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/905-3
03:00:20.392 --> 03:00:24.942
<v Josh Sparkes>events I think if we're talking like
parent child it would be associated is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/905-4
03:00:24.942 --> 03:00:27.817
<v Josh Sparkes>what we're saying.
But actually for other yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/907-0
03:00:29.417 --> 03:00:33.075
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I think for Research Services,
as you said, same person,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/907-1
03:00:33.075 --> 03:00:37.140
<v Josh Sparkes>same publication multiple times,
you want to report upon that and you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/907-2
03:00:37.140 --> 03:00:41.263
<v Josh Sparkes>could link it just because FY,
but it will be reported on four or five</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/907-3
03:00:41.263 --> 03:00:44.167
<v Josh Sparkes>times. Yeah, it wouldn't do that.
Submerged yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/907-4
03:00:44.167 --> 03:00:46.897
<v Josh Sparkes>each instance rather than and that just
shows.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/906-0
03:00:46.737 --> 03:00:46.857
<v Mark Sedge>The.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/908-0
03:00:47.937 --> 03:00:55.340
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. And in event management,
you would have the back most sub tasks.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/908-1
03:00:55.340 --> 03:01:00.137
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mark, do you want to?
Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/909-0
03:00:57.457 --> 03:01:01.997
<v Mark Sedge>For the for the research one the the is
there. Sorry, Debra, just if I may,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/909-1
03:01:01.997 --> 03:01:06.777
<v Mark Sedge>the research one there's you may get it
where they haven't the requester hasn't</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/909-2
03:01:06.777 --> 03:01:11.198
<v Mark Sedge>thought about all the parameters and then
you get iterations, iterations,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/909-3
03:01:11.198 --> 03:01:15.859
<v Mark Sedge>iterations of the same sort of context
there is are we agreeing or did I hear</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/909-4
03:01:15.859 --> 03:01:16.337
<v Mark Sedge>correct.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/911-0
03:01:16.377 --> 03:01:19.540
<v Mark Sedge>Directly that linking those records will
be useful as well,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/911-1
03:01:19.540 --> 03:01:23.653
<v Mark Sedge>because you want to go back to that
individual to say you need to be thinking</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/911-2
03:01:23.653 --> 03:01:27.977
<v Mark Sedge>fully about what you're asking for so we
don't have so many iterate iterations to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/910-0
03:01:27.177 --> 03:01:27.297
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/911-3
03:01:27.977 --> 03:01:30.297
<v Mark Sedge>get to the outcome.
Or does that not occur?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/913-0
03:01:31.257 --> 03:01:33.332
<v Josh Sparkes>No.
So ever the events that's correct Mark.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/913-1
03:01:33.332 --> 03:01:37.106
<v Josh Sparkes>So the view would be that we want to run
an event and the planning of the event</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/913-2
03:01:37.106 --> 03:01:39.182
<v Josh Sparkes>needs to happen in all those
subcategories.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/913-3
03:01:39.182 --> 03:01:41.446
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it was just research. Yeah,
I think so.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/913-4
03:01:41.446 --> 03:01:45.220
<v Josh Sparkes>It's in the context of research what
you're saying, Mark is changing behaviour.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/913-5
03:01:45.220 --> 03:01:48.617
<v Josh Sparkes>They ask the right question first time.
Presumably, I think there's up.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/912-0
03:01:47.697 --> 03:01:49.377
<v Mark Sedge>Correct. Yeah, exactly that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/914-0
03:01:49.097 --> 03:01:49.217
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/917-0
03:01:50.577 --> 03:01:54.853
<v Josh Sparkes>From research. Yeah. Yeah.
And we understand. We develop our. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/917-1
03:01:54.853 --> 03:01:58.501
<v Josh Sparkes>there may be one intonation. Yeah,
5050 times we go back.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/917-2
03:01:58.501 --> 03:02:02.464
<v Josh Sparkes>I think in majority of cases. Well,
it's 50% first time rates,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/917-3
03:02:02.464 --> 03:02:07.244
<v Josh Sparkes>the other 50% one iteration. Yeah,
it's complete. They're not getting more.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/915-0
03:02:06.177 --> 03:02:08.257
<v Mark Sedge>OK. Yeah, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/917-4
03:02:07.244 --> 03:02:08.817
<v Josh Sparkes>See if we're getting one.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/916-0
03:02:09.617 --> 03:02:10.057
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/918-0
03:02:09.617 --> 03:02:14.146
<v Josh Sparkes>So and volumes are low,
database is a little different story.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/918-1
03:02:14.146 --> 03:02:19.699
<v Josh Sparkes>So should we go to PRI mean it could be
that we get through PR and then PR.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/918-2
03:02:19.699 --> 03:02:25.033
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry just one quick question.
I don't know if we talked about this or I</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/918-3
03:02:25.033 --> 03:02:28.759
<v Josh Sparkes>missed this,
but when you have the outputs for the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/918-4
03:02:28.759 --> 03:02:29.417
<v Josh Sparkes>research.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/919-0
03:02:29.817 --> 03:02:34.785
<v Josh Sparkes>With this being like a document and then
do you like attach in the attaching the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/919-1
03:02:34.785 --> 03:02:37.668
<v Josh Sparkes>chat?
Would that be the case or you can attach</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/919-2
03:02:37.668 --> 03:02:40.490
<v Josh Sparkes>in the chat,
send information by usually in a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/919-3
03:02:40.490 --> 03:02:44.845
<v Josh Sparkes>PowerPoint attachment? Yeah,
you can put that in the you still chat in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/919-4
03:02:44.845 --> 03:02:48.587
<v Josh Sparkes>your review link it.
So I'm just thinking of where it should</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/919-5
03:02:48.587 --> 03:02:49.017
<v Josh Sparkes>reside.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/920-0
03:02:50.817 --> 03:02:54.212
<v Josh Sparkes>No. Well,
we we attach the attachment in the share</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/920-1
03:02:54.212 --> 03:02:57.939
<v Josh Sparkes>work share work case.
When we send an actual PowerPoint</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/920-2
03:02:57.939 --> 03:03:01.334
<v Josh Sparkes>attachment. Yeah,
it's not like saved on I manager</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/920-3
03:03:01.334 --> 03:03:04.463
<v Josh Sparkes>SharePoint for example.
And you put a link in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/920-4
03:03:04.463 --> 03:03:09.057
<v Josh Sparkes>So for legal for the research they have a
Central Library that they.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/921-0
03:03:09.097 --> 03:03:12.318
<v Josh Sparkes>They will pull from,
so they'll save that more centrally on</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/921-1
03:03:12.318 --> 03:03:15.809
<v Josh Sparkes>their side and they'll pull from that as
and when with research.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/921-2
03:03:15.809 --> 03:03:19.031
<v Josh Sparkes>Obviously it goes out of date,
so it needs to be refreshed.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/921-3
03:03:19.031 --> 03:03:23.219
<v Josh Sparkes>So there is that continuation of having
to go back and revisit to refresh the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/921-4
03:03:23.219 --> 03:03:25.636
<v Josh Sparkes>data,
but that's what they're in question of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/921-5
03:03:25.636 --> 03:03:28.697
<v Josh Sparkes>you that you're doing that and then
you're attaching it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/923-0
03:03:29.697 --> 03:03:33.579
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So it can be attached and then yeah,
and the storage purposes,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/923-1
03:03:33.579 --> 03:03:37.180
<v Josh Sparkes>you know at that point,
it could be removed from the attachment</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/923-2
03:03:37.180 --> 03:03:41.457
<v Josh Sparkes>in service now I mean or it could be,
you know revised there was supporting</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/923-3
03:03:41.457 --> 03:03:44.777
<v Josh Sparkes>evidence. I mean Mark,
you might have a different view on.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/925-0
03:03:45.097 --> 03:03:48.413
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, as it's growing,
this is doesn't from the library.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/924-0
03:03:48.057 --> 03:03:49.137
<v Mark Sedge>I think I think that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/925-1
03:03:48.413 --> 03:03:52.436
<v Josh Sparkes>If once they receive that research,
it's then removed from the tickets or</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/925-2
03:03:52.436 --> 03:03:56.731
<v Josh Sparkes>supporting evidence that tickets and that
whether you need to refer to it ever</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/925-3
03:03:56.731 --> 03:04:00.319
<v Josh Sparkes>again after it's done. I mean,
it's probably not a bad thing with</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/925-4
03:04:00.319 --> 03:04:03.146
<v Josh Sparkes>research,
but I would say it would still need to be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/925-5
03:04:03.146 --> 03:04:04.777
<v Josh Sparkes>associated with it everywhere.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/926-0
03:04:04.857 --> 03:04:09.624
<v Josh Sparkes>To do any like retrospective checking,
I'm thinking from business assurance</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/926-1
03:04:09.624 --> 03:04:14.016
<v Josh Sparkes>perspective that we deliver.
If you guys were going to go on and do a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/926-2
03:04:14.016 --> 03:04:18.156
<v Josh Sparkes>retro that we delivered that element,
everyone was setting, yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/927-0
03:04:14.737 --> 03:04:19.739
<v Mark Sedge>What? What you could do is have the link.
You could have the link to where it's</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/926-3
03:04:18.156 --> 03:04:19.537
<v Josh Sparkes>so where it gets lost.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/927-1
03:04:19.739 --> 03:04:20.177
<v Mark Sedge>stored.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/929-0
03:04:20.897 --> 03:04:24.728
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think Jimmy internally,
do you store those documents any more</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/929-1
03:04:24.728 --> 03:04:28.101
<v Josh Sparkes>than an internal?
So as soon as it's saying it's just out.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/929-2
03:04:28.101 --> 03:04:31.761
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you were to go back and get that
document for any reason,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/929-3
03:04:31.761 --> 03:04:34.677
<v Josh Sparkes>you would have to go through a share
relevant, OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/928-0
03:04:33.177 --> 03:04:33.417
<v Mark Sedge>So.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/929-4
03:04:34.677 --> 03:04:37.537
<v Josh Sparkes>So they don't have a straight place but
but yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/934-0
03:04:38.217 --> 03:04:41.025
<v Mark Sedge>And do you do?
I'm assuming it'll get stored with a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/930-0
03:04:38.497 --> 03:04:39.217
<v Josh Sparkes>It's research.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/934-1
03:04:41.025 --> 03:04:44.320
<v Mark Sedge>controlled document reference,
sort of or something similar.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/932-0
03:04:43.297 --> 03:04:43.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/934-2
03:04:44.320 --> 03:04:48.695
<v Mark Sedge>So would you be able to just record when
you close the ticket and that you would</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/933-0
03:04:46.137 --> 03:04:46.377
<v Josh Sparkes>Put.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/934-3
03:04:48.695 --> 03:04:52.692
<v Mark Sedge>you be able to record the reference or
would you have a hyperlink to that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/934-4
03:04:52.692 --> 03:04:54.097
<v Mark Sedge>storage space or whatever?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/935-0
03:04:54.377 --> 03:04:56.498
<v Josh Sparkes>No,
it's done on the business intelligence</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/935-1
03:04:56.498 --> 03:04:59.112
<v Josh Sparkes>side, mark.
So it's not we don't have access to that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/935-2
03:04:59.112 --> 03:05:01.973
<v Josh Sparkes>central repository that they they hold,
but they do that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/935-3
03:05:01.973 --> 03:05:04.291
<v Josh Sparkes>So they take from sharing all that
attachment,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/935-4
03:05:04.291 --> 03:05:06.857
<v Josh Sparkes>they take it and they put it in central
repository.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/938-0
03:05:06.537 --> 03:05:09.714
<v Mark Sedge>So in essence it's duplicate.
So it's the storage duplicate.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/938-1
03:05:09.714 --> 03:05:12.684
<v Mark Sedge>Or do you go into Cherwell and then
delete it after the?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/936-0
03:05:11.697 --> 03:05:11.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Please.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/938-2
03:05:12.684 --> 03:05:16.331
<v Mark Sedge>Otherwise you just fill it,
fill up your storage in the in one system</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/937-0
03:05:15.697 --> 03:05:16.777
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't hear anything.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/938-3
03:05:16.331 --> 03:05:17.217
<v Mark Sedge>and duplicate it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/939-0
03:05:18.617 --> 03:05:23.565
<v Josh Sparkes>You don't do anything and it could be
probably what probably you're alluding to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/939-1
03:05:23.565 --> 03:05:27.771
<v Josh Sparkes>is that the attachment is on the time
stamped when they extract it,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/939-2
03:05:27.771 --> 03:05:31.173
<v Josh Sparkes>time stamped,
so you get this metric if you're talking</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/939-3
03:05:31.173 --> 03:05:36.059
<v Josh Sparkes>about audit and then at that point they
might do a linked reference if they if</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/939-4
03:05:36.059 --> 03:05:37.297
<v Josh Sparkes>they wanted to just.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/940-0
03:05:37.697 --> 03:05:41.970
<v Josh Sparkes>So that point of service now is your
central repository of this topic.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/940-1
03:05:41.970 --> 03:05:44.919
<v Josh Sparkes>You know you're using it to manage the
workflow,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/940-2
03:05:44.919 --> 03:05:49.312
<v Josh Sparkes>giving that document over to business
intelligence in which then they're</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/940-3
03:05:49.312 --> 03:05:53.826
<v Josh Sparkes>extracting it and then storing it.
So it sounds like it's probably because</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/940-4
03:05:53.826 --> 03:05:57.257
<v Josh Sparkes>it's going out of date or maybe a
thumbnail is included.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/943-0
03:05:57.537 --> 03:06:01.320
<v Josh Sparkes>From it,
but actually it's taken off the workflow</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/943-1
03:06:01.320 --> 03:06:05.255
<v Josh Sparkes>once they received it.
So I think that makes sense.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/943-2
03:06:05.255 --> 03:06:11.309
<v Josh Sparkes>But the challenge is that if these guys
ever had to access that document again,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/941-0
03:06:09.897 --> 03:06:10.937
<v Mark Sedge>You could PDF.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/943-3
03:06:11.309 --> 03:06:16.607
<v Josh Sparkes>removed it from ServiceNow,
then they would meet this intelligent and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/942-0
03:06:14.337 --> 03:06:15.497
<v Mark Sedge>And that's where I was asked.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/943-4
03:06:16.607 --> 03:06:17.137
<v Josh Sparkes>that's.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/944-0
03:06:17.457 --> 03:06:21.385
<v Josh Sparkes>Check when it's resolved or they're doing
their cheques.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/944-1
03:06:21.385 --> 03:06:26.486
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm going to close complete it,
but I don't want any more iterations then</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/944-2
03:06:26.486 --> 03:06:29.657
<v Josh Sparkes>the reference of where it's stored is
linked.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/947-0
03:06:30.817 --> 03:06:33.836
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
what we need to protect ourselves from is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/947-1
03:06:33.836 --> 03:06:38.239
<v Mark Sedge>having heavy, heavy loading service.
Now just doing document storage,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/947-2
03:06:38.239 --> 03:06:43.523
<v Mark Sedge>because if they're depending on depending
on what they are, if they're PowerPoints,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/945-0
03:06:39.377 --> 03:06:42.737
<v Josh Sparkes>When is the place next in so that here?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/947-3
03:06:43.523 --> 03:06:46.417
<v Mark Sedge>you know they might be quite heavy
documents.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/946-0
03:06:45.537 --> 03:06:45.657
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/950-0
03:06:46.737 --> 03:06:50.133
<v Mark Sedge>But the alternative is that you, you know,
they get the PowerPoint,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/948-0
03:06:49.417 --> 03:06:49.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/950-1
03:06:50.133 --> 03:06:53.480
<v Mark Sedge>you get PDF which lightens the load of
the of what you get stored.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/949-0
03:06:53.057 --> 03:06:53.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/950-2
03:06:53.480 --> 03:06:57.376
<v Mark Sedge>But you can kind of see the content.
It's that sort of thing we need to think</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/950-3
03:06:57.376 --> 03:06:59.823
<v Mark Sedge>about,
which is why I was saying that if it's in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/950-4
03:06:59.823 --> 03:07:03.569
<v Mark Sedge>a document store with a reference number,
the requester could give you the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/950-5
03:07:03.569 --> 03:07:06.217
<v Mark Sedge>reference number.
So if you look back in the record.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/951-0
03:07:06.257 --> 03:07:08.577
<v Mark Sedge>But you've got a route to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/953-0
03:07:08.417 --> 03:07:11.369
<v Josh Sparkes>And we don't have access mark and I get
that right.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/953-1
03:07:11.369 --> 03:07:15.910
<v Josh Sparkes>Again what you are saying around that
document storage piece is probably just a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/953-2
03:07:15.910 --> 03:07:18.976
<v Josh Sparkes>question mark of how we deal with that
sort of stuff.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/952-0
03:07:17.337 --> 03:07:17.737
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/953-3
03:07:18.976 --> 03:07:23.177
<v Josh Sparkes>It gives a challenge access to it.
Could you gain access to that area so?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/954-0
03:07:23.697 --> 03:07:26.373
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it more about that we're using that as
a reference?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/954-1
03:07:26.373 --> 03:07:30.218
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just trying to understand why we're
well, I guess, why are we deleting it?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/954-2
03:07:30.218 --> 03:07:34.258
<v Josh Sparkes>And then if we need to use that template
or that similar format as the expectation</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/954-3
03:07:34.258 --> 03:07:37.908
<v Josh Sparkes>then on business intelligence to then
upload that was providing and always</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/954-4
03:07:37.908 --> 03:07:41.753
<v Josh Sparkes>provide that because that feels like
extra effort and workload on the on their</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/954-5
03:07:41.753 --> 03:07:43.457
<v Josh Sparkes>side, yeah, to then work with them.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/955-0
03:07:43.737 --> 03:07:48.046
<v Josh Sparkes>How often? OK, I suppose so.
Isn't your central repository of content</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/955-1
03:07:48.046 --> 03:07:52.725
<v Josh Sparkes>management as it was the workflow of and
also having a look at performance,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/955-2
03:07:52.725 --> 03:07:57.466
<v Josh Sparkes>you know if you load it down a bit like
running with heavy wipes around your</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/955-3
03:07:57.466 --> 03:08:00.421
<v Josh Sparkes>ankles,
the more you load it with documents you</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/955-4
03:08:00.421 --> 03:08:03.377
<v Josh Sparkes>know it is a, you know,
convenient performance.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/956-0
03:08:03.577 --> 03:08:05.898
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's what my question is. Again,
right.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/956-1
03:08:05.898 --> 03:08:09.921
<v Josh Sparkes>So when you guys are working on those
PowerPoints and your team before you're</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/956-2
03:08:09.921 --> 03:08:14.099
<v Josh Sparkes>sending it, could you see even that work?
Is it individually on your own drives?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/956-3
03:08:14.099 --> 03:08:17.606
<v Josh Sparkes>Have you got it in a shared drive? Yeah,
no, it's not stored. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/956-4
03:08:17.606 --> 03:08:21.423
<v Josh Sparkes>And then it's goes into share mode and
that's that. So it's going to the,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/956-5
03:08:21.423 --> 03:08:23.177
<v Josh Sparkes>could you have a shared area with?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/957-0
03:08:23.257 --> 03:08:26.147
<v Josh Sparkes>They go so we have.
We've shared like templates or best</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/957-1
03:08:26.147 --> 03:08:28.779
<v Josh Sparkes>practise,
but the information was out of date like</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/957-2
03:08:28.779 --> 03:08:32.133
<v Josh Sparkes>financial information was out of date.
Research was out of date.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/957-3
03:08:32.133 --> 03:08:35.746
<v Josh Sparkes>If you were to format them,
could you have your own area where a copy</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/957-4
03:08:35.746 --> 03:08:38.636
<v Josh Sparkes>of that under the eyes.
So you can always reference it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/957-5
03:08:38.636 --> 03:08:42.817
<v Josh Sparkes>So we need to be careful because it was
client information. Then it is the iMac.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/960-0
03:08:43.017 --> 03:08:46.004
<v Josh Sparkes>It can't be get stored on like clouds and
SharePoint.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/960-1
03:08:46.004 --> 03:08:49.933
<v Josh Sparkes>So then there becomes the client
restrictions you see in the document.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/958-0
03:08:48.017 --> 03:08:48.577
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/960-2
03:08:49.933 --> 03:08:53.253
<v Josh Sparkes>Could you gain access?
You know there's privileges in other</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/960-3
03:08:53.253 --> 03:08:56.794
<v Josh Sparkes>content areas. Could you?
I mean it's probably worth don't know</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/960-4
03:08:56.794 --> 03:09:01.110
<v Josh Sparkes>that we'll get a solution just that is
actually The thing is probably a wider</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/959-0
03:08:59.777 --> 03:09:02.417
<v Mark Sedge>Can I suggest can I suggest we park?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/960-5
03:09:01.110 --> 03:09:02.217
<v Josh Sparkes>they've been having.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/963-0
03:09:02.897 --> 03:09:07.438
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, exactly. I've got that well,
so you could do it in the parking lot and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/963-1
03:09:07.438 --> 03:09:12.157
<v Josh Sparkes>we take it enterprise label because I
imagine there we have lots of PowerPoints</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/961-0
03:09:08.777 --> 03:09:09.337
<v Mark Sedge>Yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/963-2
03:09:12.157 --> 03:09:16.581
<v Josh Sparkes>and documents that we are sharing would
share centrally. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/962-0
03:09:15.737 --> 03:09:16.057
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/963-3
03:09:16.581 --> 03:09:21.241
<v Josh Sparkes>So is this a high load request? Yeah.
Are you going to load the system now for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/963-4
03:09:21.241 --> 03:09:22.657
<v Josh Sparkes>performance if it comes?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/964-0
03:09:22.897 --> 03:09:25.556
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So what I'll say then is the 19 to deal</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/964-1
03:09:25.556 --> 03:09:29.893
<v Josh Sparkes>with documents pretty much newly with
every request. Yeah. So that's yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/964-2
03:09:29.893 --> 03:09:34.576
<v Josh Sparkes>it's high volume of its storage and we're
thinking about performance and storage</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/964-3
03:09:34.576 --> 03:09:39.143
<v Josh Sparkes>from the system perspective as there's a
lot that a lot of it then goes out of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/964-4
03:09:39.143 --> 03:09:41.977
<v Josh Sparkes>date of and that's and that's fine
transferring.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/965-0
03:09:42.897 --> 03:09:47.330
<v Josh Sparkes>That it's where it it lives as it's. Yeah.
And it's not going to do like and I</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/965-1
03:09:47.330 --> 03:09:50.135
<v Josh Sparkes>manage or like if we do need to save
things down.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/965-2
03:09:50.135 --> 03:09:54.513
<v Josh Sparkes>If I think for like directories and
awards things are more essentially stored</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/965-3
03:09:54.513 --> 03:09:58.946
<v Josh Sparkes>but when it's things that are like out
the door that will change probably next</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/965-4
03:09:58.946 --> 03:10:02.257
<v Josh Sparkes>month that no it's not stored in a
location that's shared.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/966-0
03:10:02.617 --> 03:10:06.292
<v Josh Sparkes>It's more templates that are shared
within like teams,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/966-1
03:10:06.292 --> 03:10:10.636
<v Josh Sparkes>channels and finals that we as a team
share or I manage as well.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/966-2
03:10:10.636 --> 03:10:14.512
<v Josh Sparkes>We're reusing templates that have been
blocked out there.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/966-3
03:10:14.512 --> 03:10:18.857
<v Josh Sparkes>OK we can take that so wide.
And how often do you refer to them?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/967-0
03:10:19.377 --> 03:10:23.664
<v Josh Sparkes>After they're sent, you know, as you said,
there's an additional process where we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/967-1
03:10:23.664 --> 03:10:27.586
<v Josh Sparkes>have to go back and look at them.
How often is that on the percentage ones</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/967-2
03:10:27.586 --> 03:10:31.351
<v Josh Sparkes>that you send finally? Well, yeah,
retrospective is obviously something</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/967-3
03:10:31.351 --> 03:10:34.175
<v Josh Sparkes>that's coming up,
but it's more if we're so we do and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/967-4
03:10:34.175 --> 03:10:37.783
<v Josh Sparkes>there's label quality cheques and
processorship and we'll do monthly</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/967-5
03:10:37.783 --> 03:10:38.777
<v Josh Sparkes>business this year.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/968-0
03:10:39.057 --> 03:10:43.866
<v Josh Sparkes>Cheques, which are retrospective cheques,
so not the live ones that happen in that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/968-1
03:10:43.866 --> 03:10:48.444
<v Josh Sparkes>process. More retrospective check in.
So if we are doing quality cheques we'll</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/968-2
03:10:48.444 --> 03:10:51.921
<v Josh Sparkes>quality check the process from start to
finish the request.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/968-3
03:10:51.921 --> 03:10:54.297
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll need to see all those documents.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/970-0
03:10:54.617 --> 03:10:57.857
<v Josh Sparkes>If they're not stored somewhere centrally
at the moment,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/970-1
03:10:57.857 --> 03:11:00.983
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll get the amount of share amount. OK,
that's good.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/970-2
03:11:00.983 --> 03:11:04.450
<v Josh Sparkes>Check from those ones that you send for
the request matters.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/970-3
03:11:04.450 --> 03:11:08.884
<v Josh Sparkes>You don't you don't have that quality
check that the same checkpoints that we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/969-0
03:11:06.297 --> 03:11:06.417
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/970-4
03:11:08.884 --> 03:11:12.294
<v Josh Sparkes>discussed earlier,
the effect of the the reason behind that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/970-5
03:11:12.294 --> 03:11:14.057
<v Josh Sparkes>is the effect where we need to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/971-0
03:11:14.177 --> 03:11:17.911
<v Josh Sparkes>We do the research,
then we need to do the task again. Right.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/971-1
03:11:17.911 --> 03:11:22.490
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. So new work in progress. Close,
complete with that iteration thing that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/971-2
03:11:22.490 --> 03:11:26.104
<v Josh Sparkes>we said plus the resolve and the grace
period of five days.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/971-3
03:11:26.104 --> 03:11:29.177
<v Josh Sparkes>So they get cancelled.
Just closing out cancelled.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/972-0
03:11:30.257 --> 03:11:33.675
<v Josh Sparkes>No, I'm not saying that really.
But you've got the option from your</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/972-1
03:11:33.675 --> 03:11:37.847
<v Josh Sparkes>question to maybe raise it as cancelled
when it goes account posed incomplete. No,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/972-2
03:11:37.847 --> 03:11:41.567
<v Josh Sparkes>not element of ours might be cancelled
and the other aspect that business</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/972-3
03:11:41.567 --> 03:11:45.588
<v Josh Sparkes>intelligence are working on this that may
continue so that that can happen. OK,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/972-4
03:11:45.588 --> 03:11:48.805
<v Josh Sparkes>that can happen. Yeah.
And it will say that we don't already do</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/972-5
03:11:48.805 --> 03:11:49.057
<v Josh Sparkes>that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/973-0
03:11:49.377 --> 03:11:58.748
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, like us, we still have the option.
Alex, did you want to? We both. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/973-1
03:11:58.748 --> 03:11:59.697
<v Josh Sparkes>OK yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/976-0
03:12:10.937 --> 03:12:16.552
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, there will be. They will.
Research matters. Yeah. Research matters.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/976-1
03:12:16.552 --> 03:12:20.422
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah.
Or manage research because of service,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/976-2
03:12:20.422 --> 03:12:21.257
<v Josh Sparkes>as it were.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/977-0
03:12:22.017 --> 03:12:26.697
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah. Should we go on space?
We'll probably this is.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/978-0
03:12:28.817 --> 03:12:33.032
<v Josh Sparkes>Now I was thinking that this might be a
subset of events.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/978-1
03:12:33.032 --> 03:12:39.064
<v Josh Sparkes>It just wanted to sort of get a handle on
all of these directories coordination of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/978-2
03:12:39.064 --> 03:12:39.937
<v Josh Sparkes>directories.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/979-0
03:12:41.337 --> 03:12:45.487
<v Josh Sparkes>Directors interviews,
historical directors, submission reports.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/979-1
03:12:45.487 --> 03:12:49.507
<v Josh Sparkes>There's probably OK.
This is just the most awful process. Oh,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/979-2
03:12:49.507 --> 03:12:53.982
<v Josh Sparkes>they're the worst process.
Do you need lunch to get through these or</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/979-3
03:12:53.982 --> 03:12:58.002
<v Josh Sparkes>should we try and get them done and then
celebrate the lunch?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/979-4
03:12:58.002 --> 03:13:00.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Start with directories. That's fine.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/980-0
03:13:01.417 --> 03:13:06.418
<v Josh Sparkes>It's so you've got briefing of them.
Coordination of them.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/980-1
03:13:06.418 --> 03:13:12.777
<v Josh Sparkes>Have you just given an underview of?
Is there a happy path of directories?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/981-0
03:13:14.137 --> 03:13:17.437
<v Josh Sparkes>Or what are they? I mean,
what if you were to summarise what they</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/981-1
03:13:17.437 --> 03:13:20.037
<v Josh Sparkes>are in terms of how that you do the work
with them?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/981-2
03:13:20.037 --> 03:13:22.137
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe you can give us an overview of that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/983-0
03:13:23.577 --> 03:13:30.068
<v Josh Sparkes>Without calling, it sounds OK.
Directories are how the pharmacy across</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/983-1
03:13:30.068 --> 03:13:35.919
<v Josh Sparkes>the two main directory providers,
being chambers and legal 500.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/983-2
03:13:35.919 --> 03:13:38.297
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a policy in place.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/984-0
03:13:39.577 --> 03:13:44.446
<v Josh Sparkes>Agreed with the ET for Chambers being the
preferred directory.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/984-1
03:13:44.446 --> 03:13:47.925
<v Josh Sparkes>Legal 500 not being the preferred
directory,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/984-2
03:13:47.925 --> 03:13:51.944
<v Josh Sparkes>but still an area of interest or for
other regions.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/984-3
03:13:51.944 --> 03:13:57.897
<v Josh Sparkes>So this is very region specific with the
view of it being a global approach.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/985-0
03:13:58.777 --> 03:14:03.299
<v Josh Sparkes>With the lead of the direction being
chambers,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/985-1
03:14:03.299 --> 03:14:10.997
<v Josh Sparkes>the policy dictates that anything for
Band 3 and above band 3211 being the best</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/985-2
03:14:10.997 --> 03:14:15.038
<v Josh Sparkes>ranking,
is deemed an an policy supported</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/985-3
03:14:15.038 --> 03:14:16.097
<v Josh Sparkes>submission.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/986-0
03:14:16.777 --> 03:14:20.861
<v Josh Sparkes>And anything below that is deemed as it
would require an exception,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/986-1
03:14:20.861 --> 03:14:25.786
<v Josh Sparkes>and there's lots of different routes then
at that stage that you can take without</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/986-2
03:14:25.786 --> 03:14:28.970
<v Josh Sparkes>going into detail right now.
And then for legal 500,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/986-3
03:14:28.970 --> 03:14:32.754
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not deemed supported to which would
then be an exception.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/986-4
03:14:32.754 --> 03:14:35.217
<v Josh Sparkes>And then also takes that route. It's the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/987-0
03:14:36.457 --> 03:14:41.343
<v Josh Sparkes>Subjective with the partners and the
legal team is because it's something that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/987-1
03:14:41.343 --> 03:14:44.622
<v Josh Sparkes>they're how they're seeing externally in
the market,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/987-2
03:14:44.622 --> 03:14:49.447
<v Josh Sparkes>that it takes a considerable amount of
time and effort from legal team BD and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/987-3
03:14:49.447 --> 03:14:53.777
<v Josh Sparkes>from ask client perspective and also
operations it's external facing.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/988-0
03:14:54.257 --> 03:15:00.130
<v Josh Sparkes>Reputational all of those things,
and you said probably the previous past</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/988-1
03:15:00.130 --> 03:15:04.574
<v Josh Sparkes>that we talked about was a global end to
end. You know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/988-2
03:15:04.574 --> 03:15:09.337
<v Josh Sparkes>each of you within client this this is
regional and it has.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/989-0
03:15:10.057 --> 03:15:13.815
<v Josh Sparkes>Legal and compliance and regulatory
overlay for these? Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/989-1
03:15:13.815 --> 03:15:18.312
<v Josh Sparkes>But we're dealing with matters.
So what goes into the submissions is the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/989-2
03:15:18.312 --> 03:15:22.933
<v Josh Sparkes>what the teams legal teams have been
working on right then at their matter</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/989-3
03:15:22.933 --> 03:15:26.875
<v Josh Sparkes>level that matter level. OK.
So we're fully master information.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/989-4
03:15:26.875 --> 03:15:29.217
<v Josh Sparkes>So that could be confidential matters.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/990-0
03:15:29.377 --> 03:15:35.617
<v Josh Sparkes>As a confidential section and the
submission process that they have to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/990-1
03:15:35.617 --> 03:15:42.385
<v Josh Sparkes>identify those and redacting information
as necessary and published at these</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/990-2
03:15:42.385 --> 03:15:48.977
<v Josh Sparkes>changes and the legal 500 level and what
does Australia have is they have.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/991-0
03:15:49.017 --> 03:15:53.241
<v Josh Sparkes>The as their equivalent as well.
They have chambers and these are 500,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/991-1
03:15:53.241 --> 03:15:56.870
<v Josh Sparkes>so that is the view.
The only difference I would say then is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/991-2
03:15:56.870 --> 03:15:59.785
<v Josh Sparkes>Europe tend to switch their preferred
directory.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/991-3
03:15:59.785 --> 03:16:04.485
<v Josh Sparkes>So Europe go for legal 500 over chambers
to which Europe also do bands for and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/991-4
03:16:04.485 --> 03:16:05.497
<v Josh Sparkes>above the scheme.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/992-0
03:16:06.137 --> 03:16:09.950
<v Josh Sparkes>And agreed submission supported versus
anything below that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/992-1
03:16:09.950 --> 03:16:14.208
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't actually understand bands is that
it's how they're ranked.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/992-2
03:16:14.208 --> 03:16:19.228
<v Josh Sparkes>So how a lawyer or how a practise area is
ranked the practise and the partners</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/992-3
03:16:19.228 --> 03:16:22.533
<v Josh Sparkes>ranked, yeah,
so there's practise level ranking and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/992-4
03:16:22.533 --> 03:16:25.457
<v Josh Sparkes>there's also individual lawyer level
ranking.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/993-0
03:16:25.897 --> 03:16:26.257
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/994-0
03:16:28.017 --> 03:16:31.498
<v Josh Sparkes>Hierarchy within the hierarchy within the
hierarchy.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/994-1
03:16:31.498 --> 03:16:36.359
<v Josh Sparkes>It was a lot of fire evils and this
process. OK, so maybe when he starts,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/994-2
03:16:36.359 --> 03:16:39.644
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean that was a good and my mind to
opera mosa.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/994-3
03:16:39.644 --> 03:16:44.177
<v Josh Sparkes>How do they come into then as a request.
So this one starts with us.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/995-0
03:16:44.537 --> 03:16:49.113
<v Josh Sparkes>So this is the project that effectively
is an ongoing project that runs</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/995-1
03:16:49.113 --> 03:16:52.037
<v Josh Sparkes>throughout the year on the back of
reporting,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/995-2
03:16:52.037 --> 03:16:57.185
<v Josh Sparkes>was it that was it triggered at the back
of something else or is it something it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/995-3
03:16:57.185 --> 03:17:02.524
<v Josh Sparkes>literally starts its life with us with us
because we get a notification of when the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/995-4
03:17:02.524 --> 03:17:03.097
<v Josh Sparkes>jet went.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/996-0
03:17:06.097 --> 03:17:10.505
<v Josh Sparkes>So for this directory you get the
deadline that it needs to be populated at</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/996-1
03:17:10.505 --> 03:17:13.406
<v Josh Sparkes>a certain date with the certain
information, yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/996-2
03:17:13.406 --> 03:17:16.944
<v Josh Sparkes>So here's all the categories.
Here's the deadline basically,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/996-3
03:17:16.944 --> 03:17:18.337
<v Josh Sparkes>and I reach out to your.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/997-0
03:17:18.937 --> 03:17:25.563
<v Josh Sparkes>CMG teams to then arrange for submissions
and what supports required and who,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/997-1
03:17:25.563 --> 03:17:29.810
<v Josh Sparkes>so who?
How do you get that first notification of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/997-2
03:17:29.810 --> 03:17:34.993
<v Josh Sparkes>when you need to do it?
External e-mail from the provider of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/997-3
03:17:34.993 --> 03:17:36.777
<v Josh Sparkes>generally just be up.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/998-0
03:17:37.377 --> 03:17:42.176
<v Josh Sparkes>It goes out to all of the all of the law
firms that, yes,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/998-1
03:17:42.176 --> 03:17:47.886
<v Josh Sparkes>I would say it's a newsletter,
but it's a notification of here's the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/998-2
03:17:47.886 --> 03:17:54.010
<v Josh Sparkes>upcoming deadlines and it can also be
sourced on the website because some</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/998-3
03:17:54.010 --> 03:17:55.417
<v Josh Sparkes>things legal 500.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/999-0
03:17:56.937 --> 03:18:00.742
<v Josh Sparkes>500 I'm not saying, I mean,
maybe it's legal500.com.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/999-1
03:18:00.742 --> 03:18:04.117
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you get to see that notifications on
there?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/999-2
03:18:04.117 --> 03:18:08.784
<v Josh Sparkes>Do they announce it on their homepage?
So I think I think, yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/999-3
03:18:08.784 --> 03:18:11.657
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's worth to like mention that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1000-0
03:18:12.737 --> 03:18:18.812
<v Josh Sparkes>For both Chambers and Eagle 5 hundreds,
they are two main directories,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1000-1
03:18:18.812 --> 03:18:22.577
<v Josh Sparkes>service provider and they each of them
has.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1001-0
03:18:24.057 --> 03:18:28.343
<v Josh Sparkes>A number of different guides that we can
we can submit to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1001-1
03:18:28.343 --> 03:18:34.156
<v Josh Sparkes>So basically it's a year round process
because the UK they have the for example</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1001-2
03:18:34.156 --> 03:18:39.969
<v Josh Sparkes>the UK Guide, Global Guide, APEC Guide,
Europe Guide or France Guide or Germany</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1001-3
03:18:39.969 --> 03:18:43.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Guide.
They have different submission deadline.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1002-0
03:18:43.977 --> 03:18:48.268
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah, so within that, yeah,
there's additional submission deadlines.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1002-1
03:18:48.268 --> 03:18:51.189
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So they have different submissions then I.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1002-2
03:18:51.189 --> 03:18:56.077
<v Josh Sparkes>So basically it is all through the years
and every point of the at every point in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1002-3
03:18:56.077 --> 03:18:59.177
<v Josh Sparkes>the year,
there's a guide or there's a submissions.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1003-0
03:18:59.737 --> 03:19:06.410
<v Josh Sparkes>It's opening for a second submissions and
so it's not the same every year. No, no,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1003-1
03:19:06.410 --> 03:19:13.003
<v Josh Sparkes>that would be roughly up to around 10 and
the guide can change per year per month</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1003-2
03:19:13.003 --> 03:19:15.737
<v Josh Sparkes>change. Yeah, even for us I think.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1004-0
03:19:16.497 --> 03:19:19.398
<v Josh Sparkes>For it was for from last year's the
chambers.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1004-1
03:19:19.398 --> 03:19:24.633
<v Josh Sparkes>They they launched the Germany and France
guide before that it all incorporated in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1004-2
03:19:24.633 --> 03:19:28.669
<v Josh Sparkes>the in the global guide. Yeah.
But then they separate these two</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1004-3
03:19:28.669 --> 03:19:31.697
<v Josh Sparkes>countries into a separate guide.
So there's in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1005-0
03:19:32.257 --> 03:19:35.011
<v Josh Sparkes>More workforce. OK,
so you get this external,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1005-1
03:19:35.011 --> 03:19:39.622
<v Josh Sparkes>so today you get an external e-mail
literally. Do you get a physical e-mail?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1005-2
03:19:39.622 --> 03:19:42.496
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So via e-mail or in legal 5 hundreds case</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1005-3
03:19:42.496 --> 03:19:45.669
<v Josh Sparkes>that it's sometimes you need to go
searching for it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1005-4
03:19:45.669 --> 03:19:50.220
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not always readily available. OK.
So it's going to be proactive. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1005-5
03:19:50.220 --> 03:19:51.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Roughly when that is due to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1006-0
03:19:52.937 --> 03:19:57.570
<v Josh Sparkes>Is round about that time that you have to
go and search their website and you've</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1006-1
03:19:57.570 --> 03:20:01.518
<v Josh Sparkes>got an idea of when? Yeah, you know,
it's sort of around this month.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1006-2
03:20:01.518 --> 03:20:05.293
<v Josh Sparkes>So does it tend to coincide also with
chambers? No, you couldn't.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1006-3
03:20:05.293 --> 03:20:08.097
<v Josh Sparkes>So you don't even get,
you can't even make some.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1007-0
03:20:09.177 --> 03:20:13.300
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Mark, maybe Mark,
maybe you can remind me that if we're</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1007-1
03:20:13.300 --> 03:20:18.935
<v Josh Sparkes>able to pick up the same external e-mail,
it can come into service now as a task.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1007-2
03:20:18.935 --> 03:20:23.402
<v Josh Sparkes>I know we discussed that.
Was that something you should park and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1007-3
03:20:23.402 --> 03:20:24.777
<v Josh Sparkes>look at it comes in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1008-0
03:20:25.257 --> 03:20:29.977
<v Josh Sparkes>As the trigger, so it's form at legal500.
com.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1009-0
03:20:30.577 --> 03:20:34.958
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, if we if we know what that is,
then we can certainly get a trigger to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1009-1
03:20:34.958 --> 03:20:36.457
<v Mark Sedge>trigger the task for sure.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1010-0
03:20:35.257 --> 03:20:38.860
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So what I'm saying, yeah,
it it then goes into ServiceNow.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1010-1
03:20:38.860 --> 03:20:43.295
<v Josh Sparkes>It will pick it up and then create the
task for you so you get notified through</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1010-2
03:20:43.295 --> 03:20:47.897
<v Josh Sparkes>your dashboard of those types of things
because we know that it's always at legal.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1011-0
03:20:46.297 --> 03:20:49.824
<v Mark Sedge>Does it is it? Does it exist today?
Does it exist today?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1011-1
03:20:49.824 --> 03:20:52.857
<v Mark Sedge>I'm pulling into Cherwell or you do it
manually.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1013-0
03:20:53.297 --> 03:20:56.606
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, we just got the e-mail in to share.
We'll start the work from there.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1017-0
03:20:56.217 --> 03:20:58.705
<v Mark Sedge>So we'll pick it up. We've got a list.
Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1013-1
03:20:56.606 --> 03:20:57.577
<v Josh Sparkes>That that's the start.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1017-1
03:20:58.705 --> 03:21:01.249
<v Mark Sedge>we'll pick it up because we've got a list
of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1017-2
03:21:01.249 --> 03:21:05.673
<v Mark Sedge>So I think there's something like 32
mailboxes that come in and create records.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1014-0
03:21:02.137 --> 03:21:02.257
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1015-0
03:21:04.017 --> 03:21:04.257
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1017-3
03:21:05.673 --> 03:21:10.097
<v Mark Sedge>So we will catch it naturally and then be
able to work out the treatment of it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1016-0
03:21:08.217 --> 03:21:08.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1018-0
03:21:11.257 --> 03:21:14.879
<v Josh Sparkes>But it does it always come from the same
e-mail address mailbox.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1018-1
03:21:14.879 --> 03:21:18.892
<v Josh Sparkes>I would say domain. Is it saying that?
Yeah, but it could be a problem.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1018-2
03:21:18.892 --> 03:21:23.294
<v Josh Sparkes>What I'm thinking like Mark from legal
500 or from like the person may change.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1018-3
03:21:23.294 --> 03:21:26.137
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, the domain.
I think that what you're saying.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1023-0
03:21:25.657 --> 03:21:28.558
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.
So we can do it from from the we can do</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1019-0
03:21:27.417 --> 03:21:27.737
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1023-1
03:21:28.558 --> 03:21:32.217
<v Mark Sedge>it from the domain.
So you can pick it up from the domain</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1020-0
03:21:30.977 --> 03:21:32.857
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1023-2
03:21:32.217 --> 03:21:35.244
<v Mark Sedge>address.
But the other the other thing we could</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1023-3
03:21:35.244 --> 03:21:39.407
<v Mark Sedge>also do potentially is if if it's if it's
always titled the same,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1021-0
03:21:35.497 --> 03:21:35.617
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1023-4
03:21:39.407 --> 03:21:44.075
<v Mark Sedge>we can we can put some heightened
analysis on what comes in and then pick</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1022-0
03:21:43.657 --> 03:21:43.777
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1023-5
03:21:44.075 --> 03:21:45.337
<v Mark Sedge>it up and also lift.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1024-0
03:21:45.417 --> 03:21:50.457
<v Mark Sedge>Without certain content and drop it into
the record to give you, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1024-1
03:21:50.457 --> 03:21:53.617
<v Mark Sedge>a sort of better,
you know request that lands.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1026-0
03:21:51.977 --> 03:21:56.357
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it? Yeah. Does it always?
Does it always say directory in the title?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1026-1
03:21:56.357 --> 03:21:59.033
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
that's probably what you're saying,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1026-2
03:21:59.033 --> 03:22:02.258
<v Josh Sparkes>Mark is keywords from then. Yeah.
And I think, yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1025-0
03:22:01.937 --> 03:22:03.017
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1026-3
03:22:02.258 --> 03:22:07.003
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just trying to think of the other
emails we get from them because what we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1026-4
03:22:07.003 --> 03:22:10.897
<v Josh Sparkes>don't want to miss is all the other ones,
right. So we have to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1028-0
03:22:10.977 --> 03:22:15.846
<v Josh Sparkes>To sign up to the newsletters in order to
get notification that the webinar is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1028-1
03:22:15.846 --> 03:22:20.346
<v Josh Sparkes>launching for the global guide,
do we need to attend that ahead of again</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1027-0
03:22:17.537 --> 03:22:17.897
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1028-2
03:22:20.346 --> 03:22:25.216
<v Josh Sparkes>launch? Things like that where yeah,
as long as all legal 500 and all chambers</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1028-3
03:22:25.216 --> 03:22:28.977
<v Josh Sparkes>emails our mailbox,
there's generally either an action or a.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1033-0
03:22:28.417 --> 03:22:33.025
<v Mark Sedge>Yes. What I'm thinking, sorry. What? I'm.
Yeah. Sorry. What I'm thinking is yes,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1029-0
03:22:29.657 --> 03:22:31.257
<v Josh Sparkes>FYI, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1033-1
03:22:33.025 --> 03:22:37.121
<v Mark Sedge>we'd catch all of the ones coming in,
but it enables you to be smarter.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1030-0
03:22:34.337 --> 03:22:34.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1033-2
03:22:37.121 --> 03:22:40.649
<v Mark Sedge>So if if we can pick up a typical string
of text or keywords,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1031-0
03:22:38.297 --> 03:22:38.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1033-3
03:22:40.649 --> 03:22:44.177
<v Mark Sedge>it means that we might be able to root it.
Say, you've got a.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1032-0
03:22:41.057 --> 03:22:41.177
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1036-0
03:22:44.737 --> 03:22:48.694
<v Mark Sedge>A particular request type related to the
directories if it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1036-1
03:22:48.694 --> 03:22:53.576
<v Mark Sedge>If it looks at the string and picks up
text which references directories,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1034-0
03:22:49.617 --> 03:22:49.737
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1036-2
03:22:53.576 --> 03:22:58.919
<v Mark Sedge>then it will drop it into that sort of
request structure as a kickoff, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1035-0
03:22:55.137 --> 03:22:55.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1036-3
03:22:58.919 --> 03:22:59.777
<v Mark Sedge>so it's just.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1038-0
03:22:59.217 --> 03:23:03.682
<v Josh Sparkes>This is really similar to remark.
This is really similar to the challenge</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1038-1
03:23:03.682 --> 03:23:07.001
<v Josh Sparkes>that we have in the villain with Portal
notifications,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1037-0
03:23:06.137 --> 03:23:06.417
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1038-2
03:23:07.001 --> 03:23:11.707
<v Josh Sparkes>so it's probably worth agreeing what that
solution looks like and we apply it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1038-3
03:23:11.707 --> 03:23:16.595
<v Josh Sparkes>across both teams so they get a lot of
portal notifications that come in that we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1038-4
03:23:16.595 --> 03:23:16.897
<v Josh Sparkes>just.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1039-0
03:23:16.977 --> 03:23:20.356
<v Josh Sparkes>Do not need to take action,
but there are some that they need to take</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1039-1
03:23:20.356 --> 03:23:23.155
<v Josh Sparkes>action and we need to figure out rules on
how we do that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1039-2
03:23:23.155 --> 03:23:27.017
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll get an exercise that we'll need
to run through trying to get for those</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1039-3
03:23:27.017 --> 03:23:29.962
<v Josh Sparkes>that with no action,
at least you're they're capturing them,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1039-4
03:23:29.962 --> 03:23:33.196
<v Josh Sparkes>that they're FYI seminars,
but some of them actually might take up</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1039-5
03:23:33.196 --> 03:23:36.817
<v Josh Sparkes>some of your that you could have that
actually start an end date. Who's a.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1041-0
03:23:36.937 --> 03:23:40.900
<v Josh Sparkes>Attending so that in your metrics of
looking at all the capacity of what</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1041-1
03:23:40.900 --> 03:23:44.212
<v Josh Sparkes>you're doing at the end,
you can say I actually attended pre</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1041-2
03:23:44.212 --> 03:23:47.252
<v Josh Sparkes>seminars, you know,
so it it adds up all the tasks that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1041-3
03:23:47.252 --> 03:23:49.913
<v Josh Sparkes>you're doing,
even if they were seminar related.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1041-4
03:23:49.913 --> 03:23:54.310
<v Josh Sparkes>But for these ones you can capture the
fact that you know take that offline that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1041-5
03:23:54.310 --> 03:23:56.537
<v Josh Sparkes>it is a directory activity that you need.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1042-0
03:23:56.657 --> 03:24:02.358
<v Josh Sparkes>To do I think at that level is the domain
basically tells you that it is in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1042-1
03:24:02.358 --> 03:24:08.210
<v Josh Sparkes>relation to and I think that's that's
where we leave it there as a it goes in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1042-2
03:24:08.210 --> 03:24:13.537
<v Josh Sparkes>that direction because I think where that
then falls into the process.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1043-0
03:24:14.617 --> 03:24:19.365
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not going to be able to pull that
from the e-mail to align it to the sub</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1043-1
03:24:19.365 --> 03:24:22.470
<v Josh Sparkes>category.
I think the high level categorisation is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1043-2
03:24:22.470 --> 03:24:26.732
<v Josh Sparkes>that, yes, like 500 chambers.
The directory likes to directories here</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1043-3
03:24:26.732 --> 03:24:30.324
<v Josh Sparkes>and that comes in.
So you just talk back to the assignment</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1043-4
03:24:30.324 --> 03:24:32.577
<v Josh Sparkes>group we talked about so it comes in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1044-0
03:24:33.417 --> 03:24:37.632
<v Josh Sparkes>Client to client.
At this point you don't need client UK</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1044-1
03:24:37.632 --> 03:24:41.257
<v Josh Sparkes>client Australia.
We do deal with them mutually,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1044-2
03:24:41.257 --> 03:24:46.656
<v Josh Sparkes>but let as in Brisbane will deal with
AIPAC. UK will deal with EMEA. US.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1044-3
03:24:46.656 --> 03:24:50.206
<v Josh Sparkes>What's it? I'm asking him.
What was the UK one?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1044-4
03:24:50.206 --> 03:24:53.017
<v Josh Sparkes>You said that so quickly? I mean 2001.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1045-0
03:24:54.657 --> 03:24:59.970
<v Josh Sparkes>MEA means Euro, Middle East and Oh no,
that's what you said. Yeah. Yeah, yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1045-1
03:24:59.970 --> 03:25:05.150
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah. OK. And UK and Australia. Yeah. OK.
And that's split. OK, that's fine.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1045-2
03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:09.657
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's split between, like,
Glasgow Brisbane. Yeah. So they're.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1046-0
03:25:10.457 --> 03:25:15.659
<v Josh Sparkes>Although there's visibility across,
they're generally dealt with locally,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1046-1
03:25:15.659 --> 03:25:18.893
<v Josh Sparkes>so when chambers and legal 500,
you're still,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1046-2
03:25:18.893 --> 03:25:23.604
<v Josh Sparkes>they're still doing their individual
legal paralegals in the area,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1046-3
03:25:23.604 --> 03:25:28.737
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's it gets it is a global directory,
is that right? Each of those?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1047-0
03:25:29.977 --> 03:25:34.995
<v Josh Sparkes>There isn't one directory, yes,
and then it has the regional ones as well.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1047-1
03:25:34.995 --> 03:25:39.411
<v Josh Sparkes>They have their regional deadlines for
each of their directories,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1047-2
03:25:39.411 --> 03:25:43.358
<v Josh Sparkes>so it could be small,
but if in that e-mail that comes in,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1047-3
03:25:43.358 --> 03:25:47.641
<v Josh Sparkes>if it says directory,
you know you're getting that notification</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1047-4
03:25:47.641 --> 03:25:48.377
<v Josh Sparkes>for France.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1048-0
03:25:48.497 --> 03:25:53.057
<v Josh Sparkes>In Germany, a particular time, you know,
the assignment group is UK based or it is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1048-1
03:25:53.057 --> 03:25:57.617
<v Josh Sparkes>for a directory for someone else it could.
It could also route or it could be that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1048-2
03:25:57.617 --> 03:26:01.628
<v Josh Sparkes>you just land them and they get also
assigned to whoever's working on it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1048-3
03:26:01.628 --> 03:26:02.617
<v Josh Sparkes>within your group.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1049-0
03:26:04.417 --> 03:26:07.845
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I don't think. I mean,
how's it coming today?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1049-1
03:26:07.845 --> 03:26:13.382
<v Josh Sparkes>So show you get that e-mail and then you
assign it. So there is the respective DNA.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1049-2
03:26:13.382 --> 03:26:18.129
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, certainly have that matrix.
I'm not maybe something you want to do</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1049-3
03:26:18.129 --> 03:26:23.337
<v Josh Sparkes>phase one but that could be in place that
if it is for Europe based on the UK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1050-0
03:26:23.417 --> 03:26:26.639
<v Josh Sparkes>To deal with it,
and if it's for others Australian based</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1050-1
03:26:26.639 --> 03:26:29.409
<v Josh Sparkes>in the Australian team, get assigned them.
Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1050-2
03:26:29.409 --> 03:26:31.897
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that as we are working on it,
yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1050-3
03:26:31.897 --> 03:26:35.910
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we also need to be careful that
if it is global that everyone,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1050-4
03:26:35.910 --> 03:26:40.377
<v Josh Sparkes>the person that's taking the action is
then that's distributed globally, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1051-0
03:26:41.377 --> 03:26:44.662
<v Josh Sparkes>So where we would then make it region
specific, if it's global,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1051-1
03:26:44.662 --> 03:26:48.513
<v Josh Sparkes>that needs to be communicated across the
field, you still get transparent.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1051-2
03:26:48.513 --> 03:26:51.747
<v Josh Sparkes>So just because it's assigned to it,
it's not like, Oh my God,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1051-3
03:26:51.747 --> 03:26:55.751
<v Josh Sparkes>I can't see anything else in the you get
on that dashboard because you're a a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1051-4
03:26:55.751 --> 03:26:58.010
<v Josh Sparkes>client group,
you'll get to see everything.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1051-5
03:26:58.010 --> 03:27:00.937
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just all to assignment of who's
working on what so.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1052-0
03:27:01.137 --> 03:27:05.557
<v Josh Sparkes>You would see Australia, Australia,
we would see you and everyone gets to see</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1052-1
03:27:05.557 --> 03:27:08.505
<v Josh Sparkes>everything.
So what I would say is with directories</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1052-2
03:27:08.505 --> 03:27:12.926
<v Josh Sparkes>is effectively you've got like a project
manager, so your directory's expert.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1052-3
03:27:12.926 --> 03:27:17.460
<v Josh Sparkes>So your directory's subject matter expert
who would then within client no PM is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1052-4
03:27:17.460 --> 03:27:17.857
<v Josh Sparkes>within.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1053-0
03:27:18.657 --> 03:27:22.338
<v Josh Sparkes>Your team,
your project matter experts on that would</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1053-1
03:27:22.338 --> 03:27:27.617
<v Josh Sparkes>effectively be like your project manager,
your coordinator of the directory</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1053-2
03:27:27.617 --> 03:27:32.897
<v Josh Sparkes>submission process that would then
basically coordinate out the work to the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1053-3
03:27:32.897 --> 03:27:34.217
<v Josh Sparkes>team internally of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1054-0
03:27:34.737 --> 03:27:37.776
<v Josh Sparkes>Drafting submissions for in clients. Yeah,
OK,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1054-1
03:27:37.776 --> 03:27:41.202
<v Josh Sparkes>so you've got a skills matrix there for
directories.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1054-2
03:27:41.202 --> 03:27:46.117
<v Josh Sparkes>Presumably that you have the PM and then
levels of who you're working with,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1054-3
03:27:46.117 --> 03:27:50.643
<v Josh Sparkes>so that Kelly's our coordinator,
who is our expert in directories who</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1054-4
03:27:50.643 --> 03:27:52.777
<v Josh Sparkes>would then largely take a lot of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1055-0
03:27:53.097 --> 03:27:58.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Those like newsletter information coming
from the directory provider and then from</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1055-1
03:27:58.420 --> 03:28:03.294
<v Josh Sparkes>there make the decision of who needs to
work on what activities in order to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1055-2
03:28:03.294 --> 03:28:06.244
<v Josh Sparkes>deliver.
So if we've got what 400 submissions</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1055-3
03:28:06.244 --> 03:28:09.515
<v Josh Sparkes>globally,
then how is that going to be distributed</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1055-4
03:28:09.515 --> 03:28:12.017
<v Josh Sparkes>out across the team? And she does that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1056-0
03:28:12.617 --> 03:28:15.884
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that her role as PM?
Is that how she does that at the moment?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1056-1
03:28:15.884 --> 03:28:18.197
<v Josh Sparkes>So she'll. Yeah,
that's what she does as the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1056-2
03:28:18.197 --> 03:28:20.962
<v Josh Sparkes>But the system could do that based on
rules, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1056-3
03:28:20.962 --> 03:28:23.777
<v Josh Sparkes>or it could be that they all land with
her to sign out.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1056-4
03:28:23.777 --> 03:28:28.000
<v Josh Sparkes>But you could use the system to do rules.
So you would get presumably at the moment</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1056-5
03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:30.363
<v Josh Sparkes>you.
So it comes in to show whether it will be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1056-6
03:28:30.363 --> 03:28:31.017
<v Josh Sparkes>directly for.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1057-0
03:28:32.017 --> 03:28:34.810
<v Josh Sparkes>Let's take the global one.
That's probably actually because that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1057-1
03:28:34.810 --> 03:28:37.389
<v Josh Sparkes>probably requires a lot more coordination.
Is that correct?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1057-2
03:28:37.389 --> 03:28:38.937
<v Josh Sparkes>Am I making that assumption correct?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1058-0
03:28:41.377 --> 03:28:45.715
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, OK, OK. So it comes in.
Let's just say that equal is complex.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1058-1
03:28:45.715 --> 03:28:51.171
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got a notification that this needs
to be populated at a certain end date or</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1058-2
03:28:51.171 --> 03:28:55.247
<v Josh Sparkes>submission Dateline.
And what information do you get upfront?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1058-3
03:28:55.247 --> 03:28:59.257
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you just get this is required or is
there a checklist so?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1059-0
03:28:59.697 --> 03:29:03.508
<v Josh Sparkes>Chambers has we have a category selection
of here's the deadline.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1059-1
03:29:03.508 --> 03:29:08.128
<v Josh Sparkes>Here's the categories we then need to
decide what we're actually submitting to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1059-2
03:29:08.128 --> 03:29:11.419
<v Josh Sparkes>So generally speaking is what we
submitted to last year,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1059-3
03:29:11.419 --> 03:29:14.018
<v Josh Sparkes>but that's when the policy comes into
place.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1059-4
03:29:14.018 --> 03:29:16.617
<v Josh Sparkes>So that there needs to be a decision
around.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1060-0
03:29:16.857 --> 03:29:21.671
<v Josh Sparkes>With the director group of what are we
actually going to support and what's the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1060-1
03:29:21.671 --> 03:29:26.486
<v Josh Sparkes>categories like what, what are they,
what type of things are in the categories?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1060-2
03:29:26.486 --> 03:29:30.940
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, I'm asking both simple questions,
but what does that support like</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1060-3
03:29:30.940 --> 03:29:34.431
<v Josh Sparkes>technology, AI education.
And it could be loan corporate.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1060-4
03:29:34.431 --> 03:29:36.297
<v Josh Sparkes>You know it's industry finance.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1061-0
03:29:37.297 --> 03:29:39.709
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
it's broken down into a lot of categories,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1061-1
03:29:39.709 --> 03:29:39.857
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1062-0
03:29:41.577 --> 03:29:47.433
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you get like why should you go to
ashes versus another legal fan and it ran.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1062-1
03:29:47.433 --> 03:29:52.997
<v Josh Sparkes>Right. OK. Specialisms. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Effectively it's systemised that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1062-2
03:29:52.997 --> 03:29:57.537
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you get the request you can select
the OR they're told.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1063-0
03:29:58.137 --> 03:30:01.313
<v Josh Sparkes>Which categories needs to be populated?
Is that right? That's the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1063-1
03:30:01.313 --> 03:30:04.585
<v Josh Sparkes>That's how the requests come in.
So it could be that we're doing the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1063-2
03:30:04.585 --> 03:30:05.297
<v Josh Sparkes>categories for.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1064-0
03:30:07.297 --> 03:30:11.720
<v Josh Sparkes>12345 yeah.
So we have on the form when they selected</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1064-1
03:30:11.720 --> 03:30:15.407
<v Josh Sparkes>entries,
they're able to select fleeting 500</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1064-2
03:30:15.407 --> 03:30:19.994
<v Josh Sparkes>chambers and then input the category and
practise that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1064-3
03:30:19.994 --> 03:30:25.401
<v Josh Sparkes>They aren't when you say so,
the CNG input into us to request the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1064-4
03:30:25.401 --> 03:30:26.057
<v Josh Sparkes>support.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1065-0
03:30:26.857 --> 03:30:30.607
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. OK. So you get the initial,
it's going to happen, yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1065-1
03:30:30.607 --> 03:30:34.297
<v Josh Sparkes>at this deadline.
And then do you then communicate with CNG?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1065-2
03:30:34.297 --> 03:30:37.018
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
this is what I'm trying to think of that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1065-3
03:30:37.018 --> 03:30:41.192
<v Josh Sparkes>actually is where we get the,
that's where the policy part comes in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1065-4
03:30:41.192 --> 03:30:44.761
<v Josh Sparkes>And we have, you know,
that historical review of what's in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1065-5
03:30:44.761 --> 03:30:46.697
<v Josh Sparkes>policy and what's not in policy.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1066-0
03:30:46.737 --> 03:30:49.466
<v Josh Sparkes>Say,
what would we suggest as being something</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1066-1
03:30:49.466 --> 03:30:53.798
<v Josh Sparkes>that we we should support based on
previous rankings over the last three</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1066-2
03:30:53.798 --> 03:30:56.113
<v Josh Sparkes>years?
Put that to the leadership team</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1066-3
03:30:56.113 --> 03:31:00.207
<v Josh Sparkes>leadership team, then review.
Decide that with head of Region report</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1066-4
03:31:00.207 --> 03:31:05.192
<v Josh Sparkes>back in on what needs to go forward as an
exception with the support of CMG and ask</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1066-5
03:31:05.192 --> 03:31:06.617
<v Josh Sparkes>line if that's not then.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1067-0
03:31:06.697 --> 03:31:09.693
<v Josh Sparkes>Agreed upon,
that needs to go to the legal teams and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1067-1
03:31:09.693 --> 03:31:14.102
<v Josh Sparkes>they need to resource that within their
legal team with their PES associates,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1067-2
03:31:14.102 --> 03:31:16.929
<v Josh Sparkes>trainees.
Whoever wants to work on the submission</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1067-3
03:31:16.929 --> 03:31:21.451
<v Josh Sparkes>because it's not even something that's on
policy that aspiring CMG will support</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1067-4
03:31:21.451 --> 03:31:24.617
<v Josh Sparkes>that has been,
can I go back and I just because I think</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1067-5
03:31:24.617 --> 03:31:26.257
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm I'm thinking I'm getting.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1068-0
03:31:26.617 --> 03:31:31.220
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes. So it comes in to you,
you know it's happening. You then contact,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1068-1
03:31:31.220 --> 03:31:34.656
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a.
So it's that you're going to assign it to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1068-2
03:31:34.656 --> 03:31:38.546
<v Josh Sparkes>members of your team, right?
Not just not yet. Not yes yet.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1068-3
03:31:38.546 --> 03:31:42.177
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's just OK.
So it's that with PM or one person and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1068-4
03:31:42.177 --> 03:31:46.457
<v Josh Sparkes>then they have Ian's, me and Kayla.
That's OK. If you want to do.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1069-0
03:31:46.497 --> 03:31:52.826
<v Josh Sparkes>We contact another group, CMG, correct?
So basically we communicate the like,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1069-1
03:31:52.826 --> 03:31:57.127
<v Josh Sparkes>look, this is the for example,
this is the UK guide.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1069-2
03:31:57.127 --> 03:32:02.484
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not accepting submissions.
The submission deadline is and we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1069-3
03:32:02.484 --> 03:32:06.217
<v Josh Sparkes>communicate this information to CMG and
then.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1070-0
03:32:06.577 --> 03:32:11.683
<v Josh Sparkes>Because the the direct the directory
providers like they might have hundreds</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1070-1
03:32:11.683 --> 03:32:16.326
<v Josh Sparkes>of practise area accepting submissions,
but we are not submitting to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1070-2
03:32:16.326 --> 03:32:20.703
<v Josh Sparkes>OK so we are just CMG. Yeah.
And also we will provide information</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1070-3
03:32:20.703 --> 03:32:24.417
<v Josh Sparkes>because we want to focus on the practise
areas that we.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1071-0
03:32:24.857 --> 03:32:30.296
<v Josh Sparkes>Like rank rank in the rank best.
So we want to keep that ranking so we</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1071-1
03:32:30.296 --> 03:32:36.272
<v Josh Sparkes>will focus on the all the credits area
that been ranked grand three or about.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1071-2
03:32:36.272 --> 03:32:39.337
<v Josh Sparkes>So they have a better chance of getting.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1072-0
03:32:40.657 --> 03:32:44.153
<v Josh Sparkes>Battle breaking,
or at least keep at that level. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1072-1
03:32:44.153 --> 03:32:49.176
<v Josh Sparkes>so so it's the CMG. You then contact them.
This is the guys, this is the yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1072-2
03:32:49.176 --> 03:32:52.355
<v Josh Sparkes>this is your past record.
So so you include some.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1072-3
03:32:52.355 --> 03:32:56.297
<v Josh Sparkes>There's probably that bit that I'm trying
to get to what the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1073-0
03:32:56.857 --> 03:32:59.488
<v Josh Sparkes>Communicate. What's the CMG? Yes.
At that point,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1073-1
03:32:59.488 --> 03:33:03.194
<v Josh Sparkes>you're saying this is the ones that are.
So there's two routes here.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1073-2
03:33:03.194 --> 03:33:07.222
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got ones that are approved,
submissions that we can all support on.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1073-3
03:33:07.222 --> 03:33:11.357
<v Josh Sparkes>So from a CMG perspective and from an ask
client perspective to which we are</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1073-4
03:33:11.357 --> 03:33:15.009
<v Josh Sparkes>reaching out to CMG to say,
here's all your submissions that we can</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1073-5
03:33:15.009 --> 03:33:16.137
<v Josh Sparkes>that are categorised.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1074-0
03:33:16.377 --> 03:33:19.697
<v Josh Sparkes>And above this is how we can work with
you. Here's the deadline.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1074-1
03:33:19.697 --> 03:33:23.273
<v Josh Sparkes>Here's the support required.
Here's the length of the form of you go.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1074-2
03:33:23.273 --> 03:33:27.360
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, they're fine for those that are not.
And we will not reach out and will not</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1074-3
03:33:27.360 --> 03:33:31.141
<v Josh Sparkes>engage at that point because we don't
know if we have to support on them.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1074-4
03:33:31.141 --> 03:33:35.228
<v Josh Sparkes>And CMG don't know if they've to support
them on them at this stage because all</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1074-5
03:33:35.228 --> 03:33:36.097
<v Josh Sparkes>we've been given.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1075-0
03:33:36.137 --> 03:33:40.131
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a category in the deadline,
but actually it falls out with policy,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1075-1
03:33:40.131 --> 03:33:44.179
<v Josh Sparkes>so the direction hasn't been confirmed as
to who can actually support those</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1075-2
03:33:44.179 --> 03:33:46.895
<v Josh Sparkes>submissions.
The ones that you can process are the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1075-3
03:33:46.895 --> 03:33:49.292
<v Josh Sparkes>ones with CMG, you can send it to them,
yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1075-4
03:33:49.292 --> 03:33:53.233
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's what Mandy's talking about is
that e-mail communication to say,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1075-5
03:33:53.233 --> 03:33:55.577
<v Josh Sparkes>here's the categories.
Here's the deadline.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1077-0
03:33:55.777 --> 03:33:56.177
<v Josh Sparkes>What one?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1078-0
03:33:56.337 --> 03:34:00.943
<v Josh Sparkes>Are you proceeding with so they go and
have a conversation with their legal</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1078-1
03:34:00.943 --> 03:34:05.367
<v Josh Sparkes>teams to agree the way forward.
What's what categories are we submitting</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1078-2
03:34:05.367 --> 03:34:10.277
<v Josh Sparkes>to and and put into our work request for
the support that they require for that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1078-3
03:34:10.277 --> 03:34:14.762
<v Josh Sparkes>So when they confirm what they're
proceeding with and it's at that point,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1078-4
03:34:14.762 --> 03:34:16.217
<v Josh Sparkes>then you can it goes in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1079-0
03:34:16.297 --> 03:34:18.942
<v Josh Sparkes>The work request for for those that are
teams in policy,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1079-1
03:34:18.942 --> 03:34:21.217
<v Josh Sparkes>OK and then you start working on them.
Yeah. OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1080-0
03:34:22.777 --> 03:34:24.177
<v Josh Sparkes>It's another way with the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1081-0
03:34:25.297 --> 03:34:29.181
<v Josh Sparkes>PM and you think I'm CNG and you like how
this is? Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1081-1
03:34:29.181 --> 03:34:34.768
<v Josh Sparkes>So at this point when it's an exception,
it's going through me with the directors</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1081-2
03:34:34.768 --> 03:34:40.220
<v Josh Sparkes>of providing that historical information
on what is following out of policy and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1081-3
03:34:40.220 --> 03:34:42.537
<v Josh Sparkes>what our recommendations would be.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1082-0
03:34:42.897 --> 03:34:47.917
<v Josh Sparkes>Based on the last three years rankings,
what means an exception? As you said,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1082-1
03:34:47.917 --> 03:34:51.714
<v Josh Sparkes>as policy policy,
anything by three below for chambers and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1082-2
03:34:51.714 --> 03:34:52.937
<v Josh Sparkes>anything legal 500.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1083-0
03:34:54.697 --> 03:34:58.065
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, out.
So out of policy outside of the band.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1083-1
03:34:58.065 --> 03:35:03.799
<v Josh Sparkes>And what was the other one that you said
that they were all split there? Sorry.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1083-2
03:35:03.799 --> 03:35:07.097
<v Josh Sparkes>Hundreds. Just legal 500.
Blanket is awesome.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1084-0
03:35:09.257 --> 03:35:12.442
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
So then they come back and then say which</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1084-1
03:35:12.442 --> 03:35:17.774
<v Josh Sparkes>ones you're working on? Yes, we'll be.
I've been recommended to the director</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1084-2
03:35:17.774 --> 03:35:22.760
<v Josh Sparkes>group that this is based on the analysis
of the historical information.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1084-3
03:35:22.760 --> 03:35:28.300
<v Josh Sparkes>This is deemed exceptions or where we
suggest that you don't proceed based on a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1084-4
03:35:28.300 --> 03:35:28.577
<v Josh Sparkes>non.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1085-0
03:35:28.697 --> 03:35:32.132
<v Josh Sparkes>Banking for three years, for example.
That would,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1085-1
03:35:32.132 --> 03:35:37.834
<v Josh Sparkes>unless there's a new so exceptions to the
policy being like a new partner hire and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1085-2
03:35:37.834 --> 03:35:41.338
<v Josh Sparkes>or a new category would be deemed as an
exception.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1085-3
03:35:41.338 --> 03:35:43.537
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'd make that suggestion to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1086-0
03:35:44.457 --> 03:35:47.867
<v Josh Sparkes>The director group.
They would then have discussions with the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1086-1
03:35:47.867 --> 03:35:50.507
<v Josh Sparkes>chief,
the officer on what they want to proceed</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1086-2
03:35:50.507 --> 03:35:53.147
<v Josh Sparkes>with.
Following conversations CMG have had with</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1086-3
03:35:53.147 --> 03:35:57.327
<v Josh Sparkes>the legal teams on what they wish to
proceed with generally as they want to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1086-4
03:35:57.327 --> 03:35:58.537
<v Josh Sparkes>proceed with them all.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1087-0
03:35:59.057 --> 03:36:04.449
<v Josh Sparkes>And take that to head of region,
*** **** of region, buy in and support to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1087-1
03:36:04.449 --> 03:36:09.983
<v Josh Sparkes>Then go back with what is a confirmed
exception list that ask client can work</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1087-2
03:36:09.983 --> 03:36:16.013
<v Josh Sparkes>on and CMG. OK, so CMG work on their bits,
is that right or you're working some bits</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1087-3
03:36:16.013 --> 03:36:18.497
<v Josh Sparkes>together, you're working on so you.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1088-0
03:36:18.737 --> 03:36:22.750
<v Josh Sparkes>They know what they're working on and
you're dealing with the exception ones.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1088-1
03:36:22.750 --> 03:36:25.426
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that right?
If I captured that correctly? So no,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1088-2
03:36:25.426 --> 03:36:29.646
<v Josh Sparkes>we're just we're putting our suggestions
for what it's based on historic based on</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1088-3
03:36:29.646 --> 03:36:33.711
<v Josh Sparkes>data really is we're given suggestions,
but there could be anomalies as to why</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1088-4
03:36:33.711 --> 03:36:36.387
<v Josh Sparkes>they would potentially proceed with that
exception.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1088-5
03:36:36.387 --> 03:36:38.137
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's at the decision of the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1089-0
03:36:38.297 --> 03:36:42.384
<v Josh Sparkes>Region and the and that's an approval
process that is required. Yeah. OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1089-1
03:36:42.384 --> 03:36:46.417
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's outside of shareable today.
Yeah. And that would then inform.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1090-0
03:36:47.857 --> 03:36:52.662
<v Josh Sparkes>And instructs us as as client and CMG on
the proceeding with that submission.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1090-1
03:36:52.662 --> 03:36:57.592
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's not just a given that they just
go ahead with submission and exceptions</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1090-2
03:36:57.592 --> 03:37:00.980
<v Josh Sparkes>with with all of it before and the
exceptions as well.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1090-3
03:37:00.980 --> 03:37:05.170
<v Josh Sparkes>And to finally understand,
I'm just making sure that I'm explaining</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1090-4
03:37:05.170 --> 03:37:07.697
<v Josh Sparkes>that mate with what with what's in Skype.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1091-0
03:37:08.177 --> 03:37:11.694
<v Josh Sparkes>What's in scope? Essentially. Yeah. Yeah.
So, Jill,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1091-1
03:37:11.694 --> 03:37:16.565
<v Josh Sparkes>confirm back to us what is what is deemed
in scope from the exceptions.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1091-2
03:37:16.565 --> 03:37:21.909
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we can work on those and engage
with the CMG contacts in the same way</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1091-3
03:37:21.909 --> 03:37:25.697
<v Josh Sparkes>that we have done.
Then for those that were in policies</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1091-4
03:37:25.697 --> 03:37:26.577
<v Josh Sparkes>straight off.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1092-0
03:37:27.417 --> 03:37:31.879
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. And three and above chambers. OK,
Alex, you're going to say, yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1092-1
03:37:31.879 --> 03:37:37.159
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just going to ask a quick question.
Is there a document that sort of outlines</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1092-2
03:37:37.159 --> 03:37:41.874
<v Josh Sparkes>all those touch points as I thought
across the life cycle of some of these</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1092-3
03:37:41.874 --> 03:37:46.777
<v Josh Sparkes>things, I think we've all got the MPL,
yeah, process as a mail updates, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1093-0
03:37:47.057 --> 03:37:50.818
<v Josh Sparkes>Some of the other bits that we've not
quite finished, yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1093-1
03:37:50.818 --> 03:37:54.956
<v Josh Sparkes>because it's as much the,
I guess as all they see in hand off the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1093-2
03:37:54.956 --> 03:37:59.909
<v Josh Sparkes>piece in the external business decision
piece because a lot of it sounds as if</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1093-3
03:37:59.909 --> 03:38:02.417
<v Josh Sparkes>it's almost like expediential knowledge.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1094-0
03:38:05.057 --> 03:38:08.674
<v Josh Sparkes>What? What? What does the form look?
I can share. Well,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1094-1
03:38:08.674 --> 03:38:11.903
<v Josh Sparkes>today of all those touch points for that
process,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1094-2
03:38:11.903 --> 03:38:16.037
<v Josh Sparkes>what do you complete today in there when
that request comes in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1094-3
03:38:16.037 --> 03:38:21.205
<v Josh Sparkes>So the requests are put in for those that
once we've communicated that they can</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1094-4
03:38:21.205 --> 03:38:22.497
<v Josh Sparkes>actively work on it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1095-0
03:38:23.017 --> 03:38:25.962
<v Josh Sparkes>That today, yes,
the requests are would they would go in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1095-1
03:38:25.962 --> 03:38:29.527
<v Josh Sparkes>and inform what it relates to.
I don't know if you want to show them</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1095-2
03:38:29.527 --> 03:38:32.058
<v Josh Sparkes>directly,
you just see one of an example of that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1095-3
03:38:32.058 --> 03:38:35.003
<v Josh Sparkes>just as a there's a further breakdown for
the directory.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1095-4
03:38:35.003 --> 03:38:37.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Does this only happen once per year for
each directory?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1096-0
03:38:39.457 --> 03:38:42.249
<v Josh Sparkes>Happens once per year,
but it's throughout the year,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1096-1
03:38:42.249 --> 03:38:46.095
<v Josh Sparkes>so each one happens at different stages
throughout the year. Yeah. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1096-2
03:38:46.095 --> 03:38:50.627
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a different times for each directory,
but once per year for each directory. Yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1096-3
03:38:50.627 --> 03:38:54.737
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Once you just get one. It's like,
you know, or global. You would get one.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1097-0
03:38:55.457 --> 03:38:59.962
<v Josh Sparkes>Now for Global 500 you get one,
for chambers you get one could be any</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1097-1
03:38:59.962 --> 03:39:04.790
<v Josh Sparkes>time for each directory. Yes. Yeah.
And all those sub processes happen for</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1097-2
03:39:04.790 --> 03:39:06.657
<v Josh Sparkes>each directory as well, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1098-0
03:39:12.497 --> 03:39:15.647
<v Josh Sparkes>The sub categories under directories on
show. Well,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1098-1
03:39:15.647 --> 03:39:20.554
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just gonna see when they go in form.
Yeah. Open solutions. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1098-2
03:39:20.554 --> 03:39:24.431
<v Josh Sparkes>So if they want to, like,
submit the work request and ask us to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1098-3
03:39:24.431 --> 03:39:28.308
<v Josh Sparkes>help with the submission,
they will select open submissions and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1098-4
03:39:28.308 --> 03:39:29.217
<v Josh Sparkes>then they will.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1099-0
03:39:30.097 --> 03:39:35.757
<v Josh Sparkes>Scroll down and select the practise
industry and then they would let us know</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1099-1
03:39:35.757 --> 03:39:40.388
<v Josh Sparkes>the Directory's name.
So usually chambers is the preferred one</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1099-2
03:39:40.388 --> 03:39:44.137
<v Josh Sparkes>and then the submission area.
So for example like.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1100-0
03:39:45.337 --> 03:39:49.265
<v Josh Sparkes>The total economies and then they will
give us the submission categories,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1100-1
03:39:49.265 --> 03:39:53.141
<v Josh Sparkes>name all the directories because
sometimes it's not all the way with the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1100-2
03:39:53.141 --> 03:39:57.389
<v Josh Sparkes>same naming mechanism as we do every year.
Yeah, yeah, it can sometimes change.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1100-3
03:39:57.389 --> 03:40:00.097
<v Josh Sparkes>So if it's if it's not as above,
then give us the.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1101-0
03:40:02.337 --> 03:40:05.595
<v Josh Sparkes>That's all you need to give us the
category name so that see,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1101-1
03:40:05.595 --> 03:40:07.960
<v Josh Sparkes>that's a directory submission category
name.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1101-2
03:40:07.960 --> 03:40:11.954
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what links it back to the
directory to how we upload the submission.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1101-3
03:40:11.954 --> 03:40:15.213
<v Josh Sparkes>So that is important.
And they know that's that's a mandatory</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1101-4
03:40:15.213 --> 03:40:18.577
<v Josh Sparkes>field so that they have as much as it's
magistrate. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1102-0
03:40:20.017 --> 03:40:24.668
<v Josh Sparkes>No formats, but they would know. That's.
Yeah, it's an important one. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1102-1
03:40:24.668 --> 03:40:29.075
<v Josh Sparkes>What I'm trying to say, I guess,
is it's not a drop down because it can</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1102-2
03:40:29.075 --> 03:40:33.543
<v Josh Sparkes>change year on year or like a category
will split out into 3-4 different</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1102-3
03:40:33.543 --> 03:40:37.400
<v Josh Sparkes>categories next year.
But it was one category the year before,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1102-4
03:40:37.400 --> 03:40:38.257
<v Josh Sparkes>so there's no.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1103-0
03:40:38.737 --> 03:40:43.069
<v Josh Sparkes>Consistency to the categorisation you
drive the level of consistency for what</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1103-1
03:40:43.069 --> 03:40:46.845
<v Josh Sparkes>you knew last year and then you have the
other and that level, yes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1103-2
03:40:46.845 --> 03:40:50.344
<v Josh Sparkes>So like where we are here like this is
actually yes, yeah. OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1103-3
03:40:50.344 --> 03:40:52.955
<v Josh Sparkes>But beyond that to the specific category
name,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1103-4
03:40:52.955 --> 03:40:55.177
<v Josh Sparkes>that's where it can change year on year.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1104-0
03:40:56.857 --> 03:41:00.086
<v Josh Sparkes>And who's going?
Just remember who's playing in the school.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1104-1
03:41:00.086 --> 03:41:02.777
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's the CNG. OK,
so that's putting it in. OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1105-0
03:41:05.017 --> 03:41:05.137
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1106-0
03:41:06.777 --> 03:41:09.921
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
it'd be great to get a copy of this if we.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1106-1
03:41:09.921 --> 03:41:14.348
<v Josh Sparkes>And so that lands with you.
You've got all this information here and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1106-2

<v Josh Sparkes>then you start working on.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1107-0
03:41:18.737 --> 03:41:23.211
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, and if needed as well,
especially given this policy does get</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1107-1
03:41:23.211 --> 03:41:26.417
<v Josh Sparkes>reviewed and has done for the last three
years.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1108-0
03:41:29.297 --> 03:41:33.770
<v Josh Sparkes>A briefing conversation tends to happen
with the the senior manager,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1108-1
03:41:33.770 --> 03:41:37.141
<v Josh Sparkes>in particular for that area for that
practise area,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1108-2
03:41:37.141 --> 03:41:42.393
<v Josh Sparkes>just to run through their submissions,
what they're intended to do so as much as</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1108-3
03:41:42.393 --> 03:41:47.320
<v Josh Sparkes>it's coming through the form. Yes,

03:41:47.320 --> 03:41:48.617
<v Josh Sparkes>happens around like.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1109-0
03:41:49.097 --> 03:41:52.566
<v Josh Sparkes>Overview As opposed to just the actual
submission that comes in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1109-1
03:41:52.566 --> 03:41:56.942
<v Josh Sparkes>It's more about for that practise area.
What are you intending to submit and what</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1109-2
03:41:56.942 --> 03:42:00.678
<v Josh Sparkes>are you looking to put forward?
And then it goes up as it may be from</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1109-3
03:42:00.678 --> 03:42:05.161
<v Josh Sparkes>their side that they've got other people
allocated to working on those submissions.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1109-4
03:42:05.161 --> 03:42:07.937
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've maybe got Gemma,
but Sarah and Danny and.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1110-0

<v Josh Sparkes>That's just opening up one of those
examples. Was it? Let me see if I get one.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1120-1
03:44:15.683 --> 03:44:16.017
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1121-0
03:44:18.417 --> 03:44:19.297
<v Josh Sparkes>But there's something.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1122-0
03:44:22.937 --> 03:44:23.057
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1124-0
03:44:25.937 --> 03:44:29.057
<v Josh Sparkes>And Mark, you'll see this on the screen.
You can see this share. I can't do this.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1123-0
03:44:29.977 --> 03:44:31.857
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Following it. Thank you.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1125-0
03:44:39.817 --> 03:44:42.274
<v Josh Sparkes>It's quite difficult,
so in so unfortunately,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1125-1
03:44:42.274 --> 03:44:44.624
<v Josh Sparkes>actually it's interesting watching that
in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1125-2
03:44:44.624 --> 03:44:49.004
<v Josh Sparkes>So sounds you can get these categories of
work that you're not looking through to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1125-3
03:44:49.004 --> 03:44:52.316
<v Josh Sparkes>try and find one of them associated
moving directories. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1125-4
03:44:52.316 --> 03:44:55.468
<v Josh Sparkes>I can see you've got weekly reports,
you've got, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1125-5
03:44:55.468 --> 03:44:56.697
<v Josh Sparkes>ServiceNow is great at.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1126-0
03:44:56.977 --> 03:45:02.843
<v Josh Sparkes>Having those buckets of areas that you
have to work on rather than a long list,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1126-1
03:45:02.843 --> 03:45:04.897
<v Josh Sparkes>it can in a section for you.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1127-0
03:45:08.617 --> 03:45:13.549
<v Josh Sparkes>Don't worry about it. So it comes in.
I can see that there's some activity in</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1127-1
03:45:13.549 --> 03:45:17.154
<v Josh Sparkes>there, you know,
whether a briefing call is required and</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1127-2
03:45:17.154 --> 03:45:20.189
<v Josh Sparkes>then so it's in your here on your landing
page.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1127-3
03:45:20.189 --> 03:45:24.173
<v Josh Sparkes>What additional information do you then
work on at this point?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1127-4
03:45:24.173 --> 03:45:28.537
<v Josh Sparkes>What sort of tasks are you completing
that we just said before like?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1128-0
03:45:28.817 --> 03:45:35.302
<v Josh Sparkes>In the research and the bids you're going
through, you know creating documents.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1128-1
03:45:35.302 --> 03:45:39.679
<v Josh Sparkes>So what happens at this point when it
lands with you?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1128-2
03:45:39.679 --> 03:45:45.678
<v Josh Sparkes>What are the artefacts that you're
creating or you have to attach to them</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1128-3
03:45:45.678 --> 03:45:47.057
<v Josh Sparkes>communicate back?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1129-0
03:45:48.937 --> 03:45:52.630
<v Josh Sparkes>So. So yeah,
so they they would let us know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1129-1
03:45:52.630 --> 03:45:57.884
<v Josh Sparkes>for example, this one,
what kind of information that they need.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1129-2
03:45:57.884 --> 03:46:03.466
<v Josh Sparkes>So for example for this one,
they have listed out very clearly what</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1129-3
03:46:03.466 --> 03:46:07.817
<v Josh Sparkes>they are,
what exactly that they are looking for so.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1130-0
03:46:08.337 --> 03:46:12.341
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes they will ask us to provide
mental reports.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1130-1
03:46:12.341 --> 03:46:17.680
<v Josh Sparkes>A draught based on previous year
submissions and referee response rate,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1130-2
03:46:17.680 --> 03:46:23.390
<v Josh Sparkes>because we also submit a list of external
clients contact to the directory's</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1130-3
03:46:23.390 --> 03:46:27.617
<v Josh Sparkes>provider and ask them to comment on the
performance. So.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1131-0
03:46:28.217 --> 03:46:32.895
<v Josh Sparkes>But a combination of all. Yeah. So,
I mean, they tend to be like, for example,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1131-1
03:46:32.895 --> 03:46:36.212
<v Josh Sparkes>that, you know,
I'm thinking about reporting, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1131-2
03:46:36.212 --> 03:46:40.417
<v Josh Sparkes>when you're thinking about data,
lots of these could be drop downs are</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1131-3
03:46:40.417 --> 03:46:44.148
<v Josh Sparkes>they tend to use standard wording.
So top build matters. Yeah,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1131-4
03:46:44.148 --> 03:46:46.577
<v Josh Sparkes>probably actions or what they can select.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1132-0
03:46:47.737 --> 03:46:52.207
<v Josh Sparkes>From our service offering to support
those draught submission, yes,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1132-1
03:46:52.207 --> 03:46:57.138
<v Josh Sparkes>only clearly they look like you know from
now to date you know, so that's,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1132-2
03:46:57.138 --> 03:47:02.201
<v Josh Sparkes>you know it's a specific time frame and
matters that are included need to be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1132-3
03:47:02.201 --> 03:47:04.897
<v Josh Sparkes>within a time frame. Yeah lots of matter.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1133-0
03:47:05.337 --> 03:47:07.337
<v Josh Sparkes>References. Yeah, you know that. I mean,
that's.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1134-0
03:47:10.137 --> 03:47:13.207
<v Josh Sparkes>Referee responses rates from last year,
you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1134-1
03:47:13.207 --> 03:47:17.628
<v Josh Sparkes>so you've got category plus date.
You know there's you can do that drop</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1134-2
03:47:17.628 --> 03:47:21.680
<v Josh Sparkes>down and options on that.
I don't know whether there is a hundred</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1134-3
03:47:21.680 --> 03:47:24.137
<v Josh Sparkes>of those different things but certainly.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1135-0
03:47:24.857 --> 03:47:29.065
<v Josh Sparkes>Would you at least it could be a
combination. That's what we get.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1135-1
03:47:29.065 --> 03:47:31.870
<v Josh Sparkes>But that's what we can ask. Yeah. Yeah.
OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1135-2
03:47:31.870 --> 03:47:37.162
<v Josh Sparkes>And if there is other and they type it in
a date range that could form part of the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1135-3
03:47:37.162 --> 03:47:42.008
<v Josh Sparkes>next drop down list. So, you know,
you get those insights of how many other</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1135-4
03:47:42.008 --> 03:47:43.857
<v Josh Sparkes>things do we have if there's.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1136-0
03:47:44.497 --> 03:47:48.418
<v Josh Sparkes>Lots of the repeated others.
We can then just add it to the the</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1136-1
03:47:48.418 --> 03:47:52.034
<v Josh Sparkes>categories within ourselves now.
Sorry about our solution.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1136-2
03:47:52.034 --> 03:47:56.937
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you can provide a solution then,
but it could be that you get insights.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1137-0
03:47:55.257 --> 03:47:58.548
<v Mark Sedge>No, no, it's that's it's the right.
I would have said the same.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1137-1
03:47:58.548 --> 03:48:01.377
<v Mark Sedge>So it just reassures that it can grow as
they need it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1138-0
03:48:01.937 --> 03:48:05.559
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes. Yeah. OK.
So then you've got that information if</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1138-1
03:48:05.559 --> 03:48:10.994
<v Josh Sparkes>they submit the request via that form,
this is the information that they need to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1138-2
03:48:10.994 --> 03:48:15.086
<v Josh Sparkes>provide on the call.
So capturing that upfront that's I mean</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1138-3
03:48:15.086 --> 03:48:18.777
<v Josh Sparkes>that's the least you need, man.
You know the category.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1139-0
03:48:19.017 --> 03:48:22.234
<v Josh Sparkes>That they want and the date and the date
range.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1139-1
03:48:22.234 --> 03:48:27.664
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you find that you need anything else
is that is it? This is it, but not this.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1139-2
03:48:27.664 --> 03:48:32.088
<v Josh Sparkes>So not bit as well or not.
Like see where we've got ones that are</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1139-3
03:48:32.088 --> 03:48:35.708
<v Josh Sparkes>coming in e-mail because I'm thinking for
your minds.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1139-4
03:48:35.708 --> 03:48:38.457
<v Josh Sparkes>Going for the reporting as we also track.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1140-0
03:48:38.617 --> 03:48:43.868
<v Josh Sparkes>A lot of this on a tracker because we
need to do all the historical data appeal</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1140-1
03:48:43.868 --> 03:48:48.856
<v Josh Sparkes>we need to pull the last three years
rankings we need to so as much as it's</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1140-2
03:48:48.856 --> 03:48:52.203
<v Josh Sparkes>relevant.
Obviously in here it's going to be great</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1140-3
03:48:52.203 --> 03:48:57.389
<v Josh Sparkes>to have it all within the system and
consistent and all using the same method,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1140-4
03:48:57.389 --> 03:48:58.177
<v Josh Sparkes>but it also.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1141-0
03:48:58.257 --> 03:49:04.605
<v Josh Sparkes>Feeds the tracker of how we then manage
the directories out of the systems.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1141-1
03:49:04.605 --> 03:49:09.449
<v Josh Sparkes>What's that tracker.
Was it just the directories tracker,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1141-2
03:49:09.449 --> 03:49:15.297
<v Josh Sparkes>right? OK, yeah. Yeah. A massive exit.
Yeah. And it could be, I mean.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1142-0
03:49:17.377 --> 03:49:21.462
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe we touched on that.
So you export that and you just add</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1142-1
03:49:21.462 --> 03:49:25.284
<v Josh Sparkes>you're growing,
I mean service guys effectively where all</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1142-2
03:49:25.284 --> 03:49:28.974
<v Josh Sparkes>your data is,
is there information in that tracker that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1142-3
03:49:28.974 --> 03:49:32.137
<v Josh Sparkes>you don't store your show well today you
could?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1143-0
03:49:32.577 --> 03:49:36.319
<v Josh Sparkes>Put in service now? Or is it actually no,
this is its home.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1143-1
03:49:36.319 --> 03:49:41.122
<v Josh Sparkes>This is where it lives and other people
access it and that should remain in.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1143-2
03:49:41.122 --> 03:49:44.865
<v Josh Sparkes>That should remain there. OK,
it's used for other purposes.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1143-3
03:49:44.865 --> 03:49:48.421
<v Josh Sparkes>It's used that process in CMG user as
well. OK, alright.</v>

03:49:48.421 --> 03:49:51.977
<v Josh Sparkes>It's an I manage that one. OK.
You don't need duplicate.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1144-0
03:49:52.457 --> 03:49:56.289
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
it's just this could this is a subset of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1144-1
03:49:56.289 --> 03:50:01.182
<v Josh Sparkes>that information.
The other there is duplication I think is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1144-2
03:50:01.182 --> 03:50:06.319
<v Josh Sparkes>the the categorizations,
the time recording, the case IDs, OK,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1144-3
03:50:06.319 --> 03:50:07.217
<v Josh Sparkes>share time.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1145-0
03:50:07.937 --> 03:50:11.535
<v Josh Sparkes>We can just. Yeah, no,
we just the overall time, sure,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1145-1
03:50:11.535 --> 03:50:15.395
<v Josh Sparkes>I wish you can get from here. Yeah,
to feed as this. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1145-2
03:50:15.395 --> 03:50:18.862
<v Josh Sparkes>Obviously that's the things where there's
crossover.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1145-3
03:50:18.862 --> 03:50:23.377
<v Josh Sparkes>The best is then policy specific or. Yeah,
ranking based that's not.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1146-0
03:50:24.177 --> 03:50:27.567
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes,
that's not going to be the house for that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1146-1
03:50:27.567 --> 03:50:30.675
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's good. So it's been,
it's landed,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1146-2
03:50:30.675 --> 03:50:36.255
<v Josh Sparkes>it's assigned at this point as you're
saying you don't have auto assigned as a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1146-3
03:50:36.255 --> 03:50:39.504
<v Josh Sparkes>group.
You would want to then assign for this</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1146-4
03:50:39.504 --> 03:50:41.977
<v Josh Sparkes>one, it's going to need to then be.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1147-0
03:50:42.377 --> 03:50:48.109
<v Josh Sparkes>Distributed out to across the team,
so from the likes of Kelly being the SDE</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1147-1
03:50:48.109 --> 03:50:53.693
<v Josh Sparkes>on that side that she would then allocate
out. Here's the here's the list.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1147-2
03:50:53.693 --> 03:50:57.937
<v Josh Sparkes>So she's got the overall list of what we
need to submit.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1148-0
03:50:58.457 --> 03:51:02.888
<v Josh Sparkes>And then allocate out who is completely
much one, and it could be, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1148-1
03:51:02.888 --> 03:51:07.032
<v Josh Sparkes>not for phase one. So you know that.
And so you sort of confidence it's</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1148-2
03:51:07.032 --> 03:51:09.909
<v Josh Sparkes>working.
There could be that school matrix of how</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1148-3
03:51:09.909 --> 03:51:13.880
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be auto assigned.
But there are certainly you can assign it</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1148-4
03:51:13.880 --> 03:51:15.377
<v Josh Sparkes>to any member of the team.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1149-0
03:51:16.897 --> 03:51:20.557
<v Josh Sparkes>Across it doesn't sound that you
particularly need a client UK and a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1149-1
03:51:20.557 --> 03:51:23.528
<v Josh Sparkes>client Australia.
It could be that you know you're just</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1149-2
03:51:23.528 --> 03:51:27.772
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got visibility as a whole team,
you're just assigning it to a particular</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1149-3
03:51:27.772 --> 03:51:31.857
<v Josh Sparkes>class and within the team. Yeah, yeah,
the team and all that. Yeah, exactly.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1150-0
03:51:32.417 --> 03:51:36.057
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so now it's in been assigned and it went.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1151-0
03:51:33.537 --> 03:51:36.657
<v Parik Narain>I can. Sorry.
Can I interrupt for a second?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1153-0
03:51:38.497 --> 03:51:40.217
<v Josh Sparkes>How do you want to say something?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1152-0
03:51:38.857 --> 03:51:39.177
<v Parik Narain>Hello.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1154-0
03:51:41.017 --> 03:51:43.893
<v Parik Narain>Yeah. Deborah. Sorry,
I I just want to check if the source of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1154-1
03:51:43.893 --> 03:51:47.093
<v Parik Narain>data. I think you did ask the question.
I couldn't catch the answer.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1154-2
03:51:47.093 --> 03:51:50.758
<v Parik Narain>What are these directories where the
classifications etcetera are coming from?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1154-3
03:51:50.758 --> 03:51:54.377
<v Parik Narain>Are these excel sheets excel files held
somewhere or are these from a system?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1158-0
03:51:57.217 --> 03:52:00.641
<v Parik Narain>The open submission,
for example the service classification</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1156-0
03:51:57.377 --> 03:51:58.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that the rankings?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1158-1
03:52:00.641 --> 03:52:04.865
<v Parik Narain>and the previous screen which had all the
red fields with the drop downs.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1158-2
03:52:04.865 --> 03:52:09.318
<v Parik Narain>What are the sources for? For those?
Are these hard coded values or are these</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1157-0
03:52:05.217 --> 03:52:05.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1158-3
03:52:09.318 --> 03:52:12.857
<v Parik Narain>coming from a centralised platform
somewhere or a data store?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1160-0
03:52:15.817 --> 03:52:19.417
<v Parik Narain>For example, if you see the service class,
the service classification here.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1159-0
03:52:16.097 --> 03:52:16.817
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that a?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1162-0
03:52:18.057 --> 03:52:20.404
<v Mark Sedge>Patrick,
these are these are legal these these are</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1162-1
03:52:20.404 --> 03:52:22.337
<v Mark Sedge>legal directories. You know, they sort of.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1161-0
03:52:20.977 --> 03:52:21.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Is the game.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1165-0
03:52:23.977 --> 03:52:27.657
<v Mark Sedge>Not necessarily file directories,
if that makes sense.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1163-0
03:52:24.057 --> 03:52:24.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1166-0
03:52:29.137 --> 03:52:29.617
<v Parik Narain>And would.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1167-0
03:52:29.337 --> 03:52:32.217
<v Josh Sparkes>The legal so they'll be hard coded.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1170-0
03:52:31.017 --> 03:52:34.279
<v Parik Narain>Would we have access to those right. Hard,
hard coded right,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1170-1
03:52:34.279 --> 03:52:37.060
<v Parik Narain>hard coded or taken from a centrally
managed place?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1168-0
03:52:35.297 --> 03:52:35.417
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1170-2
03:52:37.060 --> 03:52:39.894
<v Parik Narain>Because obviously territories are
centrally managed.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1169-0
03:52:39.457 --> 03:52:39.577
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1170-3
03:52:39.894 --> 03:52:42.461
<v Parik Narain>I'm sure values will change as in our
platform.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1170-4
03:52:42.461 --> 03:52:45.777
<v Parik Narain>I think we can't have them hard coded,
need to have resource.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1171-0
03:52:44.177 --> 03:52:48.654
<v Josh Sparkes>So this is solution areas that characters
are the the categories.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1171-1
03:52:48.654 --> 03:52:53.336
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah the solution for each of the
directions they change every year.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1171-2
03:52:53.336 --> 03:52:56.457
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's not the same categories year on
year.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1172-0
03:52:56.417 --> 03:52:56.697
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1173-0
03:52:56.937 --> 03:53:02.491
<v Josh Sparkes>So ensure well someone loads them in
order for the PIC list to be available.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1173-1
03:53:02.491 --> 03:53:07.612
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't have that PIC list,
it's only at what is it practise industry</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1173-2
03:53:07.612 --> 03:53:13.022
<v Josh Sparkes>level and submission area. Yeah.
So the actual name of the submission they</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1173-3
03:53:13.022 --> 03:53:14.177
<v Josh Sparkes>have to type it.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1175-0
03:53:14.897 --> 03:53:17.813
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
that's so there's a submission area drop</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1175-1
03:53:17.813 --> 03:53:20.606
<v Josh Sparkes>down.
I think Robin Park is talking to here,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1175-2
03:53:20.606 --> 03:53:24.516
<v Josh Sparkes>banks and funds. That's standard.
That's a yeah standard list.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1175-3
03:53:24.516 --> 03:53:27.619
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's only that directory cast
category. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1174-0
03:53:24.617 --> 03:53:24.897
<v Parik Narain>Is it?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1175-4
03:53:27.619 --> 03:53:32.149
<v Josh Sparkes>Two categories they need to. Yeah,
they need to enter because it changes</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1175-5
03:53:32.149 --> 03:53:33.577
<v Josh Sparkes>every year, apparently.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1176-0
03:53:54.217 --> 03:53:54.457
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1177-0
03:53:54.497 --> 03:53:58.506
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll come back to that one,
but the submission area is standard drop</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1179-0
03:53:56.017 --> 03:53:58.759
<v Parik Narain>We can have a look. I mean, yeah,
it comes from.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1177-1
03:53:58.506 --> 03:53:59.137
<v Josh Sparkes>downs that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1179-1
03:53:58.759 --> 03:54:03.125
<v Parik Narain>It's fine if it comes from a standard
place which is managed, managed source,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1179-2
03:54:03.125 --> 03:54:05.812
<v Parik Narain>as long as it's managed and control the
values.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1179-3
03:54:05.812 --> 03:54:10.345
<v Parik Narain>That's all I want and that's all we we
need because service I can't be the place</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1179-4
03:54:10.345 --> 03:54:11.857
<v Parik Narain>to manage these in my view.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1178-0
03:54:11.977 --> 03:54:12.097
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1180-0
03:54:12.377 --> 03:54:16.819
<v Parik Narain>Because these are governed by something
else outside of the platform from legal</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1186-0
03:54:16.577 --> 03:54:22.344
<v Josh Sparkes>So these are the standard categories that
you're submission I think is a standard</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1180-1
03:54:16.819 --> 03:54:17.097
<v Parik Narain>side.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1182-0
03:54:21.697 --> 03:54:22.577
<v Parik Narain>Once a year though, right?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1186-1
03:54:22.344 --> 03:54:26.776
<v Josh Sparkes>known. They don't vary each year, do they?
Those ones? No, no.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1186-2
03:54:26.776 --> 03:54:31.981
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the directories submission
category name is the one that changes</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1185-0
03:54:27.617 --> 03:54:27.777
<v Parik Narain>OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1186-3
03:54:31.981 --> 03:54:33.177
<v Josh Sparkes>every year, yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1187-0
03:54:34.217 --> 03:54:35.057
<v Parik Narain>Correct. OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1190-0
03:54:34.257 --> 03:54:38.480
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a free text party because it's
certainly it's just you have hundreds of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1190-1
03:54:38.480 --> 03:54:42.210
<v Josh Sparkes>them. You couldn't manage it. Yeah,
I think from a user experience,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1188-0
03:54:40.657 --> 03:54:41.577
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, yeah, that's fine.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1190-2
03:54:42.210 --> 03:54:45.830
<v Josh Sparkes>it would be a good experience because
it's too long a list. Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1190-3
03:54:45.830 --> 03:54:49.177
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a good question to just confirm.
So thank you for that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1189-0
03:54:46.257 --> 03:54:46.537
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1192-0
03:54:49.857 --> 03:54:53.835
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. So we're at the, sorry,
can I just on assigning the cases once</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1191-0
03:54:50.337 --> 03:54:50.577
<v Parik Narain>OK.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1192-1
03:54:53.835 --> 03:54:57.041
<v Josh Sparkes>it's assigned,
I'm assuming that the rest of the team</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1192-2
03:54:57.041 --> 03:55:01.673
<v Josh Sparkes>can still see the full transparency.
It doesn't hide it from you will be able</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1192-3
03:55:01.673 --> 03:55:04.404
<v Josh Sparkes>to.
I mean if you needed that to be the case,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1192-4
03:55:04.404 --> 03:55:08.442
<v Josh Sparkes>it was highly comprehensive,
but but in this case it will be it's a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1192-5
03:55:08.442 --> 03:55:08.977
<v Josh Sparkes>sign but.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1193-0
03:55:09.377 --> 03:55:13.897
<v Josh Sparkes>Anybody can open it. Anybody could see it.
The full team have transparency of all of</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1193-1
03:55:13.897 --> 03:55:16.768
<v Josh Sparkes>that and if you know the person assigned
is off sick,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1193-2
03:55:16.768 --> 03:55:19.268
<v Josh Sparkes>it's it would be really easy to use,
reassign,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1193-3
03:55:19.268 --> 03:55:22.246
<v Josh Sparkes>absolutely reassign even if or go on
holiday. You know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1193-4
03:55:22.246 --> 03:55:26.341
<v Josh Sparkes>it's it doesn't get assigned to them.
But on the day or even halfway through</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1193-5
03:55:26.341 --> 03:55:27.777
<v Josh Sparkes>the day, if they needed to.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1194-0
03:55:28.217 --> 03:55:32.938
<v Josh Sparkes>To go, it can be reassigned as well,
so it would be reassigned at the front,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1194-1
03:55:32.938 --> 03:55:36.923
<v Josh Sparkes>reassigned in transit,
or if there's a shift change and you need</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1194-2
03:55:36.923 --> 03:55:40.479
<v Josh Sparkes>to be done to go to Australia to follow
the sun 24 hours,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1194-3
03:55:40.479 --> 03:55:44.342
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be reassigned at any point
that's on track. So again,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1194-4
03:55:44.342 --> 03:55:45.937
<v Josh Sparkes>with new work in progress.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1195-0
03:55:46.257 --> 03:55:50.980
<v Josh Sparkes>And then what needs to be completed?
I think there was a briefing call</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1195-1
03:55:50.980 --> 03:55:55.438
<v Josh Sparkes>required. Is that right?
So that is that an activity that could be</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1195-2
03:55:55.438 --> 03:56:00.694
<v Josh Sparkes>the first point that you might get have
to gather some additional information.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1195-3
03:56:00.694 --> 03:56:03.555
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
that would be your expert can have a</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1195-4
03:56:03.555 --> 03:56:06.017
<v Josh Sparkes>briefing call but that's more across.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1196-0
03:56:06.177 --> 03:56:11.865
<v Josh Sparkes>All of the category submissions,
but there is the option at the category</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1196-1
03:56:11.865 --> 03:56:17.320
<v Josh Sparkes>level for the individual request or to
discuss that with the clients.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1196-2
03:56:17.320 --> 03:56:22.697
<v Josh Sparkes>Ask client team. Yeah. Yeah. OK.
So so they they're requesting that.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1197-0
03:56:24.137 --> 03:56:28.437
<v Josh Sparkes>That we can call is required. That's it.
Yeah. OK, that's fine.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1197-1
03:56:28.437 --> 03:56:32.604
<v Josh Sparkes>And if that takes place,
what information are they additional</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1197-2
03:56:32.604 --> 03:56:36.905
<v Josh Sparkes>information? Are they giving?
Are they just repeating what they</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1197-3
03:56:36.905 --> 03:56:37.577
<v Josh Sparkes>submitted?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1198-0
03:56:39.617 --> 03:56:42.111
<v Josh Sparkes>Of what is required? I mean,
are they just?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1198-1
03:56:42.111 --> 03:56:46.590
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that sort of almost for their own
confidence that they've had an intro call</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1198-2
03:56:46.590 --> 03:56:51.239
<v Josh Sparkes>to feel that the information that they've
completed on the form has been received</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1198-3
03:56:51.239 --> 03:56:54.925
<v Josh Sparkes>and understood? We don't,
I would say we don't tend to have that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1198-4
03:56:54.925 --> 03:56:58.497
<v Josh Sparkes>selection with the directories.
It's just part of the overall.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1199-0
03:56:58.737 --> 03:57:01.102
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
But it's not something that we commonly</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1199-1
03:57:01.102 --> 03:57:03.414
<v Josh Sparkes>see,
it would be done with a practise area</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1199-2
03:57:03.414 --> 03:57:06.371
<v Josh Sparkes>industry view.
It's something that you're not doing at</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1199-3
03:57:06.371 --> 03:57:10.242
<v Josh Sparkes>clients. I mean is available,
but it's not something that you're you're</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1199-4
03:57:10.242 --> 03:57:14.381
<v Josh Sparkes>doing the first level as look at the
whole area as opposed to the individual</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1199-5
03:57:14.381 --> 03:57:15.457
<v Josh Sparkes>submission category.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1200-0
03:57:16.097 --> 03:57:19.394
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so now you've received it's in your queue.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1200-1
03:57:19.394 --> 03:57:24.094
<v Josh Sparkes>No signs work in progress.
The sort of workflow then what happens?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1200-2
03:57:24.094 --> 03:57:29.215
<v Josh Sparkes>What do you you're doing the work outside
of the system getting all that</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1200-3
03:57:29.215 --> 03:57:32.863
<v Josh Sparkes>information,
what do you populate and show on today</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1200-4
03:57:32.863 --> 03:57:34.337
<v Josh Sparkes>once that's complete?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1201-0
03:57:34.697 --> 03:57:34.817
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1202-0
03:57:37.977 --> 03:57:42.663
<v Josh Sparkes>What additional information you capture
you know, is it it was, you know,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1202-1
03:57:42.663 --> 03:57:47.540
<v Josh Sparkes>we provided the following, you know,
maybe as a checklist that if you've got</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1202-2
03:57:47.540 --> 03:57:51.783
<v Josh Sparkes>those things that you can check,
each one has been done as you go.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1202-3
03:57:51.783 --> 03:57:53.937
<v Josh Sparkes>For example, matter rates between.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1203-0
03:57:54.417 --> 03:57:59.457
<v Josh Sparkes>State ones who check completed.
You know you can check them off 1 by 1.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1204-0
03:58:02.537 --> 03:58:06.655
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you were to reassign it,
maybe the advance to that if you were to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1204-1
03:58:06.655 --> 03:58:09.800
<v Josh Sparkes>reassign it,
they the person who's being reassigned to</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1204-2
03:58:09.800 --> 03:58:12.717
<v Josh Sparkes>knows that three out of the 8 have been
completed.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1204-3
03:58:12.717 --> 03:58:14.777
<v Josh Sparkes>They just need to work on quarter 8.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1205-0
03:58:16.137 --> 03:58:22.040
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think you can probably pull it back
to the what we outlined in the request.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1205-1
03:58:22.040 --> 03:58:25.538
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
as to what's been delivered being draught</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1205-2
03:58:25.538 --> 03:58:28.017
<v Josh Sparkes>submission along with the reports.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1206-0
03:58:30.017 --> 03:58:34.372
<v Josh Sparkes>Then that's provided.
But what will happen after that is</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1206-1
03:58:34.372 --> 03:58:38.728
<v Josh Sparkes>revision after revision.
Following partner feedback. OK,</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1206-2
03:58:38.728 --> 03:58:44.842
<v Josh Sparkes>so you do so all those great matters.
I think there were eight things that they</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1206-3
03:58:44.842 --> 03:58:45.377
<v Josh Sparkes>wanted.</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1207-0
03:58:45.897 --> 03:58:50.921
<v Josh Sparkes>You would complete them as a draught or
awaiting feedback or in draught</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1207-1
03:58:50.921 --> 03:58:55.457
<v Josh Sparkes>submission it go back,
it goes back to the original requester or</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1207-2
03:58:55.457 --> 03:58:59.225
<v Josh Sparkes>that feedback. Is that correct?
Is that the workflow?</v>

9c202813-2ba1-4a32-be4d-da71477d8887/1207-3
03:58:59.225 --> 03:59:04.319
