abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/13-0
00:00:03.606 --> 00:00:06.526
Gap of Costco and to.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/51-0
00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:09.236
Charles, back where charges should? Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/52-0
00:00:09.236 --> 00:00:14.170
Please so that answers the first one.
Costco is a mandatory unless unless there

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/26-0
00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:14.266
Yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/52-1
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.364
unless unless you reconcile,
maybe there's a reconciliation process

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/52-2
00:00:18.364 --> 00:00:23.236
that you might challenge the cost code.
No. So that so that fixes that bit of.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/54-0
00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:24.896
There was.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/64-0
00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:31.236
In case in case of you have to wait for
it is.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/70-0
00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:34.566
Oh, right.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/72-0
00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:35.496
In that that's like.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/89-0
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.606
Short. OK. Yeah, because.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/90-0
00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:41.486
They're waiting for the master to be sent
out, but they still want.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/91-0
00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:42.286
To charge us.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/125-0
00:00:42.886 --> 00:00:48.504
Definitely as a way forward would like to
see that as a mandatory set piece on any

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/125-1
00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:50.806
room bookings for a managed space.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/126-0
00:00:50.806 --> 00:00:53.786
So would a room. You could,
if we go back to the rules,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/126-1
00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:56.766
you could book a room because the matter
is not set up.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/136-0
00:00:58.536 --> 00:01:00.136
So that's probably the exception.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/139-0
00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:01.736
But do you know that's the first things?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/140-0
00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:02.256
Of my heart.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/145-0
00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:04.216
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/158-0
00:01:04.136 --> 00:01:05.536
It happened. OK, I'll even I.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/159-0
00:01:05.536 --> 00:01:07.216
Wouldn't even see that actually.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/160-0
00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:10.096
I could just flag on the dashboard that
matter.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/210-0
00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:15.359
You know not well. Again,
that's where the integrations.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/210-1
00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.882
There's a bigger, wider conversation.
If Alex is here and say is it with three

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/210-2
00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:24.520
E that's AI think that we've got across
the board that there is stuff that is in

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/210-3
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.157
three E that we part of the integration
that we could look up that the matter is

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/210-4
00:01:29.157 --> 00:01:30.016
not even there.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/251-0
00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:33.539
And you know,
and therefore it becomes a valid,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/251-1
00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.303
you know,
not that they haven't entered it is the

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/251-2
00:01:36.303 --> 00:01:40.614
fact that it hasn't been created yet.
It's part of the report and we might be

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/251-3
00:01:40.614 --> 00:01:43.046
once those integrations has been
finalised,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/251-4
00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:46.086
it's a wise across the whole project
that's something.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/279-0
00:01:46.896 --> 00:01:49.495
We could pull or at least validate
against.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/279-1
00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:53.336
I should say it's an exception to the
rule that you reconfigure.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/286-0
00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:54.658
Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's it.
But see that scenario. Sorry.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/286-1
00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:56.306
Did you see it wasn't created?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/288-0
00:01:56.646 --> 00:01:57.726
No, actually they say.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/295-0
00:02:00.696 --> 00:02:01.816
OK. Yeah, it wasn't actually.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/325-0
00:02:03.746 --> 00:02:07.013
Yeah, OK. Yeah.
So the hospitality reports means good

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/325-1
00:02:07.013 --> 00:02:10.220
intro into that.
So your maybe the pain point of not

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/325-2
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.636
having the codes on the matter, yes,
but that's been alleviated from the

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/327-0
00:02:13.956 --> 00:02:14.356
Fraction.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/325-3
00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:15.786
requester up front.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/355-0
00:02:16.696 --> 00:02:21.389
And then from that report you then do
what? So you look up yet.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/355-1
00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.716
So right now the process would be that of
all the matters,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/355-2
00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:30.336
of course has been uploaded.
We would just say that we need to

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/355-3
00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:31.216
accountable.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/382-0
00:02:31.816 --> 00:02:33.976
So and where do you run that report?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/383-0
00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:35.656
From hey my day.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/384-0
00:02:36.536 --> 00:02:40.816
Oh, OK. Yeah. OK. So every room. Every.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/385-0
00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:44.393
Any chargeable items,
so basically anything that's been

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/385-1
00:02:44.393 --> 00:02:47.016
chargeable which catering and any
services.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/392-0
00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:51.376
So, so waitress. Waiter.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/389-0
00:02:49.496 --> 00:02:50.456
And that's something.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/436-0
00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:52.776
Oh oh, I.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/437-0
00:02:52.776 --> 00:02:56.057
See what time? Yep.
Suppose that could be captured up front,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/406-0
00:02:55.746 --> 00:02:56.186
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/437-1
00:02:56.057 --> 00:02:59.607
couldn't it? So, I mean,
I'm just thinking that you could loss of

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/437-2
00:02:59.607 --> 00:03:02.726
those details,
but we've talked so in ServiceNow already.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/437-3
00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:03.856
So you could run the.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/438-0
00:03:03.856 --> 00:03:06.580
Report. I mean,
it could be just sent to billing.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/438-1
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.176
They can access it because the reports
that that detail is there.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/488-0
00:03:10.126 --> 00:03:15.910
I think that it was also hospitality.
We need to be looked down because he

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/488-1
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.926
updates that with fees consumption.
How many box wine have they consumed for?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/489-0
00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:26.463
The meeting room. Yeah.
So that's saying when we close complete,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/480-0
00:03:24.616 --> 00:03:24.736
So.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/489-1
00:03:26.463 --> 00:03:30.406
there's some activity afterwards that
retrospectively, so we can add wine.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/510-0
00:03:30.846 --> 00:03:33.463
You know, there was some,
it's been cleaned.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/510-1
00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:37.185
This was broken hospitality,
actually said. We added expansion,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/510-2
00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:38.406
wine expansion check.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/523-0
00:03:38.566 --> 00:03:44.744
Post meeting checklist that could run so
that could be still part of an assigned

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/523-1
00:03:44.744 --> 00:03:45.126
task.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/569-0
00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:50.172
To hospitality,
if that's a discussion of whether they're

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/569-1
00:03:50.172 --> 00:03:53.467
one ServiceNow,
but they retrospectively complete that

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/569-2
00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:57.602
and that reports all that data sits in
ServiceNow, you know it sits,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/569-3
00:03:57.602 --> 00:04:01.917
which then could be auto assigned it
closed complete on the schedule to

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/569-4
00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:02.936
accounts payable.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/580-0
00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:06.936
And you can see here adaptive port time.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/581-0
00:04:07.336 --> 00:04:09.416
Yes, for the same partner.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/591-0
00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:14.056
That one's the one person, one meeting,
1 catering.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/609-0
00:04:18.296 --> 00:04:21.989
So that's something could be automated.
You know,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/609-1
00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.496
the fact that it's so the effective end
date of the meeting.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/632-0
00:04:27.156 --> 00:04:31.417
And catering goes in.
They've triggered the, you know,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/632-1
00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:36.996
it's end daily clear they they can add
those details what was consumed.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/673-0
00:04:38.536 --> 00:04:39.376
Or what takes you that was.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/674-0
00:04:39.376 --> 00:04:40.016
That when you would.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/675-0
00:04:40.016 --> 00:04:40.336
Have to.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/676-0
00:04:40.336 --> 00:04:43.256
Activate to automate the report from no.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/677-0
00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:46.622
So I'm just saying that after the
effective end date of the meeting,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/677-1
00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:50.527
you know we clean the stuff gone and they
could note their notes of state of the

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/677-2
00:04:50.527 --> 00:04:52.456
room while we, there's a few checklists.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/690-0
00:04:54.056 --> 00:04:57.885
If you mentioned hospitality,
going of what's actually been to and then

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/690-1
00:04:57.885 --> 00:04:58.896
it all gets closed.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/709-0
00:04:59.276 --> 00:05:04.222
So this is a complete task that
everyone's seen reception again,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/709-1
00:05:04.222 --> 00:05:08.636
they're activities that we discussed
today and that date.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/741-0
00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:14.175
Or that task could also be assigned or
that data could be assigned to accounts

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/741-1
00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:16.452
payable.
So anytime they don't have to wait for a

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/741-2
00:05:16.452 --> 00:05:18.821
schedule,
they could just run it themselves because

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/741-3
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:20.416
the data is then available to them.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/749-0
00:05:22.316 --> 00:05:25.116
So charge code and what what needs to be
charged?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/788-0
00:05:26.656 --> 00:05:27.536
But how would it be what you?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/789-0
00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:27.976
Get with the.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/790-0
00:05:27.976 --> 00:05:30.696
Other how can they run the report if it's
come off?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/791-0
00:05:30.776 --> 00:05:34.339
MRI well, I'm saying,
but all those details already in

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/791-1
00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:38.616
ServiceNow, do you know the room?
Do you know the catering? Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/792-0
00:05:38.856 --> 00:05:40.656
I can order else the report itself.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/803-0
00:05:42.536 --> 00:05:42.936
Is it gets.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/804-0
00:05:42.936 --> 00:05:44.536
Up uploaded to three.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/805-0
00:05:44.976 --> 00:05:46.456
So whatever else on that report.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/812-0
00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:52.136
To upload to CD so but they not have.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/832-0
00:05:53.816 --> 00:05:56.606
Yes it what?
So let's have a look at the MRI report

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/832-1
00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:59.020
today.
So what details are on the MRI report

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/832-2
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.576
that accounts payables needs?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/839-0
00:06:02.736 --> 00:06:06.456
Name projects Costco.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/869-0
00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:08.696
I'm.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/870-0
00:06:10.776 --> 00:06:11.936
Thinking I'm just.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/871-0
00:06:12.536 --> 00:06:17.256
Trying to trying to think how it would
work in terms of have we what?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/872-0
00:06:17.496 --> 00:06:19.567
We could do.
Sure we don't have solutions it now,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/872-1
00:06:19.567 --> 00:06:22.839
but I'm just thinking that date is you're
already capturing it in the workflow

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/872-2
00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:23.336
service now.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/895-0
00:06:24.256 --> 00:06:26.706
Yeah.
And we've got other activities that we do

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/895-1
00:06:26.706 --> 00:06:30.739
with accounts payable because the masters
in three E that's where the Billings

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/895-2
00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:32.016
effectively is happening.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/896-0
00:06:31.126 --> 00:06:31.326
Mm-hmm.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/939-0
00:06:32.686 --> 00:06:37.268
Or the accounts payable activities have
link and that's what she decided.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/939-1
00:06:37.268 --> 00:06:42.097
You have an attached report, for example,
but you can then just give accounts

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/939-2
00:06:42.097 --> 00:06:47.112
payable made you the details in three or
in the event when integrations come in,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/939-3
00:06:47.112 --> 00:06:48.846
that data can be integrated.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/964-0
00:06:49.656 --> 00:06:52.335
Into 3, so maybe in touch with. I mean,
as you said,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/964-1
00:06:52.335 --> 00:06:56.328
you've already highlighted that lots of
that data that because of the workflow

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/964-2
00:06:56.328 --> 00:06:58.856
today we've we've captured in ServiceNow
already.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/967-0
00:07:01.336 --> 00:07:02.296
And just say.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1011-0
00:07:04.126 --> 00:07:08.155
For context of the discussion that we've
got it all contained in ServiceNow,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1011-1
00:07:08.155 --> 00:07:11.556
so all that data is there,
what do accounts payable then need to

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1011-2
00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:14.433
enter into three?
Do you know that process afterwards?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1011-3
00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:15.166
What can they?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1004-0
00:07:14.836 --> 00:07:15.596
It's not, I don't know.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1012-0
00:07:15.606 --> 00:07:18.617
Know. OK,
maybe we could capture upon that because

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1012-1
00:07:18.617 --> 00:07:19.326
it could be.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1036-0
00:07:19.776 --> 00:07:22.456
Be that we give them Excel and gets
loaded.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1037-0
00:07:22.456 --> 00:07:26.056
Or that is,
that's why it's an exhibition achieve.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1068-0
00:07:23.546 --> 00:07:26.972
Yes, yes, yes.
Or and that in itself is a future

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1068-1
00:07:26.972 --> 00:07:31.097
integration that they need to then charge
these, you know,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1068-2
00:07:31.097 --> 00:07:34.522
add additional hospitality items to that
charge.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1068-3
00:07:34.522 --> 00:07:39.906
You know if that's probably what they do
is that line items and then add it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1073-0
00:07:40.856 --> 00:07:41.296
Charge coach.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1072-0
00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:41.276
No.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1077-0
00:07:43.336 --> 00:07:44.176
Any charges brought.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1112-0
00:07:45.776 --> 00:07:48.723
On the special that we send in a weekly
basis,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1089-0
00:07:48.086 --> 00:07:50.006
Yes, just added.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1112-1
00:07:48.723 --> 00:07:52.736
that's that's no other charges could be
done that week because.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1113-0
00:07:52.936 --> 00:07:53.696
It usually basis.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1098-0
00:07:52.976 --> 00:07:53.336
Butts.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1114-0
00:07:53.696 --> 00:07:56.709
Yeah,
but they then they're just uploaded

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1115-0
00:07:55.336 --> 00:07:57.856
They just upload that and then yeah, OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1114-1
00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.216
against it. Yeah. OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1136-0
00:07:59.116 --> 00:08:02.178
OK.
But I would say that the the data that

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1136-1
00:08:02.178 --> 00:08:07.876
we're capturing within the ServiceNow is
sufficient, you know, particularly if.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1137-0
00:08:07.876 --> 00:08:07.916
I.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1138-0
00:08:08.316 --> 00:08:08.996
Mean this?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1146-0
00:08:09.236 --> 00:08:11.316
Like the information out front, yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1177-0
00:08:10.766 --> 00:08:14.080
Yeah,
applying the information up front and

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1177-1
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.975
those posts post complete tasks.
So from hospitality they go in.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1177-2
00:08:18.975 --> 00:08:24.925
So they would get an effective end date
based on those meeting room categories

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1177-3
00:08:24.925 --> 00:08:26.206
that our clients.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1180-0
00:08:27.016 --> 00:08:27.096
Catering.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1202-0
00:08:28.856 --> 00:08:32.090
That's the best. The walls, isn't it?
They're they're the ones.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1202-1
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.971
So wine particularly,
is the one decided to client ones.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1202-2
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:37.296
They're not added for training,
are they all?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1221-0
00:08:39.896 --> 00:08:44.594
Right, OK, OK. But that's captured up.
So we probably didn't touch upon that

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1221-1
00:08:44.594 --> 00:08:48.256
this morning, but in that requested form,
it could be wine.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1259-0
00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:55.425
Beverages selected and that is depending
on you know usage can we return to the

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1259-1
00:08:55.425 --> 00:08:59.806
bank and they can say actually they
ordered 12 bottles.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1260-0
00:08:59.846 --> 00:09:00.646
We only had.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1261-0
00:09:00.686 --> 00:09:06.788
11 or 8 and that could be an activity
that they hospitality also get unassigned

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1261-1
00:09:06.788 --> 00:09:07.246
tasks.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1291-0
00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:12.397
After the effective end time of the
meeting, so we can capture all of that,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1291-1
00:09:12.397 --> 00:09:16.109
that sounds, you know,
it sounds like we don't need to duplicate

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1291-2
00:09:16.109 --> 00:09:18.622
it in MRI.
It's all there for the taking in

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1291-3
00:09:18.622 --> 00:09:20.736
ServiceNow and the report can be run.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1319-0
00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:27.297
On it's and that could be scheduled for.
You don't need to go in and say could be

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1319-1
00:09:27.297 --> 00:09:32.154
scheduled reports. That's there.
Just tell us what columns you need and

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1319-2
00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:33.166
it's available.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1326-0
00:09:34.936 --> 00:09:37.536
Would that be able to e-mail the people
who don't haven't provided 1?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1346-0
00:09:39.256 --> 00:09:45.112
Who won't have to,
because the cost codes and information is

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1358-0
00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:50.703
Yeah, they've already captured that.
So you've already headed off the pass

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1346-1
00:09:45.112 --> 00:09:46.456
already there.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1355-0
00:09:48.896 --> 00:09:49.936
Obviously you can't book.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1358-1
00:09:50.703 --> 00:09:52.126
offence, Peter, so.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1359-0
00:09:52.526 --> 00:09:52.686
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1366-0
00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:59.456
I'll just go through the accounts payable.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1372-0
00:10:01.136 --> 00:10:03.216
Just to check that process with them.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1375-0
00:10:05.066 --> 00:10:05.426
And then.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1394-0
00:10:06.816 --> 00:10:11.216
Is it worth Steven that in the Connect
folder just those kind of a look, yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1385-0
00:10:09.706 --> 00:10:10.066
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1393-0
00:10:11.696 --> 00:10:12.176
I'm just.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1395-0
00:10:12.496 --> 00:10:12.976
Let me just.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1401-0
00:10:16.256 --> 00:10:18.896
And they do that monthly, do they weekly?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1443-0
00:10:23.606 --> 00:10:26.366
Is there any other?
What was the two last 2 * 2 ones?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1444-0
00:10:26.366 --> 00:10:29.855
With it was 2.
It's an essentially the same process,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1444-1
00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:34.069
it's just different days.
But what you're saying is correct and

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1444-2
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:38.086
we'll have the mandatory information.
So we just say Monday.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1436-0
00:10:34.896 --> 00:10:36.216
Yes, I'll transfer you safe.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1480-0
00:10:38.896 --> 00:10:41.016
Would be Saturday and that's that.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1481-0
00:10:41.056 --> 00:10:42.216
Way. Yeah, that's the.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1455-0
00:10:41.246 --> 00:10:42.206
She's captured.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1482-0
00:10:42.216 --> 00:10:45.466
Same in Glasgow, London, not Glasgow,
just London,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1482-1
00:10:45.466 --> 00:10:50.181
and that's supposed to be talked about
today. Yeah. OK. What do you feel?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1482-2
00:10:50.181 --> 00:10:53.176
Schedule. Then?
I want wine in their meetings.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1486-0
00:10:54.936 --> 00:10:55.776
Oppositions, they do that.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1489-0
00:10:56.546 --> 00:10:56.826
But.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1516-0
00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:02.664
Would you want transparency that so could
operate?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1516-1
00:11:02.664 --> 00:11:06.759
Did you want operations to be taught?
Doesn't work as London.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1516-2
00:11:06.759 --> 00:11:10.656
It's not a client based in Glasgow,
so essentially people.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1520-0
00:11:14.076 --> 00:11:16.036
Right. It's not client base.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1524-0
00:11:17.586 --> 00:11:19.026
So they can't do the operations.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1567-0
00:11:20.706 --> 00:11:23.026
Directly and it's got a Costco if they
can ask for.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1568-0
00:11:23.746 --> 00:11:26.353
OK.
It just I mean it could be that these

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1568-1
00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:29.085
processes are made available to
operations.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1568-2
00:11:29.085 --> 00:11:32.375
You know it's just the assigned to,
but you'll have,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1568-3
00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:35.666
I mean if you wanted transparency of
activity maybe?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1597-0
00:11:35.646 --> 00:11:40.406
I think it's it's,
it's so separate and like classical.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1597-1
00:11:40.406 --> 00:11:45.931
So in terms of care and because you've
got the caffeine as well,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1597-2
00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:48.566
so that'll be handled, Caitlyn.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1601-0
00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:50.416
That.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1629-0
00:11:50.456 --> 00:11:54.335
OK.
Because it's accounts payable obviously

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1629-1
00:11:54.335 --> 00:12:01.034
were when we did the meeting was not
Glasgow, London, Australia, it was UK,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1629-2
00:12:01.034 --> 00:12:04.296
Australia, you know their activities.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1663-0
00:12:06.266 --> 00:12:09.519
You know who does what?
They wasn't separated by physical

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1663-1
00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:12.100
location.
It was done by two the two regions.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1663-2
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.307
So they what you're saying is that they
don't get involved in the Glasgow.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1663-3
00:12:16.307 --> 00:12:20.346
It doesn't exist for them to be involved
in essentially, is that right?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1666-0
00:12:21.316 --> 00:12:21.756
OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1679-0
00:12:21.956 --> 00:12:25.756
Mm-hmm. OK, I understand.
I think the whole report is never covered.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1693-0
00:12:26.756 --> 00:12:31.016
But it doesn't exist essentially,
and then probably moving into Paris,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1693-1
00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:33.956
which is probably wine at lunch at all
meetings.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1702-0
00:12:35.586 --> 00:12:39.826
So would they want to probably follow the
London model? Are they client base?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1738-0
00:12:42.876 --> 00:12:44.742
OK.
And that's scalable that they can go

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1738-1
00:12:44.742 --> 00:12:45.516
through the same?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1716-0
00:12:45.796 --> 00:12:46.596
But when?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1739-0
00:12:45.876 --> 00:12:46.196
I think.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1740-0
00:12:47.596 --> 00:12:52.876
It's it's next year, next year.
So we are going to be getting this year

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1721-0
00:12:51.066 --> 00:12:51.106
I.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1740-1
00:12:52.876 --> 00:12:57.276
at some point taking their bookings and
their offices have.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1742-0
00:12:58.016 --> 00:12:58.056
Now.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1761-0
00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:05.733
Process and what the actual, the etcetera.
But it's it's a small office in terms of

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1761-1
00:13:05.733 --> 00:13:08.536
client base. So yeah, it's going to be.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1764-0
00:13:10.136 --> 00:13:10.456
Services.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1782-0
00:13:12.816 --> 00:13:13.056
OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1783-0
00:13:13.616 --> 00:13:16.359
And the accounts payable enforcing that
charge back.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1783-1
00:13:16.359 --> 00:13:18.896
That's why when we come to write offs,
isn't it?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1806-0
00:13:18.866 --> 00:13:21.586
No, I said my office completely different,
I said.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1789-0
00:13:20.986 --> 00:13:21.666
OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1807-0
00:13:21.586 --> 00:13:26.164
It so accounts payable will say this.
Do they enforce that this is how much you

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1807-1
00:13:26.164 --> 00:13:29.426
on the client matter number?
This is how much you spend.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1824-0
00:13:31.536 --> 00:13:36.144
No, no. Is it just? OK?
So maybe you're surprised purposes of.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1824-1
00:13:36.144 --> 00:13:39.216
Why did you collect all that data upfront?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1842-0
00:13:40.976 --> 00:13:41.736
So they did not.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1843-0
00:13:41.736 --> 00:13:44.204
To be able to charge it back,
do you know what I mean?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1843-1
00:13:44.204 --> 00:13:45.416
Is it just when accounting?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1870-0
00:13:45.006 --> 00:13:47.858
So that must be just like any team as
well.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1870-1
00:13:47.858 --> 00:13:52.784
So the chargeback obviously goes to
departmental and it's obviously who was

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1870-2
00:13:52.784 --> 00:13:57.322
in charge of that. But Chip,
why are they spending all this money but

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1870-3
00:13:57.322 --> 00:13:57.646
they?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1884-0
00:13:59.346 --> 00:14:03.382
'Re so you're charging the client fee.
Obviously we need to pay for what?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1884-1
00:14:03.382 --> 00:14:04.146
The vet. What?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1885-0
00:14:04.146 --> 00:14:04.386
The.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1891-0
00:14:06.706 --> 00:14:07.026
But essentially.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1916-0
00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:09.166
Add it to the clients filling.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1903-0
00:14:10.026 --> 00:14:10.826
The bottle number would.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1904-0
00:14:10.826 --> 00:14:12.426
Be the current bill if yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1917-0
00:14:11.766 --> 00:14:13.046
Filling. And so they added.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1918-0
00:14:13.806 --> 00:14:16.366
Yeah, I mean, goes to one of the finance.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1946-0
00:14:19.976 --> 00:14:22.536
And they can add that to the bill they.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1947-0
00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:26.456
Can add it to the bill or rings on right.
That's it. Wasn't that right? Because it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1935-0
00:14:24.306 --> 00:14:24.946
Right.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1948-0
00:14:26.456 --> 00:14:28.176
Sounded a bit petty, so excuse me.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1944-0
00:14:27.296 --> 00:14:27.616
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1954-0
00:14:29.626 --> 00:14:30.306
So these are.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1964-0
00:14:30.016 --> 00:14:30.176
So.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1965-0
00:14:30.376 --> 00:14:33.951
Are. So what's the rule?
If we think about business rules on the

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1965-1
00:14:33.951 --> 00:14:34.336
system?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1997-0
00:14:35.196 --> 00:14:39.066
Anything that's associated with the
matter matter number,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1997-1
00:14:39.066 --> 00:14:43.404
including room bookings and catering,
is charged to the clients.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1997-2
00:14:43.404 --> 00:14:48.075
And if you want to write it off,
it's at part of the discretion or is

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/1997-3
00:14:48.075 --> 00:14:48.476
there?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2006-0
00:14:50.026 --> 00:14:50.626
Select.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2030-0
00:14:50.426 --> 00:14:55.492
But it is assumed that these types of
this final hospitality that room booking

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2030-1
00:14:55.492 --> 00:15:00.623
and anything associated with the client
against some massive number is going to

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2030-2
00:15:00.623 --> 00:15:01.906
be charged. Yes, OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2064-0
00:15:02.696 --> 00:15:03.336
Is it worth?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2065-0
00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:06.615
Sorry analyst other ones.
Your integration with billing because

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2065-1
00:15:06.615 --> 00:15:09.535
that's what all the reversals are there
to improve, yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2065-2
00:15:09.535 --> 00:15:13.326
But maybe there needs to be something
where the partner says whether it's

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2065-3
00:15:13.326 --> 00:15:13.736
written.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2066-0
00:15:14.056 --> 00:15:16.656
Or not, or absorbed by their IP out.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2081-0
00:15:17.736 --> 00:15:20.976
What we've discussed who's what?
Right has he got all you know?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2117-0
00:15:19.546 --> 00:15:23.887
Yeah, yeah, that's.
I can't remember what they said because

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2093-0
00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.656
If it's.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2117-1
00:15:23.887 --> 00:15:27.866
that's what I remember that they they
said it's quite.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2101-0
00:15:26.656 --> 00:15:26.696
About.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2118-0
00:15:27.866 --> 00:15:30.026
Manual, but they have to go in and do it.
But there's a way.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2120-0
00:15:30.026 --> 00:15:31.826
We can automate there like.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2124-0
00:15:32.506 --> 00:15:33.666
From from business tools, yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2137-0
00:15:33.826 --> 00:15:36.721
Yeah, it's. I don't know.
It's just like the new joiner stuff you

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2137-1
00:15:36.721 --> 00:15:37.906
said before, like, I think.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2151-0
00:15:39.746 --> 00:15:43.466
OK, but that report needs to go to them,
which, as I said, if all the details.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2183-0
00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:43.836
And.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2184-0
00:15:45.276 --> 00:15:48.637
In the system that could be auto
generated,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2184-1
00:15:48.637 --> 00:15:53.756
you provided and they'll be notified that
the report is available.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2185-0
00:15:54.076 --> 00:15:54.796
At that point.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2186-0
00:15:55.476 --> 00:15:57.757
And that's that's easy for an assignment
group,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2186-1
00:15:57.757 --> 00:16:00.276
because it goes to accounts payable UK
because they.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2208-0
00:16:01.496 --> 00:16:06.774
They they've got some global activity,
but they've also got the UK List 1.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2208-1
00:16:06.774 --> 00:16:11.279
So that's a good win that you probably
wouldn't have to run it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2208-2
00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:12.616
It just runs it so.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2210-0
00:16:13.536 --> 00:16:13.936
Yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2214-0
00:16:16.136 --> 00:16:16.816
OK, that's good.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2244-0
00:16:19.606 --> 00:16:23.299
Is now a good.
So that's hospitality respectively going

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2244-1
00:16:23.299 --> 00:16:26.597
into count,
do they add me more to things that or

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2244-2
00:16:26.597 --> 00:16:30.686
does it just tend to be the consumption
of what was consumed?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2269-0
00:16:30.826 --> 00:16:32.546
Yeah. Any anything charge?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2270-0
00:16:32.546 --> 00:16:36.924
And they're different from catering.
So catering of the suppliers of it and

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2270-1
00:16:36.924 --> 00:16:38.826
hospitality are and what's there?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2288-0
00:16:38.316 --> 00:16:41.876
Message. No, it's it's it's the same.
It seems like it's just what it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2289-0
00:16:42.316 --> 00:16:45.236
So catering is. Oh, OK,
so not a different.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2290-0
00:16:45.236 --> 00:16:46.596
Assignment group no. OK, I.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2291-0
00:16:46.916 --> 00:16:48.436
Need to thank you, Tom.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2303-0
00:16:50.226 --> 00:16:53.703
He's not. He's not here.
The reason I ask is just because was the

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2346-0
00:16:53.566 --> 00:16:53.846
Whether.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2303-1
00:16:53.703 --> 00:16:54.546
question, sorry.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2347-0
00:16:55.206 --> 00:16:58.946
We have to choose a town,
so speaking with with Jill.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2311-0
00:16:57.106 --> 00:16:57.586
Oh yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2347-1
00:16:58.946 --> 00:17:03.726
So there's team are working on
definitions across the from different

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2347-2
00:17:03.726 --> 00:17:09.614
reasons. And I'm conscious that, you know,
last week and the people group we spoke a

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2347-3
00:17:09.614 --> 00:17:12.246
lot about whether it's the time spent.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2350-0
00:17:11.436 --> 00:17:11.556
Why?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2351-0
00:17:11.676 --> 00:17:13.276
Transition. Yes, it's in English.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2369-0
00:17:13.296 --> 00:17:16.715
These sorts of things.
So just there's just another example,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2369-1
00:17:16.715 --> 00:17:20.976
just off the back of it that we probably
need to just sit to this watch on.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2397-0
00:17:20.236 --> 00:17:20.476
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2398-0
00:17:23.036 --> 00:17:25.662
Understand what terminals you want users
are for,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2398-1
00:17:25.662 --> 00:17:29.076
and make sure that we're we're using
consistently on the system.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2399-0
00:17:25.666 --> 00:17:29.786
Last year? Yeah. Business. Well,
it's in my day's closest.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2409-0
00:17:32.096 --> 00:17:33.536
Yeah, because it just.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2411-0
00:17:32.306 --> 00:17:34.146
OK. Don't you do make.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2438-0
00:17:37.186 --> 00:17:39.066
Catering sounds are Subs, you.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2439-0
00:17:39.066 --> 00:17:39.306
Know.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2440-0
00:17:39.866 --> 00:17:43.751
Sub section of hospitality.
They would say that they probably do

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2440-1
00:17:43.751 --> 00:17:47.039
because they're supplying you,
said waiter waitresses.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2440-2
00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:50.506
There's some other activities in addition,
just the food.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2462-0
00:17:51.586 --> 00:17:54.562
Yeah, yeah,
because presumably they also have all the

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2462-1
00:17:54.562 --> 00:17:58.089
food coming in through coming up.
They have on a whole service,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2462-2
00:17:58.089 --> 00:17:59.026
monks themselves.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2508-0
00:18:00.586 --> 00:18:06.002
And that's probably another service in
our workplace, but of food coming in,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2508-1
00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:10.785
food going, tracking, tracking,
the whole eatery part of Asher. OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2508-2
00:18:10.785 --> 00:18:15.146
So hospitality is probably,
but we have to get that for news.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2509-0
00:18:15.466 --> 00:18:18.066
OK, I'm just checking this.
So we've got catering on the service

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2509-1
00:18:18.066 --> 00:18:19.266
catalogue for not hospitality.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2511-0
00:18:22.316 --> 00:18:22.516
OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2530-0
00:18:26.776 --> 00:18:29.290
Because it's interesting,
I thought I'd they didn't.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2530-1
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:32.136
It was worded as opposed as if they were
separate entities.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2532-0
00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:33.856
OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2566-0
00:18:41.226 --> 00:18:47.657
Is now a good place to do write offs and
it was write off reporting write off

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2566-1
00:18:47.657 --> 00:18:54.170
sampling and I've just sort of thought
probably worthy stop my brain going off

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2566-2
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.386
and trying to solute this guy got that.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2569-0
00:18:57.816 --> 00:18:58.696
Well, it seems like.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2573-0
00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:01.506
Itself as well, yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2581-0
00:19:03.786 --> 00:19:07.786
So we receive a report from the EE.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2586-0
00:19:09.896 --> 00:19:09.936
I.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2594-0
00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:17.356
Manually philtre out using a macros
spreadsheet to establish.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2602-0
00:19:19.056 --> 00:19:21.696
20 sorry to sample 28.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2609-0
00:19:23.856 --> 00:19:24.216
From.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2610-0
00:19:24.656 --> 00:19:26.056
150K.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2637-0
00:19:26.856 --> 00:19:33.682
The board and N as in over 150 K that's
been written off goes to the business

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2637-1
00:19:33.682 --> 00:19:39.370
managers that describe sheet as office.
So we just press button,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2637-2
00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.296
it creates the e-mail.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2641-0
00:19:42.266 --> 00:19:43.186
Tells us who's.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2644-0
00:19:44.956 --> 00:19:46.596
Only three even.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2647-0
00:19:48.696 --> 00:19:49.136
Right.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2654-0
00:19:50.776 --> 00:19:53.896
Extracted from three? Yeah,
in a date range. Weekly, monthly.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2673-0
00:19:55.626 --> 00:19:59.706
Yeah, every Wednesday? Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2674-0
00:19:55.816 --> 00:19:59.023
Weekly start of the week to the end.
You know every Wednesday,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2674-1
00:19:59.023 --> 00:20:01.416
Wednesday to Wednesday,
Wednesday to Thursday.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2677-0
00:20:03.256 --> 00:20:04.136
Extract it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2718-0
00:20:05.186 --> 00:20:07.826
The macros extracted the up from the
spreadsheet that we.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2719-0
00:20:07.826 --> 00:20:11.346
Received.
So you're looking at all room booking?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2720-0
00:20:11.386 --> 00:20:15.527
So that's nothing to do with room
bookings that came in finance.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2720-1
00:20:15.527 --> 00:20:20.113
So it's nothing to do with hospitality
room bookings, airport, nothing,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2720-2
00:20:20.113 --> 00:20:21.706
it's completely separate.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2721-0
00:20:21.946 --> 00:20:22.666
So click so.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2722-0
00:20:22.906 --> 00:20:24.946
What is it so this is?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2747-0
00:20:24.636 --> 00:20:33.323
So basically it is a task given to us by
finance to establish who is writing off

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2747-1
00:20:33.323 --> 00:20:39.436
things under 150K and who's approved them
and who's not.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2757-0
00:20:41.626 --> 00:20:42.226
And did not.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2760-0
00:20:41.786 --> 00:20:44.746
And that going to be done by system to do
it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2761-0
00:20:44.796 --> 00:20:45.276
Do you know?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2766-0
00:20:47.236 --> 00:20:48.196
That it sits with great.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2802-0
00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:55.511
It's been doing the heavy lifting in
itself because they're doing the new

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2802-1
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:58.427
upgrade or are they?
Is that thanks for you,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2787-0
00:20:57.526 --> 00:20:57.686
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2802-2
00:20:58.427 --> 00:21:03.286
this is something that probably falls
into. I'm not taking stuff. I'm not.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2802-3
00:21:03.286 --> 00:21:05.036
That's not my intention is.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2807-0
00:21:06.236 --> 00:21:06.796
Take it away.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2844-0
00:21:08.546 --> 00:21:11.930
Sounds like a system.
It's something that in so you would say

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2844-1
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:16.078
you would have a dashboard for these
types of activities that are above and

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2844-2
00:21:16.078 --> 00:21:19.680
below on what's been written.
So you would have it in the system.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2844-3
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.826
Should be doing that.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2845-0
00:21:21.186 --> 00:21:21.546
Shouldn't.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2876-0
00:21:22.086 --> 00:21:27.538
I actually put a change request.
I could a few months ago actually because

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2876-1
00:21:27.538 --> 00:21:31.463
I was looking at our processes and
they're right off.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2876-2
00:21:31.463 --> 00:21:37.206
After investigate and I thought we could
automate it, take away from the team.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2887-0
00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:39.076
All together because it's.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2888-0
00:21:39.076 --> 00:21:42.476
Not to do with booking occasionally, yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2889-0
00:21:41.196 --> 00:21:41.756
Almost.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2890-0
00:21:42.596 --> 00:21:43.596
This is seems like.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2909-0
00:21:45.146 --> 00:21:49.706
That when the music stopped, Yep,
connect with, you can have you.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2908-0
00:21:49.736 --> 00:21:50.576
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2910-0
00:21:50.706 --> 00:21:51.626
In the other.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2941-0
00:21:53.666 --> 00:21:57.963
That was part of the finance team.
Obviously everyone bookings were downs

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2941-1
00:21:57.963 --> 00:22:02.667
working the team, something to work on.
So that's why the process came in to ask

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2941-2
00:22:02.667 --> 00:22:05.629
connect.
But when I was looking at the process and

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2941-3
00:22:05.629 --> 00:22:07.546
I reached out to the stakeholder.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2945-0
00:22:08.626 --> 00:22:08.666
Because.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2956-0
00:22:10.306 --> 00:22:14.306
Whatsoever good on bank. And I was like,
do you still need that data?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2989-0
00:22:14.826 --> 00:22:21.226
Yes, I think you try and automate that.
Billy and I contacted Timidum St for PE

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2989-1
00:22:21.226 --> 00:22:26.506
Financial systems and I asked him the
question, can you give you?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2990-0
00:22:26.786 --> 00:22:28.506
Yes, yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/2993-0
00:22:28.546 --> 00:22:29.306
This task.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3029-0
00:22:29.896 --> 00:22:33.249
That sounds like a complete take it away,
you know,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3029-1
00:22:33.249 --> 00:22:38.344
workshop on why 3 E because you're then
feeding back that this is it should be

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3007-0
00:22:33.316 --> 00:22:33.636
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3029-2
00:22:38.344 --> 00:22:43.374
something that is on the dashboard.
It doesn't need to run a report Wednesday

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3029-3
00:22:43.374 --> 00:22:45.696
should it can be real time on there.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3032-0
00:22:45.076 --> 00:22:46.036
Yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3037-0
00:22:46.716 --> 00:22:47.716
So they know it's.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3034-0
00:22:47.826 --> 00:22:47.906
So.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3054-0
00:22:50.266 --> 00:22:52.761
Who do you think it's who?
You've won the report and you do that?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3066-0
00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:53.236
Abby, we even give it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3054-1
00:22:52.761 --> 00:22:53.706
Who? You then give it to?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3067-0
00:22:53.316 --> 00:22:59.556
So it's essentially we just mark up on a
shared master stretchy.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3068-0
00:22:59.596 --> 00:23:00.996
And then who accesses that?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3072-0
00:23:01.016 --> 00:23:03.296
That would be finance. It's Chris Hanley.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3080-0
00:23:07.946 --> 00:23:09.666
Chris is in.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3088-0
00:23:10.096 --> 00:23:12.176
No, it's just not passed. No, no.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3089-0
00:23:12.336 --> 00:23:13.536
It's fine. Options are you.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3092-0
00:23:15.826 --> 00:23:17.186
Phillips, Phillips OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3111-0
00:23:18.076 --> 00:23:23.867
But I don't know because Abby,
I can't remember her name last week,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3111-1
00:23:23.867 --> 00:23:28.636
but we'll actually working out this
process as a whole.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3115-0
00:23:29.436 --> 00:23:30.716
And essentially doing the same thing.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3120-0
00:23:31.666 --> 00:23:32.506
I didn't have it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3132-0
00:23:32.516 --> 00:23:35.862
No, it's a project manager.
I'll just check on that,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3132-1
00:23:35.862 --> 00:23:37.756
but she needs to go last week.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3157-0
00:23:37.766 --> 00:23:41.006
But it's a pretty it sounds like 3 could
do the the whole.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3145-0
00:23:41.396 --> 00:23:41.636
I mean.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3158-0
00:23:41.606 --> 00:23:44.510
It sounds like we take it out of here.
We do something. Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3158-1
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.806
And then we put it on the shared drive
and then.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3174-0
00:23:48.766 --> 00:23:52.486
But actually it could be attached.
It's there for the taking into.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3183-0
00:23:51.166 --> 00:23:54.682
Uh-huh. So, I mean,
I think they're looking at the process

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3183-1
00:23:54.682 --> 00:23:57.126
because I think they want real time wise.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3211-0
00:23:58.916 --> 00:24:02.608
I think they're looking, but they could,
but exporting it Wednesday to Tuesday is

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3211-1
00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:06.481
not real. I mean, it's there in real time,
isn't it? So you use it on the dashboards?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3211-2
00:24:06.481 --> 00:24:06.796
Really.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3248-0
00:24:07.386 --> 00:24:10.030
Of that day they get notified it's been
written off.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3248-1
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:13.523
They don't have to wait a week to tell
them it's been written off it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3248-2
00:24:13.523 --> 00:24:16.317
Once it's written off the notification
free to be sent.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3248-3
00:24:16.317 --> 00:24:20.458
I think that sounds like it should reside
in that system because that's where it's

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3248-4
00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:21.306
been written off.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3252-0
00:24:22.386 --> 00:24:23.346
Rather than you finding this.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3270-0
00:24:24.456 --> 00:24:28.204
This report very, very.
You should have seen it before it gets

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3266-0
00:24:25.146 --> 00:24:26.946
And if you're running a sampling before.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3270-1
00:24:28.204 --> 00:24:29.216
automated it was.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3304-0
00:24:30.916 --> 00:24:31.516
Asked. Yeah, I know.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3305-0
00:24:31.836 --> 00:24:35.916
I'm sampling a few, not all of them.
Do you know some you know.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3306-0
00:24:36.196 --> 00:24:43.634
24 under 150K there was over 150K live
with certain business managers or

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3306-1
00:24:43.634 --> 00:24:45.876
different departments.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3312-0
00:24:46.916 --> 00:24:48.476
Which the macro spreadsheet.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3316-0
00:24:50.516 --> 00:24:51.836
Automatically creates.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3358-0
00:24:52.416 --> 00:24:57.057
Essentially just saying that these
templates and then updating the master

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3330-0
00:24:55.386 --> 00:24:55.946
Because it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3358-1
00:24:57.057 --> 00:24:57.496
report.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3359-0
00:24:57.496 --> 00:25:01.727
It always sounds like in three that
writing off needs a root cause analysis,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3359-1
00:25:01.727 --> 00:25:05.409
and you already know why it's been
written off in real time. Yeah,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3359-2
00:25:05.409 --> 00:25:08.816
so it sounds like a process that should
reside within that 3.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3385-0
00:25:09.596 --> 00:25:13.233
Functionality because if you're only
sampling 20,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3385-1
00:25:13.233 --> 00:25:17.016
you know the volumes might be
significantly higher,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3385-2
00:25:17.016 --> 00:25:21.236
but and it's still not getting real time
anyway, so even.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3386-0
00:25:21.236 --> 00:25:23.596
You're going to see.
Does it just randomly?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3397-0
00:25:24.306 --> 00:25:26.786
You're thinking you extract them all then.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3402-0
00:25:24.676 --> 00:25:25.156
Sort of say.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3403-0
00:25:25.916 --> 00:25:27.876
Normal, so. And then we we get.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3404-0
00:25:27.956 --> 00:25:29.236
The full spreadsheet.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3424-0
00:25:29.866 --> 00:25:36.083
Or how many? It's like thousands. Uh-huh.
And then we want this macros to this is

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3424-1
00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:41.466
formulated. That's automatically.
It formulates and we get 20 samples.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3434-0
00:25:43.036 --> 00:25:45.756
By 150K under and then the business
managers.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3452-0
00:25:47.296 --> 00:25:50.841
Just to put that question to the service
counsellor says the top 20,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3452-1
00:25:50.841 --> 00:25:53.256
there's not the top 20 issues.
A sample of 20.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3453-0
00:25:53.206 --> 00:25:53.526
Yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3477-0
00:25:55.396 --> 00:25:57.448
Yes,
not withstanding the fact that over the

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3477-1
00:25:57.448 --> 00:25:57.996
service can.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3478-0
00:25:59.156 --> 00:25:59.356
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3479-0
00:25:59.956 --> 00:26:00.116
It.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3480-0
00:26:00.116 --> 00:26:03.639
Certainly sounds an opportunity that can
be done in real time in the system that

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3493-0
00:26:02.906 --> 00:26:08.590
They said build the macros for it.
I mean it was something two and three and

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3480-1
00:26:03.639 --> 00:26:04.596
it's coming from, yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3493-1
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:11.026
make assumptions that's checking.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3539-0
00:26:10.676 --> 00:26:14.095
Oh yeah, and that's what I don't know,
because since he's getting updated.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3539-1
00:26:14.095 --> 00:26:14.916
Is that right? So.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3540-0
00:26:15.516 --> 00:26:16.196
Yeah. Yeah, but.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3541-0
00:26:16.196 --> 00:26:18.396
We're also told that it's a functional.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3542-0
00:26:18.636 --> 00:26:21.436
Term there that we're not using at the.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3543-0
00:26:21.436 --> 00:26:26.589
Moment there's not even the regular it's
been switched on that there's a whole 20%.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3526-0
00:26:21.826 --> 00:26:24.746
To we used to know what that old champ is,
so.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3543-1
00:26:26.589 --> 00:26:29.718
You know,
there's stuff that could be utilised and

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3543-2
00:26:29.718 --> 00:26:30.516
not utilised.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3558-0
00:26:31.596 --> 00:26:35.577
But to your point,
it could be that you're already answering

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3558-1
00:26:35.577 --> 00:26:39.036
the question that might not be available
to do, but.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3564-0
00:26:39.986 --> 00:26:41.746
It's worthy of a conversation.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3587-0
00:26:41.086 --> 00:26:44.246
CE isn't able to do.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3588-0
00:26:44.246 --> 00:26:45.406
It all, and it's still needs to.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3589-0
00:26:45.406 --> 00:26:48.886
Be done so I don't know why it says
reviews feel like it's.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3616-0
00:26:47.266 --> 00:26:52.360
Yes. Can we get answering queries?
We can answer anything if you send them

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3603-0
00:26:52.156 --> 00:26:52.636
On several.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3616-1
00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.466
to it needs to be like finance.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3617-0
00:26:54.506 --> 00:26:57.306
It doesn't seem fine as it she doesn't
have.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3624-0
00:26:55.836 --> 00:26:56.676
Of you and it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3625-0
00:26:57.876 --> 00:27:02.236
Just one of these tasks that just.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3626-0
00:27:02.236 --> 00:27:03.276
You're helping out now. It's.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3653-0
00:27:05.186 --> 00:27:07.748
Yeah, I mean,
it could be well at the very least,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3653-1
00:27:07.748 --> 00:27:11.130
at least to have it on your dashboards
that you're working on it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3653-2
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.666
So you know when someone says you're 100%
of your time, you can say.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3668-0
00:27:15.786 --> 00:27:15.906
You.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3665-0
00:27:16.156 --> 00:27:17.676
Within which room booking you know?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3669-0
00:27:17.786 --> 00:27:19.506
You your landscape if you're weak.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3707-0
00:27:20.366 --> 00:27:24.407
Maybe is that it and like, well,
actually we also do these other tasks at

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3707-1
00:27:24.407 --> 00:27:27.411
least if you're capturing in ServiceNow
under connect,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3707-2
00:27:27.411 --> 00:27:30.524
you could have a task that says you know
we've run this,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3707-3
00:27:30.524 --> 00:27:34.510
it's right off report and it's allocated
a couple of hours of your time.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3707-4
00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:35.166
So at least.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3716-0
00:27:35.946 --> 00:27:39.346
For anything that you're doing in the
queues or the queries.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3736-0
00:27:40.946 --> 00:27:41.666
You you know you.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3737-0
00:27:41.666 --> 00:27:45.895
Can say well actually I'm working on this
and it can be reassigned someone else,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3737-1
00:27:45.895 --> 00:27:48.506
so at least it shows your during the week
we did.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3742-0
00:27:50.226 --> 00:27:51.506
One right off something.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3748-0
00:27:51.516 --> 00:27:53.836
Two, we also did 100 room.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3759-0
00:27:55.516 --> 00:27:58.196
For metrics of your time time management.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3777-0
00:27:58.006 --> 00:28:03.206
Yes, exactly creates the emails.
Is this e-mail to?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3760-0
00:27:58.196 --> 00:27:59.516
Your source productivity.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3778-0
00:28:03.206 --> 00:28:04.166
The people who wrote.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3779-0
00:28:04.166 --> 00:28:06.526
Off task or a question about it? Or is it?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3810-0
00:28:06.586 --> 00:28:10.650
What is approval emails?
So the emails that we send out,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3810-1
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:14.786
it's just for the ones for under 150K and
it's usually 2.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3811-0
00:28:14.786 --> 00:28:15.466
PS So we.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3812-0
00:28:15.986 --> 00:28:21.044
Would the emails created in this
spreadsheet and we essentially just send

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3812-1
00:28:21.044 --> 00:28:21.386
them?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3829-0
00:28:21.726 --> 00:28:21.926
But if.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3830-0
00:28:21.926 --> 00:28:22.206
They are.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3824-0
00:28:22.196 --> 00:28:22.916
To agree.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3831-0
00:28:22.446 --> 00:28:25.166
20th of how we made thousand will be
approved.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3866-0
00:28:24.956 --> 00:28:27.775
Yeah.
I just think why basically ask them for

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3866-1
00:28:27.775 --> 00:28:32.618
it to then approve it so we can mark up
our master spreadsheet to say get it's

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3866-2
00:28:32.618 --> 00:28:33.476
been approved.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3867-0
00:28:33.996 --> 00:28:35.556
But if they asked you a query on.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3868-0
00:28:36.116 --> 00:28:37.196
It. Yeah then.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3869-0
00:28:37.196 --> 00:28:39.236
You just by about it to actually doesn't.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3870-0
00:28:39.236 --> 00:28:40.236
Sound like it?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3922-0
00:28:44.646 --> 00:28:47.006
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Obviously the admin maybe.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3923-0
00:28:47.246 --> 00:28:48.006
I don't need any.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3924-0
00:28:48.006 --> 00:28:51.286
Follow-ups like see if they don't get
back to you. No, just let's you one.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3925-0
00:28:51.646 --> 00:28:54.764
Yep, 1 task.
So we'll send the e-mail after Wednesday.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3925-1
00:28:54.764 --> 00:28:57.202
Yep,
and then we'll check in the following

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3925-2
00:28:57.202 --> 00:28:59.753
Tuesday to see who's doing that.
And if not,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3925-3
00:28:59.753 --> 00:29:04.289
we mark up the spreadsheet to say it's
not approved or it has been approved and

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3925-4
00:29:04.289 --> 00:29:04.686
that's.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3941-0
00:29:05.876 --> 00:29:09.956
And you don't count 18 of them were
approved 16 of them.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3950-0
00:29:10.016 --> 00:29:14.254
You don't do any of that supporting well.
Twenty. No, not all.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3950-1
00:29:14.254 --> 00:29:15.936
We just up the MSR sheet.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3961-0
00:29:16.156 --> 00:29:18.196
Further, and how much?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3962-0
00:29:18.196 --> 00:29:19.476
Is them. Sorry, how much time does it?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3963-0
00:29:19.476 --> 00:29:22.276
Take to do 15 minutes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3975-0
00:29:24.636 --> 00:29:25.916
What I mean is it's not.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/3976-0
00:29:25.916 --> 00:29:27.516
Like 5 hours of your week.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4011-0
00:29:30.476 --> 00:29:31.916
It's one of the tasks.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4012-0
00:29:32.636 --> 00:29:37.389
Yeah. I mean, it's not a huge overhead,
but it certainly sounds ownership of that,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4012-1
00:29:37.389 --> 00:29:37.676
yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4013-0
00:29:38.076 --> 00:29:38.636
Because we talk.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4014-0
00:29:38.636 --> 00:29:42.454
About filled level data is the ownership
of that data throughout the whole

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4014-1
00:29:42.454 --> 00:29:43.116
organisation.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4041-0
00:29:43.986 --> 00:29:47.383
It doesn't sound like vital sit with
Kinect.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4041-1
00:29:47.383 --> 00:29:50.026
That's probably the great question.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4036-0
00:29:47.626 --> 00:29:50.546
Yes, yes, yes, it seems yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4042-0
00:29:50.306 --> 00:29:52.626
The fact that if you get queries you need
to send it on.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4061-0
00:29:52.466 --> 00:29:55.466
Yes, there's a lot of the.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4062-0
00:29:55.466 --> 00:29:58.248
Person apparently when I looked into a
few months ago,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4062-1
00:29:58.248 --> 00:30:01.586
so the person who created this process
and then like the company.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4063-0
00:30:01.896 --> 00:30:02.336
Hey.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4065-0
00:30:03.826 --> 00:30:03.946
But.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4071-0
00:30:07.746 --> 00:30:09.546
I was so it seems.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4079-0
00:30:13.186 --> 00:30:16.146
Just look at the spreadsheet and it's.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4080-0
00:30:16.506 --> 00:30:17.066
Green for goods.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4098-0
00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:21.136
And then what are the other use that we
have for just to?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4099-0
00:30:21.176 --> 00:30:24.656
See a point cause the 20 of you said
thousands like what does that even?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4104-0
00:30:23.656 --> 00:30:24.056
It did.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4107-0
00:30:25.536 --> 00:30:28.576
I didn't, so yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4132-0
00:30:28.556 --> 00:30:31.276
But it was like you said,
the top 20 or something.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4133-0
00:30:31.676 --> 00:30:32.956
That's fine, but it's.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4140-0
00:30:33.006 --> 00:30:35.046
If it's randall's.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4134-0
00:30:34.556 --> 00:30:36.276
Yeah, it won't. It won't.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4141-0
00:30:35.046 --> 00:30:35.606
Do you know?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4142-0
00:30:35.606 --> 00:30:39.555
What I mean Randall's record.
There's going to be so much more than

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4142-1
00:30:39.555 --> 00:30:39.846
2000.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4189-0
00:30:41.076 --> 00:30:42.076
When was that last time?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4190-0
00:30:42.116 --> 00:30:44.952
You reached out to see if it was
something that they still needed.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4190-1
00:30:44.952 --> 00:30:46.476
Was that recently? Yeah, it was was.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4191-0
00:30:47.396 --> 00:30:48.716
Even worth that wasn't even.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4192-0
00:30:48.796 --> 00:30:51.276
What I said that's personal year ago, but.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4193-0
00:30:51.276 --> 00:30:54.156
What I see is almost looking at the
process,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4193-1
00:30:54.156 --> 00:30:58.572
but I don't get any feedback from you,
at least on that week's Ajax.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4193-2
00:30:58.572 --> 00:30:59.916
I say OK in terms of.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4233-0
00:31:00.356 --> 00:31:03.498
And this task we can try and fill the
automotive.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4233-1
00:31:03.498 --> 00:31:06.262
I spoke to Ashley Portman to see if it
was,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4233-2
00:31:06.262 --> 00:31:11.415
if it was doable basically to get them an
expansive dashboard to see if there's a

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4233-3
00:31:11.415 --> 00:31:15.310
permanent who's not.
But there's a report could do it because

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4233-4
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.316
they don't have.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4255-0
00:31:17.436 --> 00:31:22.293
Their like the permissions or something
that we don't have the licences for.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4255-1
00:31:22.293 --> 00:31:25.636
We need to have this nice dashboard and
whatever so.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4262-0
00:31:27.596 --> 00:31:29.556
You see? Yeah,
we're still going to use that.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4298-0
00:31:30.506 --> 00:31:34.828
And I see what consider the Excel
spreadsheet ask what we can do dashboard.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4298-1
00:31:34.828 --> 00:31:37.502
So instead of looking at an Excel
spreadsheet,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4298-2
00:31:37.502 --> 00:31:41.938
looking at the dashboard to see who's
approving, who's not proven, they said,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4298-3
00:31:41.938 --> 00:31:43.986
yeah, OK, that's cool. We see if it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4351-0
00:31:45.756 --> 00:31:47.356
We're looking at this process.
It's not on at.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4352-0
00:31:47.996 --> 00:31:48.316
Home I was.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4353-0
00:31:48.316 --> 00:31:50.994
Like, OK,
so I left last report on to do the

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4353-1
00:31:50.994 --> 00:31:53.791
dashboard.
We're still waiting to be finished,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4353-2
00:31:53.791 --> 00:31:57.480
but in that meantime,
I'll be the project manager has reached

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4353-3
00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.991
out to see that looking at this task from
start to finish,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4353-4
00:32:00.991 --> 00:32:05.276
I don't know if they're going to
completely overhaul it, organise that.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4357-0
00:32:06.156 --> 00:32:08.916
And we so OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4365-0
00:32:10.056 --> 00:32:12.856
It's really redundant task.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4374-0
00:32:13.996 --> 00:32:14.596
Yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4372-0
00:32:15.056 --> 00:32:15.456
Yes, OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4375-0
00:32:15.276 --> 00:32:17.036
I mean your your difficulties gonna be.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4409-0
00:32:18.596 --> 00:32:22.516
Because you're saving 15 minutes a week,
that's the investment.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4395-0
00:32:21.816 --> 00:32:26.656
What is the purpose?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4410-0
00:32:22.996 --> 00:32:24.276
But it's more generally.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4411-0
00:32:24.316 --> 00:32:28.869
The whole end to end ownership of data,
you know there is each data.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4411-1
00:32:28.869 --> 00:32:32.036
If you think about it has a,
you know an owner.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4441-0
00:32:33.676 --> 00:32:36.355
You know,
and it's their roles and responsibilities

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4441-1
00:32:36.355 --> 00:32:39.188
to keep it complete,
correct and compliance. You know,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4441-2
00:32:39.188 --> 00:32:40.476
it doesn't sound like it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4442-0
00:32:40.476 --> 00:32:43.998
Blinds within itself,
obviously they would to come to the like

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4442-1
00:32:43.998 --> 00:32:45.116
the writing officer.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4461-0
00:32:49.196 --> 00:32:52.488
This is that responsibility. Lie with you.
No, and it doesn't sound that.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4461-1
00:32:52.488 --> 00:32:53.556
That's maybe it doesn't.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4462-0
00:32:53.716 --> 00:32:55.556
Sit here with the designers process today.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4466-0
00:32:59.056 --> 00:32:59.336
No.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4521-0
00:33:01.056 --> 00:33:03.595
Say the audit is coming and say, well,
actually,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4521-1
00:33:03.595 --> 00:33:05.978
who what's the touchpoints of that write
off?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4481-0
00:33:05.196 --> 00:33:05.396
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4521-2
00:33:05.978 --> 00:33:10.226
And it says well connect also and it's we
just ran that it doesn't it's a it goes

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4521-3
00:33:10.226 --> 00:33:14.371
into territory that you think well should
it then should it have gone if you're

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4521-4
00:33:14.371 --> 00:33:18.516
running and why did you any sample you
know you have to sort of start to answer

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4520-0
00:33:18.416 --> 00:33:18.696
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4521-5
00:33:18.516 --> 00:33:19.656
questions for process.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4537-0
00:33:20.696 --> 00:33:24.034
That you don't particularly own or
doesn't sit within your roles and

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4537-1
00:33:24.034 --> 00:33:26.696
responsibility. Yeah, yeah, that's a good,
good patch.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4553-0
00:33:24.986 --> 00:33:27.226
Yeah, well, if it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4554-0
00:33:27.466 --> 00:33:32.746
Helps the end to end rates management
service design work does include.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4560-0
00:33:35.076 --> 00:33:35.196
We.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4561-0
00:33:35.196 --> 00:33:36.276
Might be able to put a job.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4585-0
00:33:41.156 --> 00:33:42.036
It's an.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4586-0
00:33:43.276 --> 00:33:47.669
Important principle build point of
service designers reducing and obviously

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4586-1
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:52.235
having the right people doing the right
things because every time it passes to

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4586-2
00:33:52.235 --> 00:33:53.276
another team then.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4594-0
00:33:53.196 --> 00:33:55.916
Mm-hmm. You know,
increasing points of failing to. Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4602-0
00:33:54.916 --> 00:33:57.668
Exactly.
So actually it's a benefit to the

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4602-1
00:33:57.668 --> 00:33:58.756
business to have.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4625-0
00:33:59.626 --> 00:34:02.514
Centralization and standardisation as
much as possible,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4625-1
00:34:02.514 --> 00:34:06.125
around 20 teams involved with three teams
could do something. Mm-hmm.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4625-2
00:34:06.125 --> 00:34:07.466
Is a million times better.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4661-0
00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:11.990
If you were, if you were to be,
I think as part of any processes,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4661-1
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:16.043
could you be held responsible for its
data and you think it doesn't lie with us

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4661-2
00:34:16.043 --> 00:34:19.742
anyway? So in that very nature,
it doesn't sound that the process should

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4661-3
00:34:19.742 --> 00:34:21.566
lie with you. And obviously, if you.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4713-0
00:34:20.956 --> 00:34:25.130
Same one as a brand like even from the
government's perspective or brand in

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4713-1
00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:28.316
terms of culture,
we always have rights obvious it should

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4713-2
00:34:28.316 --> 00:34:31.667
be seen as it's a no, no,
you are seen as a bad thing from a

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4713-3
00:34:31.667 --> 00:34:35.293
financial like governance,
but if it's a spreadsheet that's going

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4713-4
00:34:35.293 --> 00:34:38.369
around 2030 or .
20 different teams and everyone's just

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4713-5
00:34:38.369 --> 00:34:40.676
passing it on and acting like it's normal.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4720-0
00:34:41.636 --> 00:34:43.556
It it incorporates or brings of the
payment.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4727-0
00:34:45.596 --> 00:34:47.636
They expect the projects in concluded.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4730-0
00:34:50.276 --> 00:34:51.836
That basically just about there.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4748-0
00:34:52.506 --> 00:34:57.530
And she just wants to know when our team
is in terms of the process and how we're

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4748-1
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:58.266
all done it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4749-0
00:34:58.666 --> 00:34:59.826
So did you teach us to Abby?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4751-0
00:35:03.676 --> 00:35:04.316
OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4757-0
00:35:10.016 --> 00:35:10.536
Design.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4782-0
00:35:11.336 --> 00:35:14.467
No, no, exactly,
but just to park it as you know,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4764-0
00:35:12.836 --> 00:35:12.996
Just.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4782-1
00:35:14.467 --> 00:35:17.662
I think it does is wire disconnecting
handle this.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4782-2
00:35:17.662 --> 00:35:20.856
I think it was the critical notes I would
have on.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4787-0
00:35:19.876 --> 00:35:23.236
Excellent. Oh, no. It's Abigail Lilly.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4790-0
00:35:24.796 --> 00:35:25.236
And she's.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4807-0
00:35:28.916 --> 00:35:32.516
Abigail Lilly and she's a lead internal
audit.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4808-0
00:35:33.836 --> 00:35:36.556
So the factual is an audit.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4819-0
00:35:38.196 --> 00:35:40.676
I think I think we've done a full loop on.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4818-0
00:35:38.406 --> 00:35:42.166
All right.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4832-0
00:35:43.836 --> 00:35:45.276
Is that the name for the parking?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4831-0
00:35:43.896 --> 00:35:47.376
I've moved on. Thank you.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4833-0
00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:46.236
Lot that maybe we over here.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4847-0
00:35:50.536 --> 00:35:54.776
I think that's our. Yeah.
And I suppose maybe just to end on.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4846-0
00:35:52.086 --> 00:35:52.486
Correct.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4870-0
00:35:56.776 --> 00:36:00.461
As I talked to looking at sort of
globalised, you know,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4870-1
00:36:00.461 --> 00:36:04.937
in all our things workshops we've had,
you know billing UK billing,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4870-2
00:36:04.937 --> 00:36:06.056
Australia cashew.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4887-0
00:36:08.176 --> 00:36:11.137
So I suppose you probably think I could
buy. I mentioned it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4887-1
00:36:11.137 --> 00:36:13.856
Now I've got to go home at 5:00.
But what do Australia.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4907-0
00:36:14.836 --> 00:36:18.878
How can they handle it so differently and
they're more looking for?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4907-1
00:36:18.878 --> 00:36:23.099
What do they do for, and if so,
who does it and could they incorporate

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4906-0
00:36:21.886 --> 00:36:22.486
No, no, I.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4907-2
00:36:23.099 --> 00:36:23.396
this?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4909-0
00:36:24.236 --> 00:36:25.236
I understand so.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4925-0
00:36:27.156 --> 00:36:27.876
I think this.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4926-0
00:36:27.876 --> 00:36:29.196
The as I said.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4927-0
00:36:29.196 --> 00:36:32.996
It's trumple you have been here for 10
years.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4937-0
00:36:34.026 --> 00:36:37.346
So when I was first starting,
Trimble wasn't even.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4948-0
00:36:39.416 --> 00:36:43.496
Wasn't even, it was.
That was the only used. Right and then.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4979-0
00:36:44.976 --> 00:36:50.228
At the same time,
Sydney was using a programme called EMX,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4964-0
00:36:49.836 --> 00:36:50.036
Mm-hmm.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4979-1
00:36:50.228 --> 00:36:56.904
which is semi integrated in booking
system and then MRI over trambo and we

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4979-2
00:36:56.904 --> 00:37:00.376
were trying to again this is before my.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4995-0
00:37:01.256 --> 00:37:04.656
We're trying to amplify everyone to use
the same phone booking system UK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4996-0
00:37:04.656 --> 00:37:06.496
And Australia, yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/4993-0
00:37:05.976 --> 00:37:06.456
Yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5007-0
00:37:08.076 --> 00:37:11.356
For unknown reasons I show you not to
back this is.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5009-0
00:37:11.946 --> 00:37:13.306
So they yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5024-0
00:37:14.676 --> 00:37:20.076
Yeah. And that's what we used to do. Yes.
OK, so.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5013-0
00:37:15.496 --> 00:37:16.336
So.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5025-0
00:37:20.596 --> 00:37:21.436
They get.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5060-0
00:37:23.466 --> 00:37:26.744
Because you've got that charge back in
hospitality and catering,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5060-1
00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:29.518
so there is some,
probably that still needs to happen.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5060-2
00:37:29.518 --> 00:37:31.737
So if they look at,
look at their workflow,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5060-3
00:37:31.737 --> 00:37:35.066
they still need to manage the room,
book the room, move the room.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5079-0
00:37:35.156 --> 00:37:40.620
Cancel the car parking all of that.
So I'm just wondering if an opportunity

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5079-1
00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:40.836
of.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5080-0
00:37:40.836 --> 00:37:40.956
If.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5081-0
00:37:41.676 --> 00:37:44.836
They're not going to be globalised if not,
why not exactly?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5085-0
00:37:46.436 --> 00:37:46.476
The.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5092-0
00:37:46.486 --> 00:37:51.046
I'm managing another system on the
ecosystem of architecture is another.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5107-0
00:37:52.616 --> 00:37:57.336
And that if we're looking at integrating
with 3E coming on board so.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5150-0
00:37:59.336 --> 00:37:59.976
It's not just.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5151-0
00:37:59.976 --> 00:38:02.209
Australia,
but you've got new offices I think in

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5151-1
00:38:02.209 --> 00:38:03.576
Marin in somewhere in Morocco.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5152-0
00:38:03.576 --> 00:38:07.411
I think and you have new offices in the
Middle East with the last couple of weeks.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5152-1
00:38:07.411 --> 00:38:08.936
So do you absorb that or are you?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5153-0
00:38:08.936 --> 00:38:12.896
Just sort of the different speed. Just go.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5154-0
00:38:12.896 --> 00:38:14.296
Back to the number.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5158-0
00:38:14.976 --> 00:38:15.256
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5164-0
00:38:15.576 --> 00:38:17.976
So we use a separate form.
It's actually a quite form.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5167-0
00:38:18.686 --> 00:38:19.566
The SharePoint 1.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5185-0
00:38:19.656 --> 00:38:24.056
To book rooms, facilities. Yeah,
certainly uses EMS which is same

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5185-1
00:38:24.056 --> 00:38:27.056
integrated.
So we use our can go into entry.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5200-0
00:38:27.646 --> 00:38:32.126
And look, the rooms that way. So yeah,
it's like a kind of direct.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5201-0
00:38:32.366 --> 00:38:33.126
I can show you we.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5202-0
00:38:33.126 --> 00:38:34.006
Have that. Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5220-0
00:38:33.976 --> 00:38:37.001
Mm-hmm.
There's no reason why they couldn't use

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5220-1
00:38:37.001 --> 00:38:40.594
service. You know,
generally moving forward as a managed

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5220-2
00:38:40.594 --> 00:38:42.296
service through ServiceNow.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5242-0
00:38:41.746 --> 00:38:42.946
No, I don't care. I don't.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5243-0
00:38:42.946 --> 00:38:44.666
See, you're been doing it, see.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5244-0
00:38:44.666 --> 00:38:47.768
It's just right now we're gonna try so
obviously.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5244-1
00:38:47.768 --> 00:38:52.546
But I spoke about activation and the the
leadership team and the head of it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5248-0
00:38:54.376 --> 00:38:55.256
Wants a global solution.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5267-0
00:38:56.296 --> 00:39:01.013
And thank all everybody using safety
systems, which is a total agree on every,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5267-1
00:39:01.013 --> 00:39:04.536
could all use A1 number consistent
because at each office.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5312-0
00:39:06.236 --> 00:39:11.291
And I don't which system everybody uses.
To be fair, I really don't know.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5312-1
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:16.620
But he's looking for a global solution,
and that was the problem is that last

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5312-2
00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.240
legs it came back to see capabilities,
requirements.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5312-3
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:24.476
What do you need and etcetera.
So we've sent all that out to.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5318-0
00:39:25.516 --> 00:39:27.836
Get the leadership to see this is what we
need.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5333-0
00:39:29.036 --> 00:39:33.689
We're told in the reasons why Cadence
does work as a as a room booking

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5333-1
00:39:33.689 --> 00:39:34.476
alternative.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5343-0
00:39:36.156 --> 00:39:39.396
And again, we'll produce that part where,
OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5369-0
00:39:40.176 --> 00:39:44.880
So that's just that's a separate project
at the moment for one room booking,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5369-1
00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.896
whether BSM or Trimble a another.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5370-0
00:39:47.216 --> 00:39:48.776
I don't think the want.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5371-0
00:39:48.776 --> 00:39:50.376
To take on the SM is that as a?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5372-0
00:39:50.376 --> 00:39:53.056
Is. It's been clunky old as well.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5380-0
00:39:54.656 --> 00:39:56.496
MRI it's it's quite old as well, but.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5389-0
00:39:58.536 --> 00:40:00.736
I don't know what they're going to do.
I don't want to search.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5400-0
00:40:00.606 --> 00:40:02.286
Leading that project.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5401-0
00:40:02.806 --> 00:40:07.246
Right now it's Simon Wallace,
which is Red Hand goes along and.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5411-0
00:40:10.606 --> 00:40:13.029
OK.
And that's currently an investigation

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5411-1
00:40:13.029 --> 00:40:14.126
that they're doing?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5428-0
00:40:16.096 --> 00:40:20.205
You've submitted all your requirements,
or at least requests,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5428-1
00:40:20.205 --> 00:40:22.856
and then they'll come back and is there.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5432-0
00:40:24.526 --> 00:40:26.046
Instead the time frame.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5434-0
00:40:24.936 --> 00:40:25.376
Any.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5451-0
00:40:27.096 --> 00:40:32.736
I suggested that we trial it for London
due to already being the contract,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5451-1
00:40:32.736 --> 00:40:36.496
the booking system and just to see where
it goes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5462-0
00:40:40.856 --> 00:40:42.176
Globally, yeah, or are.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5463-0
00:40:42.376 --> 00:40:44.136
We gonna look at another system.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5464-0
00:40:44.656 --> 00:40:44.896
OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5503-0
00:40:47.436 --> 00:40:51.043
OK, we're exactly. I mean,
I'm just thinking that, you know,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5503-1
00:40:51.043 --> 00:40:54.827
maybe not to solution idea,
but maybe Australia has one system,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5503-2
00:40:54.827 --> 00:40:58.611
we have another, there's two plugins.
You know that's possible,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5503-3
00:40:58.611 --> 00:41:02.396
but the actual entry point of booking a
room a managed service.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5526-0
00:41:02.466 --> 00:41:05.754
That's, you know,
and that's probably what we want to get

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5526-1
00:41:05.754 --> 00:41:08.531
to is that everyone,
if you want to book a room,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5526-2
00:41:08.531 --> 00:41:11.026
you still have to request, you know,
maybe.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5565-0
00:41:11.076 --> 00:41:14.800
Self-service maybe not.
Maybe there is an ability that it becomes

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5565-1
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.749
self-service and don't need to,
you know manage it like you do at the

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5565-2
00:41:18.749 --> 00:41:21.796
moment booking it.
But that's certainly something we.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5566-0
00:41:21.796 --> 00:41:22.036
Can.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5567-0
00:41:22.036 --> 00:41:25.630
Look at probably you know,
be good to know that landing of what they

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5567-1
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:27.036
decide on a global booking.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5569-0
00:41:27.816 --> 00:41:28.056
Yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5584-0
00:41:29.236 --> 00:41:31.516
I guess whether we can integrate well
with.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5578-0
00:41:31.136 --> 00:41:31.416
Yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5585-0
00:41:32.196 --> 00:41:35.036
Two. Yeah. Or the A or another.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5593-0
00:41:37.176 --> 00:41:41.736
Fully integrate that influence.
Australians be happy to move.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5602-0
00:41:42.346 --> 00:41:45.369
Two leading towards replaces in Trumbull
as well.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5602-1
00:41:45.369 --> 00:41:47.666
In towards replacing Trumbull as well.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5620-0
00:42:06.506 --> 00:42:11.765
And Simon is the student war
Encourageable to offer a global solution

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5620-1
00:42:11.765 --> 00:42:12.066
and.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5633-0
00:42:13.616 --> 00:42:18.176
Sweet Australia to go into M and I or
even look at.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5649-0
00:42:20.566 --> 00:42:23.769
And it doesn't work for you.
The Australian version doesn't work for

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5649-1
00:42:23.769 --> 00:42:24.326
you because.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5650-0
00:42:24.326 --> 00:42:26.046
We won't have an offer at the EMS.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5664-0
00:42:26.656 --> 00:42:30.736
But if you were, if that was, I mean,
could it work, you know?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5671-0
00:42:31.236 --> 00:42:35.316
System is outdated anyway, so the next.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5687-0
00:42:34.956 --> 00:42:37.457
Right,
so to the advantages you've you've got

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5687-1
00:42:37.457 --> 00:42:40.556
used to in Trimble don't don't exist
maybe in EMS maybe?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5690-0
00:42:43.316 --> 00:42:44.916
Yeah. So.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5698-0
00:42:45.466 --> 00:42:48.586
You think there's a managed service?
There's only so much.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5738-0
00:43:08.026 --> 00:43:11.906
That old staff put on rooms here and.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5739-0
00:43:11.906 --> 00:43:12.706
Find that they.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5740-0
00:43:12.906 --> 00:43:17.514
Would send through a team's link to the
four floor rooms,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5740-1
00:43:17.514 --> 00:43:22.123
but they found that the system still
speak to each other,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5740-2
00:43:22.123 --> 00:43:24.666
so if they said the link to 412.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5745-0
00:43:25.516 --> 00:43:27.956
It's actually booked by someone else
because Outlook.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5757-0
00:43:30.006 --> 00:43:30.366
Yeah, the.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5758-0
00:43:30.606 --> 00:43:31.446
Number can speak.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5759-0
00:43:31.446 --> 00:43:34.646
To each other.
So if I take them back where is processed.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5794-0
00:43:36.976 --> 00:43:40.064
Where there's a lot of quality in human
input,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5794-1
00:43:40.064 --> 00:43:45.385
and this is where this leads to can we do
the testing for London before what the

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5794-2
00:43:45.385 --> 00:43:49.656
the service there was,
it's in the contract. Can we test it out?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5797-0
00:43:51.176 --> 00:43:52.056
Is this 100%?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5811-0
00:43:54.296 --> 00:43:55.136
1800 lbs.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5812-0
00:43:55.536 --> 00:43:55.976
Say it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5814-0
00:43:56.536 --> 00:44:00.576
To say that up for London,
it is already in confidence.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5817-0
00:43:58.746 --> 00:44:02.426
Because it's not, yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5829-0
00:44:04.336 --> 00:44:07.051
Well,
if it'll be good to know when that lands

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5829-1
00:44:07.051 --> 00:44:07.456
as the.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5867-0
00:44:08.156 --> 00:44:12.348
Yes, exactly same.
But no thank you for that differentiation

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5867-1
00:44:12.348 --> 00:44:13.036
of what's.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5868-0
00:44:14.076 --> 00:44:19.836
So essentially EMS same integrated MRI is
not, yeah, OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5857-0
00:44:20.036 --> 00:44:20.396
That's.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5869-0
00:44:20.036 --> 00:44:20.836
That it could be.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5870-0
00:44:21.316 --> 00:44:25.516
And so do Australia pick up queries then
on the back of.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5865-0
00:44:22.376 --> 00:44:22.496
The.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5919-0
00:44:26.396 --> 00:44:29.116
Room bookings that need they don't pick
up anything, so.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5920-0
00:44:29.636 --> 00:44:34.586
We the only time that we are in contact
really with Australia is for the website

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5920-1
00:44:34.586 --> 00:44:38.192
enquiries. Yes,
I think that's why that's the booking. Oh,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5920-2
00:44:38.192 --> 00:44:39.476
I think there is one.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5921-0
00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:42.786
There is one very top it reminds me.
So the interview bookings,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5921-1
00:44:42.786 --> 00:44:46.356
but the manager in the same way I want to
book a room for yeah, she.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5929-0
00:44:46.906 --> 00:44:47.906
Spaceship again on.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5930-0
00:44:47.906 --> 00:44:48.466
The 4th of.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5942-0
00:44:48.236 --> 00:44:49.676
Website inquiries, yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5931-0
00:44:48.466 --> 00:44:48.626
July.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5943-0
00:44:50.236 --> 00:44:53.356
Website inquiries is where I user would
go into.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5952-0
00:44:55.656 --> 00:44:58.936
And enquiry inquiry and then we would
extend.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5982-0
00:44:57.826 --> 00:45:01.146
External external Azure's website, yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5983-0
00:45:01.466 --> 00:45:04.546
We'll go. And what are they asking? Sorry.
What they or.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5984-0
00:45:04.546 --> 00:45:07.921
When you order ashraf.com,
it's just an enquiry page.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5984-1
00:45:07.921 --> 00:45:09.546
I think it's like contact.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5991-0
00:45:09.146 --> 00:45:13.866
Oh, no. I was gonna say 1 is a test.
I'm just going to see you Monday.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/5997-0
00:45:16.496 --> 00:45:19.056
Yeah, OK. Yes, yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6011-0
00:45:17.316 --> 00:45:21.796
They categorised the.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6012-0
00:45:22.196 --> 00:45:26.716
Are kind of sort of a large FEQ on them.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6022-0
00:45:28.076 --> 00:45:31.636
Sometimes we don't spam more,
so we'll support.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6047-0
00:45:31.756 --> 00:45:35.468
The investigation and some some of them,
are Forest, Julia,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6029-0
00:45:33.876 --> 00:45:34.196
OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6047-1
00:45:35.468 --> 00:45:39.798
actually quite a lot of Australia.
So we just put them through to the

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6047-2
00:45:39.798 --> 00:45:41.716
Australian reception teams, OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6049-0
00:45:42.616 --> 00:45:44.376
And letting redirect OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6053-0
00:45:45.496 --> 00:45:46.296
Let's make this helpful.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6069-0
00:45:48.236 --> 00:45:55.036
So it comes in like a there's a form back
ends comes into your inbox today, yes.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6072-0
00:45:57.176 --> 00:45:57.456
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6074-0
00:45:59.156 --> 00:45:59.636
OK. Thank you.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6076-0
00:46:02.266 --> 00:46:03.106
OK, that's good.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6089-0
00:46:05.956 --> 00:46:06.396
Thank you I.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6090-0
00:46:06.396 --> 00:46:09.836
Think we captured the notes science and
managing the.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6098-0
00:46:11.686 --> 00:46:13.674
Thank you.
We'll go away and then we'll keep

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6098-1
00:46:13.674 --> 00:46:14.646
managing that service.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6135-0
00:46:16.216 --> 00:46:21.032
Providing but as I said that we've we've
populated on the shared area checklists,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6135-1
00:46:21.032 --> 00:46:24.733
all that information,
but it sounds like we're capturing a lot

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6135-2
00:46:24.733 --> 00:46:29.256
up front that can save a lot of your
queries downstream to aid that process.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6139-0
00:46:31.856 --> 00:46:32.296
That's good.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6156-0
00:46:32.336 --> 00:46:36.502
OK. We'll let you go in a SEC.
Just to wrap up things and for

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6156-1
00:46:36.502 --> 00:46:40.669
information things.
Some reports and dashboards you suggested

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6156-2
00:46:40.669 --> 00:46:42.416
one earlier. That's great.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6171-0
00:46:43.936 --> 00:46:46.534
You've got some ideas.
Please do send them,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6171-1
00:46:46.534 --> 00:46:48.896
send them across some other things that.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6174-0
00:46:47.156 --> 00:46:47.356
1.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6175-0
00:46:48.916 --> 00:46:50.236
The team share page.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6215-0
00:46:50.916 --> 00:46:53.955
I mean things like these rooms in the
next 24 hours,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6215-1
00:46:53.955 --> 00:46:57.912
these rooms in the next 48 hours,
you know, they could be, you know,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6215-2
00:46:57.912 --> 00:47:02.327
non approval or haven't heard back you
know for that you know as I said that

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6215-3
00:47:02.327 --> 00:47:06.628
maybe some of the catering but it just
gives you a lead time give you some

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6215-4
00:47:06.628 --> 00:47:07.316
information.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6251-0
00:47:08.056 --> 00:47:15.675
The 40 hour check would save a manual
emails, yes, streamline that process,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6221-0
00:47:08.256 --> 00:47:08.376
On.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6251-1
00:47:15.675 --> 00:47:16.176
sure.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6252-0
00:47:16.776 --> 00:47:21.495
I mean, they actually may be sorry.
Just one thing to talk about is that if

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6252-1
00:47:21.495 --> 00:47:25.096
these queries are coming to a group,
as you know connect.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6255-0
00:47:25.326 --> 00:47:25.526
Mm-hmm.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6298-0
00:47:25.876 --> 00:47:28.542
Ask Connect,
but it could be based on your skill

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6298-1
00:47:28.542 --> 00:47:32.513
matrix. It may be you deal with London.
You deal with Glasgow, you know.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6298-2
00:47:32.513 --> 00:47:35.451
For example,
you could have a skills matrix that auto

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6298-3
00:47:35.451 --> 00:47:38.226
assigns.
It's not set in stone that if I only deal

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6298-4
00:47:38.226 --> 00:47:41.000
with one,
but it could be that you could have some

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6298-5
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.796
auto assignment in there as well.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6325-0
00:47:43.346 --> 00:47:47.627
So that maybe I always deal with training.
I always deal with client. I don't deal,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6325-1
00:47:47.627 --> 00:47:50.226
you know,
but it's just a mechanism that can have.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6318-0
00:47:47.756 --> 00:47:47.916
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6383-0
00:47:51.746 --> 00:47:54.632
Delegation initially, which we assigned,
it's not set,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6330-0
00:47:52.916 --> 00:47:52.956
A.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6383-1
00:47:54.632 --> 00:47:57.938
you get to see everybody's you get to see
the whole portfolio,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6383-2
00:47:57.938 --> 00:48:02.241
but it could be these were like house for
the day that could be on the dashboard.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6383-3
00:48:02.241 --> 00:48:06.439
So I know that I'm going to be doing X
amount of room looking for these clients

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6383-4
00:48:06.439 --> 00:48:10.322
or I always do the VIP clients.
So if you've got anything that looks like

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6383-5
00:48:10.322 --> 00:48:12.106
a skills matrix, it can certainly.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6420-0
00:48:13.406 --> 00:48:17.685
But as a group you can see everything.
That's probably how you want it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6420-1
00:48:17.685 --> 00:48:20.538
There's no,
it doesn't sound like you need live

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6420-2
00:48:20.538 --> 00:48:24.995
cheques. You're not checking each other.
There's no approvals in there for

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6420-3
00:48:24.995 --> 00:48:28.086
yourself internally as a team or manager
approvals.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6464-0
00:48:28.976 --> 00:48:31.467
But it's just how you might like to
segregate some work.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6464-1
00:48:31.467 --> 00:48:33.696
I don't know if you have a skills matrix
in place.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6465-0
00:48:34.616 --> 00:48:35.816
I've got idea.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6466-0
00:48:35.976 --> 00:48:39.112
Actually,
have a look at actually mostly I think

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6466-1
00:48:39.112 --> 00:48:40.136
that's just one.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6467-0
00:48:40.136 --> 00:48:43.523
I'm thinking of how it can be assigned to
this meeting room.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6459-0
00:48:42.076 --> 00:48:42.396
Oh yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6467-1
00:48:43.523 --> 00:48:44.856
Always gets to yourself.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6476-0
00:48:45.646 --> 00:48:48.726
And I manage that or you know,
it could be just auto assign.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6485-0
00:48:48.466 --> 00:48:48.826
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6486-0
00:48:49.706 --> 00:48:50.466
We can incorporate.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6478-0
00:48:50.376 --> 00:48:50.536
That.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6487-0
00:48:50.626 --> 00:48:51.426
Into the machine.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6528-0
00:48:51.356 --> 00:48:54.324
Yeah,
it's more or less can work on anything.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6528-1
00:48:54.324 --> 00:48:57.356
It makes it easier when it comes to auto
sign.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6507-0
00:48:56.116 --> 00:48:58.156
Yeah, if you want.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6529-0
00:48:57.356 --> 00:49:01.442
On it. But if you want to do it,
maybe that's capacity based then that you

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6529-1
00:49:01.442 --> 00:49:05.365
know that actually I'm working on 20 who
also assigned to someone else.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6529-2
00:49:05.365 --> 00:49:06.836
So we can look at it first.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6570-0
00:49:07.896 --> 00:49:11.406
At a client level,
but you might want to just have a group

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6570-1
00:49:11.406 --> 00:49:16.165
decision that I'll handle these or or it
could be these are just come in the Q,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6570-2
00:49:16.165 --> 00:49:19.079
we handle them 1 by 1.
You know as they come in,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6570-3
00:49:19.079 --> 00:49:23.957
you know it's on a you just pick them up.
But at the beginning of the day there's

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6570-4
00:49:23.957 --> 00:49:24.136
20.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6582-0
00:49:24.686 --> 00:49:27.479
Say I'll take the first five,
you'll the next 5? I'll pick 17.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6582-1
00:49:27.479 --> 00:49:28.366
I should have asked.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6602-0
00:49:30.156 --> 00:49:34.718
Yes,
but they were somewhere 7 till 12 and

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6602-1
00:49:34.718 --> 00:49:40.236
then to go to work all the people apart
from it so.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6621-0
00:49:41.246 --> 00:49:47.246
So 77 AM to 9 PMI need to Thursday.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6614-0
00:49:42.676 --> 00:49:44.676
What's the shift over 24 hours?
Or do you want?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6645-0
00:49:48.476 --> 00:49:52.667
Is the shift the so for example your
hours would be.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6645-1
00:49:52.667 --> 00:49:58.836
So connect is open 7:00 AM to 9:00 PM on
Thursday. Do you know what's Friday?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6648-0
00:49:59.316 --> 00:50:00.516
I have sex with my baby.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6661-0
00:50:00.656 --> 00:50:03.349
06/30 OK.
And then anything outside of that

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6661-1
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:05.736
security and on the same day reception?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6662-0
00:50:06.686 --> 00:50:08.006
I have an essential.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6698-0
00:50:09.556 --> 00:50:13.898
After 9:00 PM Monday,
suppose we will pick up. OK,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6698-1
00:50:13.898 --> 00:50:15.516
so it just it just.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6699-0
00:50:15.756 --> 00:50:18.170
OK.
Because I I mean this might be of

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6699-1
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:21.664
interest or not,
but I did field service management in

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6699-2
00:50:21.664 --> 00:50:24.713
Africa,
so it could be and they were shift work

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6699-3
00:50:24.713 --> 00:50:25.476
essentially.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6726-0
00:50:26.476 --> 00:50:29.898
Whatever wasn't completed or still need
to be worked on or whatever,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6726-1
00:50:29.898 --> 00:50:32.725
even though it was assigned to you up
until say 9:00 PM,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6726-2
00:50:32.725 --> 00:50:36.396
you could take all your tasks and all to
assign them to whoever comes up.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6778-0
00:50:37.436 --> 00:50:40.845
Can you do that for you?
You know all to assign to the next person,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6778-1
00:50:40.845 --> 00:50:44.456
so it's in their queue, is it?
That's available in service now that you

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6778-2
00:50:44.456 --> 00:50:48.517
can get this handing over of shipmark
pattern if that, if that's what we'd like.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6778-3
00:50:48.517 --> 00:50:52.479
So that could be incorporated in the
matrix that whoever's on gets these tasks

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6778-4
00:50:52.479 --> 00:50:55.036
and they could be auto assigned after a
such time.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6781-0
00:50:55.726 --> 00:50:56.566
7:00 AM.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6819-0
00:50:58.136 --> 00:51:04.487
Start with do the 4:00 AM cheques. Yes.
And then the weekly report would be past

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6819-1
00:51:04.487 --> 00:51:06.056
the yeah late shift.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6820-0
00:51:06.056 --> 00:51:07.016
So you can pick that up as.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6821-0
00:51:07.016 --> 00:51:11.458
Part of the process. Yeah.
And anything outside goes to,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6821-1
00:51:11.458 --> 00:51:16.056
presumably the security.
If they don't do the cheques, OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6842-0
00:51:17.176 --> 00:51:18.936
So some tasks excluded from them,
they just.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6836-0
00:51:18.716 --> 00:51:20.916
Yeah. Book that's up.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6843-0
00:51:19.536 --> 00:51:20.536
Seeking pods.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6845-0
00:51:21.336 --> 00:51:24.656
OK, when we're not there. Yeah,
and it's OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6876-0
00:51:23.316 --> 00:51:27.617
OK, OK, OK.
But anything outside of that 9:00 PM to

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6876-1
00:51:27.617 --> 00:51:31.836
7:00 AM, there's no room booking. No. OK,
no good.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6865-0
00:51:32.476 --> 00:51:32.876
OK so.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6877-0
00:51:32.836 --> 00:51:36.902
We can incorporate that assignment groups
and shift patterns into the matrix as

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6877-1
00:51:36.902 --> 00:51:37.156
well.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6888-0
00:51:38.776 --> 00:51:41.936
These are just sessions.
If he didn't have anything in mind but.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6899-0
00:51:46.186 --> 00:51:50.446
Knowledge you spoke about earlier again
sounds like you're 2 steps on that one as

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6899-1
00:51:50.446 --> 00:51:50.706
well.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6918-0
00:51:52.596 --> 00:51:53.876
We. So do you have any of those in?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6919-0
00:51:53.876 --> 00:51:58.236
Place before. Now, no.
We've always had internally for me.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6920-0
00:51:58.276 --> 00:51:59.436
Like the FUQ.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6926-0
00:52:01.966 --> 00:52:04.046
No, I'll be alright.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6927-0
00:52:03.316 --> 00:52:03.916
All right.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6933-0
00:52:06.956 --> 00:52:08.956
Yeah, that's. I was thinking about more.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6936-0
00:52:10.996 --> 00:52:11.636
I think so.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6963-0
00:52:13.356 --> 00:52:15.941
Particularly,
I mean between now and go live with

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6963-1
00:52:15.941 --> 00:52:19.716
service and some of the things that maybe
you can incorporate, you know,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6963-2
00:52:19.716 --> 00:52:22.560
pushing back,
pushing back these articles back on them

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6963-3
00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:23.956
to say, well, this is what?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6976-0
00:52:25.176 --> 00:52:28.976
It's completely up to get people more
self-sufficient in London.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6964-0
00:52:25.356 --> 00:52:25.716
You know.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6979-0
00:52:32.656 --> 00:52:33.696
Partner of the week.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6981-0
00:52:37.726 --> 00:52:38.446
Surprise.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/6985-0
00:52:40.536 --> 00:52:41.296
Someone's got to win it.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7036-0
00:52:43.706 --> 00:52:47.735
This is what we're going to be doing next
and you guys have visibility of this.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7036-1
00:52:47.735 --> 00:52:51.814
So you'll see what we're we're designing.
So it could actually things we have to

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7036-2
00:52:51.814 --> 00:52:53.426
see and sign off or planning on.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7017-0
00:52:53.536 --> 00:52:53.936
Signing.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7037-0
00:52:54.106 --> 00:52:57.266
And maybe like this one,
when we talked about user stories of what

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7037-1
00:52:57.266 --> 00:52:59.106
that meant, maybe that's fallen out of.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7038-0
00:52:59.106 --> 00:52:59.386
It.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7039-0
00:52:59.746 --> 00:53:02.466
Easier to visualise that I want to.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7040-0
00:53:02.466 --> 00:53:03.786
Do the following and they just form.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7045-0
00:53:05.076 --> 00:53:06.396
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7069-0
00:53:07.856 --> 00:53:12.448
Next key dates,
so we'll be publishing this next week,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7069-1
00:53:12.448 --> 00:53:14.536
I think, yeah, next week.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7070-0
00:53:15.896 --> 00:53:21.816
We'll start them as a as a yeah,
sort of connect. We've got like a week.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7081-0
00:53:22.656 --> 00:53:25.496
After workshops starting kind of out for
the actions from this.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7126-0
00:53:26.726 --> 00:53:31.526
But also user story drafting as an end to
end solution I think.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7127-0
00:53:31.526 --> 00:53:31.766
You've.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7128-0
00:53:31.766 --> 00:53:36.488
Got each of your tasks and then take it
up a level of actually that workflow.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7128-1
00:53:36.488 --> 00:53:39.575
We started it when you joined all that
onboarding.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7128-2
00:53:39.575 --> 00:53:42.299
So we can start to incorporate as a
finance,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7128-3
00:53:42.299 --> 00:53:45.326
but we incorporated back into the whole
offering.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7130-0
00:53:46.156 --> 00:53:46.556
Service now.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7167-0
00:53:48.446 --> 00:53:52.414
Yep. And then we got ad hoc sessions.
I don't think we necessarily need need

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7167-1
00:53:52.414 --> 00:53:54.785
any.
There's that one project that's going on

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7167-2
00:53:54.785 --> 00:53:57.619
with that process.
Something comes out of it that's in

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7167-3
00:53:57.619 --> 00:54:01.433
ourscope. Then I need to come back to it.
But it depends where. OK, yeah,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7167-4
00:54:01.433 --> 00:54:02.206
that falls out.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7168-0
00:54:01.806 --> 00:54:02.246
3.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7171-0
00:54:01.857 --> 00:54:04.430
<v Mark Sedge>Josh, there's there's,
there's probably a plate.</v>

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7171-1
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:08.580
<v Mark Sedge>There's probably a bit of a playback one
potentially when we get together with</v>

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7171-2
00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:12.046
<v Mark Sedge>Hannah and work out, you know,
join us movers leave us, you know,</v>

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7171-3
00:54:12.046 --> 00:54:15.933
<v Mark Sedge>how does that actually dovetail in?
So there's probably just one playback</v>

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7170-0
00:54:14.156 --> 00:54:14.436
Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7171-4
00:54:15.933 --> 00:54:18.297
<v Mark Sedge>that we might need to do just to check
it's.</v>

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7172-0
00:54:18.617 --> 00:54:19.257
<v Mark Sedge>Aligned.</v>

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7214-0
00:54:20.306 --> 00:54:23.211
Yes, good point.
And then the key dates might be

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7214-1
00:54:23.211 --> 00:54:26.353
interesting.
So the grey ones are more kind of us on

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7214-2
00:54:26.353 --> 00:54:29.435
the technical side,
but the blue ones will be when,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7214-3
00:54:29.435 --> 00:54:33.407
so the end of testing at least.
So a test can be a bit before that

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7214-4
00:54:33.407 --> 00:54:35.186
training will be a little bit.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7215-0
00:54:35.186 --> 00:54:35.986
Before that day.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7227-0
00:54:36.816 --> 00:54:37.216
1st for go.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7228-0
00:54:37.216 --> 00:54:37.376
Live.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7229-0
00:54:37.656 --> 00:54:40.576
And that's the go live plan date and
obviously uses.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7240-0
00:54:42.536 --> 00:54:44.921
But yeah,
some dates dates for the calendar around

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7240-1
00:54:44.921 --> 00:54:45.856
testing and traffic.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7253-0
00:54:52.666 --> 00:54:52.986
Sorry.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7297-0
00:54:52.916 --> 00:54:57.035
Can I just say one thing just before that
the previous slide is that you know we've

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7297-1
00:54:57.035 --> 00:55:01.106
got an opportunity now like you know when
we implementations have system readiness

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7297-2
00:55:01.106 --> 00:55:03.999
training where this testing readiness,
security readiness,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7297-3
00:55:03.999 --> 00:55:07.874
there's lots of people reading or data
readiness and people readiness is a key

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7297-4
00:55:07.874 --> 00:55:10.228
factor.
And we've got an opportunity for you to

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7297-5
00:55:10.228 --> 00:55:11.356
now and that readiness.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7315-0
00:55:12.276 --> 00:55:14.912
To embed some of the things that we
talked about today.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7315-1
00:55:14.912 --> 00:55:17.596
So maybe with the you know,
we could say we're actually.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7361-0
00:55:18.096 --> 00:55:21.781
Could you populate this? You know,
send some embedded behaviour that you're

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7361-1
00:55:21.781 --> 00:55:24.205
probably?
I know that you're doing that on a data

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7361-2
00:55:24.205 --> 00:55:26.484
set this, but now you can sort of think,
well,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7361-3
00:55:26.484 --> 00:55:30.363
maybe I can send it back to enforce or
maybe there's a notice to say, you know,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7361-4
00:55:30.363 --> 00:55:32.739
room booking,
need your help and can be popular,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7361-5
00:55:32.739 --> 00:55:33.176
you know.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7390-0
00:55:34.276 --> 00:55:37.065
Bring it to life.
You don't have to wait till we go live to

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7390-1
00:55:37.065 --> 00:55:40.458
start modelling that behaviour.
And then the system starts to pick it up

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7390-2
00:55:40.458 --> 00:55:42.969
and they get used to.
That's what's expected of them.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7390-3
00:55:42.969 --> 00:55:44.596
That's something maybe to consider.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7397-0
00:55:46.716 --> 00:55:49.516
Starting the exchange, a very,
very small step.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7457-0
00:55:49.866 --> 00:55:52.114
I mean,
people are just as I mean they are the

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7457-1
00:55:52.114 --> 00:55:54.746
successful application and all tools
don't mean these.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7458-0
00:55:54.746 --> 00:55:57.446
Are the point of being and yeah,
and some of the things we've said like

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7458-1
00:55:57.446 --> 00:55:58.946
you would post go like like it's really.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7459-0
00:55:58.946 --> 00:56:03.237
Hard to back in a partnership model,
So what we do is we'll say we'll give you

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7459-1
00:56:03.237 --> 00:56:07.202
dual. We'll do dual writing for a bit,
but we'll give you poorest that a

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7459-2
00:56:07.202 --> 00:56:08.506
slightly poorer surface.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7488-0
00:56:09.316 --> 00:56:12.549
If you want like handhold day.
So if they were to e-mail you say hey,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7488-1
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:15.366
I want a room booking.
You'll put the room but you'll say it

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7488-2
00:56:15.366 --> 00:56:17.998
takes, you know,
have an auto line of e-mail and say but

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7488-3
00:56:17.998 --> 00:56:19.476
it's going to take you 24 hours.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7526-0
00:56:19.986 --> 00:56:22.909
So if you want to do, here is a link.
So then it's like,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7526-1
00:56:22.909 --> 00:56:26.756
oh actually I can fill it in provided the
form is easy to fill in and it's

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7526-2
00:56:26.756 --> 00:56:30.756
intuitive and they can do it themselves
in 5 minutes is very different. Yeah.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7526-3
00:56:30.756 --> 00:56:32.346
The two in front of the emails.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7576-0
00:56:35.676 --> 00:56:36.396
But from a change.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7577-0
00:56:36.396 --> 00:56:39.156
Perspective.
I don't know if you want me to read out

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7577-1
00:56:39.156 --> 00:56:43.063
some of the impacts I've gathered or if
you want me to tell you next time.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7577-2
00:56:43.063 --> 00:56:45.771
So I think I've just condensed them to
five points.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7577-3
00:56:45.771 --> 00:56:49.730
I think the first one is that we're
shifting to a centralised and trying to

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7577-4
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:50.876
use automation is not.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7590-0
00:56:51.636 --> 00:56:54.516
And by having a system driven approach
from roommate things for instance.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7612-0
00:56:56.116 --> 00:57:00.316
Is able to see like what's vacant,
what's normal, like the aeroplane.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7612-1
00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:04.336
You're saying there seems to be a push
for enhanced governance and

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7612-2
00:57:04.336 --> 00:57:05.236
accountability.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7658-0
00:57:05.586 --> 00:57:10.664
Because we'll have the datas tell us and
that will allow better operation with

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7658-1
00:57:10.664 --> 00:57:13.171
site.
So you're not being like wasting

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7658-2
00:57:13.171 --> 00:57:16.450
hospitality.
There's also a cultural shift towards

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7658-3
00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:20.050
responsible usage of resources,
not just room bookings,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7658-4
00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:24.100
but things as a whole.
I think seeing everything that's set as

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7658-5
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:25.386
the language market.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7688-0
00:57:25.996 --> 00:57:30.468
And then I think probably the one that
you'll maybe the happiest about is

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7688-1
00:57:30.468 --> 00:57:33.309
redefining roles and streamlining
escalations,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7688-2
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:36.996
having a consistent way for for all the
processes you spoke.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7708-0
00:57:38.416 --> 00:57:43.620
And there's other things that have
dovetailed into other areas like Simon

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7708-1
00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:47.136
Space service design and process for
engineering.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7721-0
00:57:48.636 --> 00:57:51.256
If there's a step at looking at
integrations with other teams like

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7721-1
00:57:51.256 --> 00:57:52.156
finance and ask people.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7756-0
00:57:53.796 --> 00:57:54.156
And then in.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7757-0
00:57:54.156 --> 00:57:56.436
General or the root causes or the root
the?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7758-0
00:57:56.756 --> 00:58:01.151
Ambition that we're trying to get to is
to stop you guys being in the middle of

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7758-1
00:58:01.151 --> 00:58:05.656
things that you don't necessarily have to.
Those are the key events from a change

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7758-2
00:58:05.656 --> 00:58:06.316
perspective.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7777-0
00:58:07.256 --> 00:58:10.894
So I got it,
but there's a much more detailed report.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7777-1
00:58:10.894 --> 00:58:13.656
This was just getting that lunch fatigue.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7786-0
00:58:17.296 --> 00:58:17.456
None.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7820-0
00:58:17.996 --> 00:58:20.632
From that, but on a serious note,
after we've like,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7820-1
00:58:20.632 --> 00:58:23.776
thank you so much for your time,
it's been really insightful.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7820-2
00:58:23.776 --> 00:58:27.376
It's really good to also understand
sentiment and some of the cultural

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7820-3
00:58:27.376 --> 00:58:30.063
challenges like the partners,
behaviours and things.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7820-4
00:58:30.063 --> 00:58:33.156
So what we'll do is we're going to write
this into a report.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7833-0
00:58:34.076 --> 00:58:37.151
Current state for you to state are
proposing toventions.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7833-1
00:58:37.151 --> 00:58:38.716
We will verify them with you.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7871-0
00:58:39.226 --> 00:58:43.779
Next week, but because we're in Glasgow,
I'm gonna try and push to get it done by

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7871-1
00:58:43.779 --> 00:58:46.389
Thursday.
So if you want a face to face review

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7871-2
00:58:46.389 --> 00:58:49.666
rather than another person might e-mail
me something back.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7872-0
00:58:50.666 --> 00:58:55.106
Can I? I'm just sorry. Can I ask 1?
You just came to my mind then.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7898-0
00:58:55.916 --> 00:58:59.024
That these are Roomba.
Do you mind me asking one scenario that

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7898-1
00:58:59.024 --> 00:59:02.921
so these all the room bookings that are
coming to you but is there ever a case

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7898-2
00:59:02.921 --> 00:59:04.796
where there are days where you've got?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7923-0
00:59:06.556 --> 00:59:10.584
Whether you know like not to come in,
power out in the building so you have to

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7923-1
00:59:10.584 --> 00:59:12.929
cancel everybody's meetings at short,
I mean,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7923-2
00:59:12.929 --> 00:59:15.836
does that happen where you have to
reallocate everybody?

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7960-0
00:59:16.506 --> 00:59:19.864
No, OK, I've just thought, you know,
if you come in that you've got to be

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7960-1
00:59:19.864 --> 00:59:22.496
proactive, like, give them enough,
everyone's travelling.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7960-2
00:59:22.496 --> 00:59:25.854
But we found this other place for you to
go. But that doesn't happen. No,

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7960-3
00:59:25.854 --> 00:59:28.986
I just thought it was worthy of another
overlay of the scenario. OK.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7973-0
00:59:28.026 --> 00:59:28.146
All.

abec9ff8-f1e1-46f1-8221-8ff92c2fde54/7974-0
00:59:31.626 --> 00:59:32.226
Right, that is all.
