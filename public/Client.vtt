00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:03.922
<v Josh Sparkes>I can hear you now.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/7-0
00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:04.082
<v Parik Narain>OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/9-0
00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:05.882
<v Parik Narain>Right.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/10-0
00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:10.169
<v Mark Sedge>Well,
you did the honest with the camera as</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/11-0
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.642
<v Josh Sparkes>What is that 1?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/10-1
00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:11.482
<v Mark Sedge>well. Josh, do you mind?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/13-0
00:00:15.442 --> 00:00:19.116
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Should we?
So I think the next part of the workflow</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/13-1
00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:23.314
<v Josh Sparkes>is that correct briefing for Director
interview, is that right?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/13-2
00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.282
<v Josh Sparkes>So after submission completes.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/14-0
00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.402
<v Mark Sedge>Thank, awesome. Thank you.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/15-0
00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:28.682
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So, OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/16-0
00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:40.798
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got to the briefing document to
believe, I mean, is that correct?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/16-1
00:00:40.798 --> 00:00:44.741
<v Josh Sparkes>But after that work, though,
we've got briefing for director of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/16-2
00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:47.882
<v Josh Sparkes>interview,
is that the next stage of the workflow?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/17-0
00:00:49.642 --> 00:00:51.962
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. If you, yes.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/18-0
00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:58.957
<v Josh Sparkes>So what happens there?
So it's it's been submitted,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/18-1
00:00:58.957 --> 00:01:06.392
<v Josh Sparkes>confirmed and then this is the next stage
of the workflow. Is that correct? Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/18-2
00:01:06.392 --> 00:01:11.922
<v Josh Sparkes>So basically we submitted the uploaded
submissions and then.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/19-0
00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:18.642
<v Josh Sparkes>It's up to the the directories organisers
to approach to us on.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/19-1
00:01:18.642 --> 00:01:26.227
<v Josh Sparkes>Usually send an e-mail to the CMG or the
sometimes the partners to arrange for an</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/19-2
00:01:26.227 --> 00:01:29.002
<v Josh Sparkes>interview. So it's not always.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/20-0
00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:35.155
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't always get the get the
invitation on having an interview.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/20-1
00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:38.836
<v Josh Sparkes>These are external.
These are external external.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/20-2
00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Josh Sparkes>From the research researchers from the
directory service provider and with our</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/20-3
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.376
<v Josh Sparkes>partners.
So it's not always that we can get an</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/20-4
00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:49.202
<v Josh Sparkes>invitation.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/21-0
00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:53.350
<v Josh Sparkes>For interview, OK.
And how do you get informed today by</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/21-1
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.733
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail?
The researcher will send an e-mail to to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/21-2
00:01:56.733 --> 00:02:00.324
<v Josh Sparkes>the partners,
to the CMC content because we put all</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/21-3
00:02:00.324 --> 00:02:04.122
<v Josh Sparkes>these contact information on the
submission documents.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/22-0
00:02:04.682 --> 00:02:11.326
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes they will put out in CC then
and that's why we have a record of the of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/22-1
00:02:11.326 --> 00:02:17.068
<v Josh Sparkes>the interview invitation. OK,
but in order to land on for you to have</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/22-2
00:02:17.068 --> 00:02:21.416
<v Josh Sparkes>hindsight,
that someone raises the request that ends</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/22-3
00:02:21.416 --> 00:02:24.122
<v Josh Sparkes>up in chairwell. Is that correct?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/23-0
00:02:24.402 --> 00:02:30.134
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So you get to know about, yes,
sometimes when we also receive a copy of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/23-1
00:02:30.134 --> 00:02:35.058
<v Josh Sparkes>that interview invitations,
we will approach CMG and say we've got</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/23-2
00:02:35.058 --> 00:02:38.732
<v Josh Sparkes>this invitation interview invitation.
If you are,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/23-3
00:02:38.732 --> 00:02:43.802
<v Josh Sparkes>if you like us to provide a draught,
you interview document, please.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/24-0
00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:48.473
<v Josh Sparkes>In the work request or that is known,
sometimes we are not put in CC,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/24-1
00:02:48.473 --> 00:02:53.775
<v Josh Sparkes>so we don't know that that interview has
been arranged and at that point sometimes</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/24-2
00:02:53.775 --> 00:02:57.224
<v Josh Sparkes>the CMG will approach us and submit the
work request.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/24-3
00:02:57.224 --> 00:03:00.928
<v Josh Sparkes>Say we have again an interview from with
the researchers.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/24-4
00:03:00.928 --> 00:03:03.802
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you prepare the interview breathing
Doc?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/25-0
00:03:04.442 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Josh Sparkes>Does it tend to be that you're informed
with CMG or the partners with that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/25-1
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.191
<v Josh Sparkes>interview request has been made is that
I'm just trying to sort of work out the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/25-2
00:03:14.191 --> 00:03:17.902
<v Josh Sparkes>number. I know there's two entries,
but it basically goes,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/25-3
00:03:17.902 --> 00:03:23.122
<v Josh Sparkes>you might get informed and then you ask
if that CMG, that if they want to do this.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/26-0
00:03:23.722 --> 00:03:28.546
<v Josh Sparkes>Complaint but or it comes through,
share will and then it lands as a request</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/26-1
00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:33.244
<v Josh Sparkes>for yourself. Yeah, and it depends.
It depends solely on the researcher as</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/26-2
00:03:33.244 --> 00:03:37.692
<v Josh Sparkes>well and how they like to work.
If we're looking at modelling standard</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/26-3
00:03:37.692 --> 00:03:41.137
<v Josh Sparkes>practise of work,
they can raise a request in service.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/26-4
00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.202
<v Josh Sparkes>Now that will be.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/27-0
00:03:42.882 --> 00:03:47.066
<v Josh Sparkes>Request for interview is A is A is a
briefing, isn't it? Rather,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/27-1
00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:51.893
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a briefing in order to reach the
partners ahead of the interview that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/27-2
00:03:51.893 --> 00:03:57.363
<v Josh Sparkes>they're going to have with the researcher.
OK, so is it a standard template? I mean,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/27-3
00:03:57.363 --> 00:04:01.482
<v Josh Sparkes>there's no such thing as standard on
these things depending on.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/28-0
00:04:01.962 --> 00:04:03.885
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh,
if you understand the submission</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/28-1
00:04:03.885 --> 00:04:06.276
<v Josh Sparkes>information,
so it's utilising the submission</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/28-2
00:04:06.276 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Josh Sparkes>information to put into everything on the
back of that open submission of the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/28-3
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.449
<v Josh Sparkes>submission thing,
it would pre populate or at least outline</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/28-4
00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:17.451
<v Josh Sparkes>a briefing for that interview that's
going to be conducted. Is that correct?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/28-5
00:04:17.451 --> 00:04:18.282
<v Josh Sparkes>It populates it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/29-0
00:04:18.802 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Josh Sparkes>Thanks so much submission.
So we are populated. Yeah, OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/29-1
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.524
<v Josh Sparkes>that's what you. Yeah.
So the reading Doc is essentially a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/29-2
00:04:26.524 --> 00:04:30.484
<v Josh Sparkes>summary of these submission documents. OK,
yeah. Just like,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/29-3
00:04:30.484 --> 00:04:34.642
<v Josh Sparkes>summarise all the informations.
For example, what our ranking?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/30-0
00:04:35.362 --> 00:04:38.773
<v Josh Sparkes>Last year,
ranking is was the competitor ranking,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/30-1
00:04:38.773 --> 00:04:43.821
<v Josh Sparkes>so sometimes they may talk about the
parlours may want to raise this out.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/30-2
00:04:43.821 --> 00:04:49.278
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably we think we should be ranked
higher than our first current ranking and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/30-3
00:04:49.278 --> 00:04:49.482
<v Josh Sparkes>so.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/31-0
00:04:50.202 --> 00:04:55.121
<v Josh Sparkes>Each submission open submission.
Each submission we do is, you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/31-1
00:04:55.121 --> 00:05:00.252
<v Josh Sparkes>unique to what's being requested to in
order to then take this briefing</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/31-2
00:05:00.252 --> 00:05:03.602
<v Josh Sparkes>interview document by calling it a right
name.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/32-0
00:05:06.962 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there standard things in there that
just get pre populated so extracts that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/32-1
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.954
<v Josh Sparkes>info or you extract that information from
that submission and pre populate the form</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/32-2
00:05:15.954 --> 00:05:19.429
<v Josh Sparkes>in a standard format?
It's always the same fields that need to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/32-3
00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:20.642
<v Josh Sparkes>be populated. Yeah OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/33-0
00:05:21.522 --> 00:05:24.405
<v Josh Sparkes>That's in my mind,
not jumping ahead or solutionizing.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/33-1
00:05:24.405 --> 00:05:27.498
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know how at all. Mark.
I'm going to say something,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/33-2
00:05:27.498 --> 00:05:31.796
<v Josh Sparkes>but that's certainly something that maybe
we can think about about pre populating</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/33-3
00:05:31.796 --> 00:05:35.727
<v Josh Sparkes>in the future if that's possible or we
might bend too much that you can't,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/33-4
00:05:35.727 --> 00:05:36.722
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's certainly.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/34-0
00:05:37.082 --> 00:05:42.806
<v Josh Sparkes>There's another project that I'm involved
with for AI that's looking at the whole</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/34-1
00:05:42.806 --> 00:05:44.202
<v Josh Sparkes>directories process.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/35-0
00:05:45.602 --> 00:05:49.265
<v Josh Sparkes>12 week period.
That's just about to cut off. What's that?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/35-1
00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.562
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's to try and ultimate or or?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/36-0
00:05:53.162 --> 00:05:58.327
<v Josh Sparkes>Submission process. Interview briefing.
Hopefully as part of that process.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/36-1
00:05:58.327 --> 00:06:01.770
<v Josh Sparkes>So the whole end time that we've
discussed today,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/36-2
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.557
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a project to replace all of that
not replaced,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/36-3
00:06:05.557 --> 00:06:08.242
<v Josh Sparkes>but how AI externally can support that?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/37-0
00:06:08.882 --> 00:06:14.688
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, we can discuss that further.
So is that about to kick off? Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/37-1
00:06:14.688 --> 00:06:19.820
<v Josh Sparkes>and probably Alex.
So who's the PM or certainly when we talk</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/37-2
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.522
<v Josh Sparkes>about service now and AI,
that's something.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/38-0
00:06:24.522 --> 00:06:29.142
<v Josh Sparkes>Has it got a name of the project
directory AI support?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/38-1
00:06:29.142 --> 00:06:35.442
<v Josh Sparkes>It's all through said so I would assume
so, but there's been no PM put up.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/39-0
00:06:39.882 --> 00:06:50.379
<v Josh Sparkes>Quantum Quantum I'll have it's quantum
Astros directory's automation kick off.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/39-1
00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:55.162
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it? I think no problem. Take off.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/41-0
00:06:55.642 --> 00:06:58.404
<v Josh Sparkes>Is about the,
so this is this introduction with the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/41-1
00:06:58.404 --> 00:07:02.122
<v Josh Sparkes>provider and then the project initiation
documents with the presence.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/42-0
00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:10.192
<v Josh Sparkes>Quantum quantum. So, yeah,
they're they're the external provider</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/42-1
00:07:10.192 --> 00:07:12.642
<v Josh Sparkes>that we're going to work more.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/43-0
00:07:16.362 --> 00:07:21.783
<v Josh Sparkes>For for the purposes only of pre
populating from that open submission to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/43-1
00:07:21.783 --> 00:07:25.719
<v Josh Sparkes>this briefing documents briefing into
your document.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/43-2
00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:30.546
<v Josh Sparkes>And I'm not just saying just a another.
So the referee template,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/43-3
00:07:30.546 --> 00:07:32.922
<v Josh Sparkes>the interview briefing document.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/44-0
00:07:34.202 --> 00:07:39.005
<v Josh Sparkes>And submission OK can I add that if you
don't mind the parking lot with a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/44-1
00:07:39.005 --> 00:07:43.677
<v Josh Sparkes>discussion of any overlap that can be
achieved there from so now, yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/44-2
00:07:43.677 --> 00:07:47.830
<v Josh Sparkes>potentially. Well, yeah.
And if how it plays into this process,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/44-3
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.816
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah,
I wonder if that's like an experimental</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/44-4
00:07:50.816 --> 00:07:52.762
<v Josh Sparkes>project. They don't know what.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/45-0
00:07:52.882 --> 00:07:55.136
<v Josh Sparkes>The outcomes are, or. Yeah,
nothing's been.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/45-1
00:07:55.136 --> 00:07:57.645
<v Josh Sparkes>It's pretty much that kick off is
introductions,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/45-2
00:07:57.645 --> 00:08:01.434
<v Josh Sparkes>confirming project outcomes and timelines
aligning on an engagement plan.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/45-3
00:08:01.434 --> 00:08:04.609
<v Josh Sparkes>It's all very, yeah,
I don't think we can assume that's going</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/45-4
00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:06.811
<v Josh Sparkes>to. No,
I'm not saying it's going to solve</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/45-5
00:08:06.811 --> 00:08:09.526
<v Josh Sparkes>anything.
It's just it ties into what you're saying.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/45-6
00:08:09.526 --> 00:08:10.242
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, exactly.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/46-0
00:08:12.002 --> 00:08:15.269
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so that then gets so the press comes in,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/46-1
00:08:15.269 --> 00:08:19.696
<v Josh Sparkes>goes into your queue.
Is that again a global process it sits</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/46-2
00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:23.326
<v Josh Sparkes>with ask clients for interview we can,
yes, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/46-3
00:08:23.326 --> 00:08:26.882
<v Josh Sparkes>Whoever and is it the person that worked
on the?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/47-0
00:08:27.762 --> 00:08:31.065
<v Josh Sparkes>On that open,
open submission would also be the same</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/47-1
00:08:31.065 --> 00:08:35.303
<v Josh Sparkes>person that's doing the interview,
and it could be any. Not really.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/47-2
00:08:35.303 --> 00:08:39.416
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be any one of the teams,
it could be anyone. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/47-3
00:08:39.416 --> 00:08:43.467
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's not always if I was to look at
the end to end workflow.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/47-4
00:08:43.467 --> 00:08:44.962
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not always part of.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/48-0
00:08:45.322 --> 00:08:48.670
<v Josh Sparkes>The end to every workflow,
it's it could be requested.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/48-1
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.504
<v Josh Sparkes>You don't always do it.
It's not the natural step from 1:00 to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/48-2
00:08:52.504 --> 00:08:55.851
<v Josh Sparkes>2:00, you know, everyone,
as far as I know, we're not.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/48-3
00:08:55.851 --> 00:08:59.502
<v Josh Sparkes>Everyone gets an. OK.
So do you take it as a separate? Yes.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/48-4
00:08:59.502 --> 00:09:02.362
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's completely separate because not
every.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/49-0
00:09:02.762 --> 00:09:07.425
<v Josh Sparkes>Submission upwards get gets an interview.
Do they know in advance that this will be</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/49-1
00:09:07.425 --> 00:09:11.588
<v Josh Sparkes>getting an interview just from that
e-mail from the researcher? That's oh,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/49-2
00:09:11.588 --> 00:09:14.363
<v Josh Sparkes>that's it.
So it's post submission that you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/49-3
00:09:14.363 --> 00:09:18.360
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, you're going to get that.
So the researchers usually reach out by</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/49-4
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.189
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail, then ask them to, like,
fix a date and time convenient above</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/49-5
00:09:22.189 --> 00:09:22.522
<v Josh Sparkes>above.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/50-0
00:09:22.682 --> 00:09:28.022
<v Josh Sparkes>One party. OK, we'll do the interview.
So in show world today you get this has</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/50-1
00:09:28.022 --> 00:09:31.943
<v Josh Sparkes>been requested.
This is potentially the interview window,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/50-2
00:09:31.943 --> 00:09:35.187
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe all due data that that will be
conducted.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/50-3
00:09:35.187 --> 00:09:39.242
<v Josh Sparkes>And then from that you start to then
populate the briefing.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/51-0
00:09:40.762 --> 00:09:44.375
<v Josh Sparkes>Document based on the open submission.
Is that right?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/51-1
00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:49.794
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's in Word or real template your
stamp from your standard templates that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/51-2
00:09:49.794 --> 00:09:53.206
<v Josh Sparkes>you have. OK,
so it goes from again using the same</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/51-3
00:09:53.206 --> 00:09:55.882
<v Josh Sparkes>language, new assigned work in progress.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/52-0
00:09:56.602 --> 00:10:00.162
<v Josh Sparkes>Does it need to be reviewed by anybody or
is there any?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/53-0
00:10:03.762 --> 00:10:08.469
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah,
this is like done by some junior Member</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/53-1
00:10:08.469 --> 00:10:14.713
<v Josh Sparkes>who may not have a lot of experience in
doing this type of work,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/53-2
00:10:14.713 --> 00:10:17.402
<v Josh Sparkes>then probably will run that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/54-0
00:10:18.242 --> 00:10:24.455
<v Josh Sparkes>A small check on on the on the output.
Otherwise it's just completed and send it</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/54-1
00:10:24.455 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Josh Sparkes>back with your request OK and so close
and then sent back.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/54-2
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:34.042
<v Josh Sparkes>So you attach the briefing again to and
that's not something you.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/56-0
00:10:34.642 --> 00:10:38.724
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably about that conversation that
we're going to park about whole content</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/56-1
00:10:38.724 --> 00:10:41.706
<v Josh Sparkes>management and where it's stored.
Once you sent it back,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/56-2
00:10:41.706 --> 00:10:45.422
<v Josh Sparkes>it does it get stored? Do they extract it,
store it anywhere? Does it?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/56-3
00:10:45.422 --> 00:10:49.241
<v Josh Sparkes>Or do they tend to then take it off,
e-mail it to whoever is going to be</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/56-4
00:10:49.241 --> 00:10:51.962
<v Josh Sparkes>interviewed to give them that briefing
information?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/57-0
00:10:52.562 --> 00:10:57.332
<v Josh Sparkes>We save the the documents in,
I manage you do save them. Yes, we do.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/57-1
00:10:57.332 --> 00:11:01.134
<v Josh Sparkes>Save them. OK,
so save them all in the same folders as</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/57-2
00:11:01.134 --> 00:11:06.802
<v Josh Sparkes>the submission documentation. OK. Yeah.
So we have, like, if this is going to be.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/58-0
00:11:07.922 --> 00:11:13.379
<v Josh Sparkes>From the draught to the final submissions
and the interview breathing Doc,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/58-1
00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:18.035
<v Josh Sparkes>they're all saved in the same folder on I
manage. OK, yeah. OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/58-2
00:11:18.035 --> 00:11:19.562
<v Josh Sparkes>And so maybe in that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/59-0
00:11:21.842 --> 00:11:24.980
<v Josh Sparkes>Briefing document.
Would you then reference the open</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/59-1
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.117
<v Josh Sparkes>lighting show,
or do you reference the original open</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/59-2
00:11:28.117 --> 00:11:31.491
<v Josh Sparkes>submission document?
Is there any references that you do</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/59-3
00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:32.082
<v Josh Sparkes>currently?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/60-0
00:11:35.242 --> 00:11:39.736
<v Josh Sparkes>Because we need because we need to know
the exact the the exact submission</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/60-1
00:11:39.736 --> 00:11:43.750
<v Josh Sparkes>documents in order to pay to prepare that
interview breeding dock.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/60-2
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:48.364
<v Josh Sparkes>So we need to know what is the what?
What was the the practise area that was</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/60-3
00:11:48.364 --> 00:11:49.322
<v Josh Sparkes>submitted? Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/61-0
00:11:49.802 --> 00:11:53.594
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not Martin Parrack or Josh,
not solutionizing here,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/61-1
00:11:53.594 --> 00:11:58.739
<v Josh Sparkes>but maybe that's a sub task of the open
submission that therefore you don't</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/61-2
00:11:58.739 --> 00:12:02.192
<v Josh Sparkes>always do these briefing for direct for
directors,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/61-3
00:12:02.192 --> 00:12:07.405
<v Josh Sparkes>but it could be a sub task that is
already that parent child is a child task</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/61-4
00:12:07.405 --> 00:12:08.962
<v Josh Sparkes>of the open submission.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/62-0
00:12:09.642 --> 00:12:13.790
<v Josh Sparkes>And therefore you've already got that
link and then the link to this briefing</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/62-1
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.395
<v Josh Sparkes>document.
Then we triggered to the requester and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/62-2
00:12:16.395 --> 00:12:18.362
<v Josh Sparkes>they can see that information in the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/63-0
00:12:20.602 --> 00:12:21.522
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, second, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/64-0
00:12:23.802 --> 00:12:29.211
<v Josh Sparkes>That sounded a lot easier from
directories and then there's this</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/64-1
00:12:29.211 --> 00:12:34.454
<v Josh Sparkes>deadline. Sorry. Of course.
Did you say that's sometimes after</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/64-2
00:12:34.454 --> 00:12:38.199
<v Josh Sparkes>submissions,
there's sometimes an interview,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/64-3
00:12:38.199 --> 00:12:40.362
<v Josh Sparkes>and sometimes there isn't.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/65-0
00:12:40.882 --> 00:12:44.548
<v Josh Sparkes>What are the like differences? Like what?
How?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/65-1
00:12:44.548 --> 00:12:49.071
<v Josh Sparkes>How do you know when you know it's an
external? We don't.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/65-2
00:12:49.071 --> 00:12:53.205
<v Josh Sparkes>It's OK based on the director, provider,
researcher.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/65-3
00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:56.402
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's dependent on researcher deciding.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/66-0
00:12:56.962 --> 00:13:01.076
<v Josh Sparkes>Who they're going to interview,
and it'll be probably a selection of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/66-1
00:13:01.076 --> 00:13:05.309
<v Josh Sparkes>percentage that they need to interview.
So it's not every time, right.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/66-2
00:13:05.309 --> 00:13:09.601
<v Josh Sparkes>And do you have any actions to do there?
If there is an interview like,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/66-3
00:13:09.601 --> 00:13:13.893
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know, any like briefings,
like any extra document or something.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/66-4
00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:15.562
<v Josh Sparkes>Just the interview document.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/67-0
00:13:16.402 --> 00:13:19.636
<v Josh Sparkes>There's no interview.
There is no breaking document. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/67-1
00:13:19.636 --> 00:13:23.691
<v Josh Sparkes>All right. OK. It's a sub task.
It can come as a result of the submission</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/67-2
00:13:23.691 --> 00:13:27.033
<v Josh Sparkes>that's been submitted. All right.
Do you get a clue? I mean,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/67-3
00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:30.485
<v Josh Sparkes>that's a good question.
Do you get clues that these might land</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/67-4
00:13:30.485 --> 00:13:33.061
<v Josh Sparkes>into? There's no rhyme or reason.
It could be.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/67-5
00:13:33.061 --> 00:13:35.362
<v Josh Sparkes>It's probably just a selection and that's.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/68-0
00:13:35.842 --> 00:13:38.219
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
they'll do so many percentage of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/68-1
00:13:38.219 --> 00:13:42.424
<v Josh Sparkes>whoever's task to that research.
And is that into just my knowledge?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/68-2
00:13:42.424 --> 00:13:47.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that a good thing to have been to?
Is it something that we want? Yeah. OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/68-3
00:13:47.177 --> 00:13:52.114
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know whether there was any self
promotion in the detail that we give for</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/68-4
00:13:52.114 --> 00:13:55.282
<v Josh Sparkes>the open submission to channel that into,
you know.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/69-0
00:13:55.442 --> 00:13:58.607
<v Josh Sparkes>It's something that the reputation
branding that you want.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/69-1
00:13:58.607 --> 00:14:02.897
<v Josh Sparkes>I wonder if there's some things that in
that open submission or that submission</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/69-2
00:14:02.897 --> 00:14:05.365
<v Josh Sparkes>process,
you could almost include to get that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/69-3
00:14:05.365 --> 00:14:08.207
<v Josh Sparkes>interview apart from can we have an
interview? Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/69-4
00:14:08.207 --> 00:14:12.122
<v Josh Sparkes>I think I don't even think it's as
technical as that. I think it's just.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/71-0
00:14:12.642 --> 00:14:17.643
<v Josh Sparkes>A selection of how many that researcher
has then has to reach out a tough</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/71-1
00:14:17.643 --> 00:14:23.049
<v Josh Sparkes>percentage of OK people. OK. All right.
I just want to make sure there's a good</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/71-2
00:14:23.049 --> 00:14:28.522
<v Josh Sparkes>thing rather than than sanity checking
any discrepancies. No, it's a good thing.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/72-0
00:14:31.002 --> 00:14:37.322
<v Josh Sparkes>Deadline announcement.
Where does that come into that?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/73-0
00:14:39.082 --> 00:14:40.562
<v Josh Sparkes>And when it's told.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/74-0
00:14:42.562 --> 00:14:48.052
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think this is this is the additional
was that part of the submission leading</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/74-1
00:14:48.052 --> 00:14:52.136
<v Josh Sparkes>up to that date. Yeah.
So the moment that we learn about the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/74-2
00:14:52.136 --> 00:14:55.149
<v Josh Sparkes>submission deadline of that particular
time,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/74-3
00:14:55.149 --> 00:14:58.362
<v Josh Sparkes>then we'll send out and write an e-mail
to CNG.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/75-0
00:14:59.402 --> 00:15:04.241
<v Josh Sparkes>And letting them know that this guide the
submission deadline is on a certain date,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/75-1
00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:08.446
<v Josh Sparkes>and we also provide with all the
guidelines and the policy you could do,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/75-2
00:15:08.446 --> 00:15:13.111
<v Josh Sparkes>you'll be doing that upfront anyway with
you as part of that when you're sending</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/75-3
00:15:13.111 --> 00:15:13.802
<v Josh Sparkes>your guides.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/76-0
00:15:15.182 --> 00:15:19.741
<v Josh Sparkes>Would you be announcing that deadline is
associated with the guides and there's</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/76-1
00:15:19.741 --> 00:15:24.186
<v Josh Sparkes>deadlines associated with submissions?
Yeah, this is a submission associated.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/76-2
00:15:24.186 --> 00:15:26.750
<v Josh Sparkes>This one is associated with the
submissions,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/76-3
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.625
<v Josh Sparkes>so it's that first part is spoken about
where you're communicating,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/76-4
00:15:30.625 --> 00:15:33.702
<v Josh Sparkes>what the deadlines are. OK,
for each of the captions.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/77-0
00:15:34.522 --> 00:15:39.110
<v Josh Sparkes>That was, yeah,
so that almost needs to go before the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/77-1
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:43.273
<v Josh Sparkes>submission. OK.
So if I had it in order deadline</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/77-2
00:15:43.273 --> 00:15:47.860
<v Josh Sparkes>announcement,
open submission briefing for interview.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/77-3
00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:53.722
<v Josh Sparkes>Right. Yep. And then any other.
So they say the interviews happened.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/78-0
00:15:55.602 --> 00:16:00.104
<v Josh Sparkes>Is any of that you don't touch that
that's outside of show or what you do</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/78-1
00:16:00.104 --> 00:16:04.849
<v Josh Sparkes>today or do you get to know feedback of
that interview when it was conducted,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/78-2
00:16:04.849 --> 00:16:08.134
<v Josh Sparkes>how it went,
don't need to know feed into any metrics</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/78-3
00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:10.202
<v Josh Sparkes>that you would like to have known?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/79-0
00:16:11.442 --> 00:16:11.562
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/80-0
00:16:13.962 --> 00:16:17.672
<v Josh Sparkes>Any other tasks on the back of that open
submission?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/80-1
00:16:17.672 --> 00:16:21.592
<v Josh Sparkes>The deadline for net or is that where it
stops posting?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/80-2
00:16:21.592 --> 00:16:26.982
<v Josh Sparkes>To view the things and then they get
published so that at that stage we move</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/80-3
00:16:26.982 --> 00:16:28.802
<v Josh Sparkes>on to the the gate launch?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/81-0
00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:33.701
<v Josh Sparkes>Process into the oh,
so this is then the guide launch.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/81-1
00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:39.060
<v Josh Sparkes>But it says after you say, OK. Yeah,
so that's for the port says more so. OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/81-2
00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.083
<v Josh Sparkes>so no one's going to request that a
launch.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/81-3
00:16:42.083 --> 00:16:44.762
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just an action that we need to do.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/82-0
00:16:45.202 --> 00:16:51.211
<v Josh Sparkes>And a lot of directories is because the
time record and we need to report back to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/82-1
00:16:51.211 --> 00:16:56.706
<v Josh Sparkes>the business around the time statement
directories because of the analysis</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/82-2
00:16:56.706 --> 00:17:00.442
<v Josh Sparkes>that's performed between US client time,
CMG time.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/83-0
00:17:00.922 --> 00:17:06.036
<v Josh Sparkes>We will take so this isn't this isn't on
the the guide launch isn't on the back of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/83-1
00:17:06.036 --> 00:17:09.362
<v Josh Sparkes>the individual submissions and interviews.
This is a.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/84-0
00:17:11.562 --> 00:17:16.055
<v Josh Sparkes>Part on client group LED guide launch it
was it's not one to one.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/84-1
00:17:16.055 --> 00:17:21.161
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not one open submission 1 guide
launch that comes out the back of it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/84-2
00:17:21.161 --> 00:17:24.224
<v Josh Sparkes>So the guidelines comes off the back of
all.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/84-3
00:17:24.224 --> 00:17:27.968
<v Josh Sparkes>So like we've we've submitted for that
deadline. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/84-4
00:17:27.968 --> 00:17:30.282
<v Josh Sparkes>And that deadline was for a guide.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/85-0
00:17:30.722 --> 00:17:33.786
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
that needs to be launched right with the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/85-1
00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:34.602
<v Josh Sparkes>results, OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/86-0
00:17:36.442 --> 00:17:39.252
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so there's another sub sub task of that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/86-1
00:17:39.252 --> 00:17:44.297
<v Josh Sparkes>open submission is the guide launch, yes.
So we move to then what would be the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/86-2
00:17:44.297 --> 00:17:47.171
<v Josh Sparkes>outcome of the open to the open
submissions?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/86-3
00:17:47.171 --> 00:17:51.002
<v Josh Sparkes>The interviews that then provides us with
the the guidance.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/87-0
00:17:52.362 --> 00:18:01.442
<v Josh Sparkes>Where we get embargoed rankings is the
first step, so the rankings are then.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/88-0
00:18:03.242 --> 00:18:06.842
<v Josh Sparkes>Who gives? Who's the directory provider?
Emails.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/89-0
00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:11.428
<v Josh Sparkes>Off to notify their Barber rankings.
Right?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/89-1
00:18:11.428 --> 00:18:17.572
<v Josh Sparkes>Because we go for 100 or it's not the one
that's on social. OK, just chamber.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/89-2
00:18:17.572 --> 00:18:23.322
<v Josh Sparkes>Just chambers, I think, Mark, since, like,
I need to check, but I think.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/90-0
00:18:23.722 --> 00:18:27.888
<v Josh Sparkes>Let's go with this an e-mail.
One's two weeks.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/90-1
00:18:27.888 --> 00:18:33.471
<v Josh Sparkes>One's one week with embargoed ahead of
the actual launch date.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/90-2
00:18:33.471 --> 00:18:39.762
<v Josh Sparkes>Team prepares all of the documentation
for practise area rankings and.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/91-0
00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:45.692
<v Josh Sparkes>Individual rankings and there's a
checklist for those that they that they</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/91-1
00:18:45.692 --> 00:18:49.030
<v Josh Sparkes>have to do,
they have to complete that time.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/91-2
00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:54.816
<v Josh Sparkes>So what would that checklist look like
that they've got to complete to launch</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/91-3
00:18:54.816 --> 00:18:56.522
<v Josh Sparkes>the guide? So rankings?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/92-0
00:18:57.362 --> 00:18:58.522
<v Josh Sparkes>Summary document.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/93-0
00:19:00.322 --> 00:19:01.962
<v Josh Sparkes>And then communication, OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/94-0
00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:11.126
<v Josh Sparkes>And the summary document is a template
that you have that you populate OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/94-1
00:19:11.126 --> 00:19:17.475
<v Josh Sparkes>And again is that put into I manage is
that where it lives and then your</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/94-2
00:19:17.475 --> 00:19:19.562
<v Josh Sparkes>communication standards?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/95-0
00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:26.563
<v Josh Sparkes>Template that you then HTML template from
that one. Yeah, you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/95-1
00:19:26.563 --> 00:19:30.031
<v Josh Sparkes>OK and then you attach that did show
today.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/95-2
00:19:30.031 --> 00:19:34.682
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean what does your communication look
like? Is it just?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/96-0
00:19:35.322 --> 00:19:38.878
<v Josh Sparkes>We can't do that one in shareable because
it's HTML,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/96-1
00:19:38.878 --> 00:19:44.312
<v Josh Sparkes>so we have to take that out of shareable
and then like come with the CMI number,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/96-2
00:19:44.312 --> 00:19:49.477
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, good to take it in service now.
So what does the communication look like</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/96-3
00:19:49.477 --> 00:19:50.282
<v Josh Sparkes>or what you?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/97-0
00:19:50.842 --> 00:19:57.789
<v Josh Sparkes>Communicating what details on that form,
it was easier to show you an example</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/97-1
00:19:57.789 --> 00:20:04.647
<v Josh Sparkes>because that could be a subtask that
communication could be the next subtask</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/97-2
00:20:04.647 --> 00:20:06.962
<v Josh Sparkes>down that's pre populated.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/98-0
00:20:07.482 --> 00:20:11.122
<v Josh Sparkes>You know the details of that HTML and
then.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/99-0
00:20:12.442 --> 00:20:20.962
<v Josh Sparkes>I suppose the things who doesn't then go
to join.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/101-0
00:20:26.962 --> 00:20:30.110
<v Josh Sparkes>Emily. Sorry, it's me.
I've seen 10 and apologies because I've</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/101-1
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.507
<v Josh Sparkes>obviously missed a lot of it.
So you might have already covered it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/101-2
00:20:33.507 --> 00:20:37.354
<v Josh Sparkes>but just before you mentioned there
around not doing it in sharewell because</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/101-3
00:20:37.354 --> 00:20:39.402
<v Josh Sparkes>it's like HTML. Is that when you use the?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/103-0
00:20:40.282 --> 00:20:44.281
<v Josh Sparkes>The thing under the actions list that's
like generate CMI? Yeah. Cool. No worries.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/103-1
00:20:44.281 --> 00:20:44.762
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/104-0
00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:54.555
<v Josh Sparkes>I imagine service no can deal with HT.
That's what we're just saying.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/104-1
00:20:54.555 --> 00:20:58.522
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can take take that form.
That's good. That's a self help.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/105-0
00:21:00.162 --> 00:21:00.282
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/106-0
00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:04.739
<v Josh Sparkes>So this is the the e-mail that we sent
out.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/106-1
00:21:04.739 --> 00:21:10.659
<v Josh Sparkes>So we got like images and yeah formatting
like, yeah, it's a standard template.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/106-2
00:21:10.659 --> 00:21:16.654
<v Josh Sparkes>But this is a outlook template and then
we've got the attachment of the separate</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/106-3
00:21:16.654 --> 00:21:19.762
<v Josh Sparkes>document and also the ranking spreadsheet.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/107-0
00:21:20.522 --> 00:21:23.326
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so there are spreadsheet goes first as</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/107-1
00:21:23.326 --> 00:21:26.261
<v Josh Sparkes>well.
So there's like stages to it where the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/107-2
00:21:26.261 --> 00:21:29.261
<v Josh Sparkes>spreadsheet goes first with all the
rankings,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/107-3
00:21:29.261 --> 00:21:34.217
<v Josh Sparkes>and then there's a couple of days
turnover for the summary document because</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/107-4
00:21:34.217 --> 00:21:36.042
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a much bigger document.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/108-0
00:21:36.642 --> 00:21:42.147
<v Josh Sparkes>And there's two quality cheques there.
Following each of those documents. OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/108-1
00:21:42.147 --> 00:21:47.441
<v Josh Sparkes>so you would have so it populates so
effectively you're putting the social</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/108-2
00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:51.322
<v Josh Sparkes>link in, there's a digital link,
there's URL in there.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/109-0
00:21:52.402 --> 00:21:58.069
<v Josh Sparkes>Can populate so it could be in ServiceNow.
You've captured social URL, you enter it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/109-1
00:21:58.069 --> 00:22:02.669
<v Josh Sparkes>digital URL entered and then that
populates again not to solutionise</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/109-2
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:07.402
<v Josh Sparkes>marketing and how it can see on the
screen that it then populates the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/110-0
00:22:08.122 --> 00:22:11.437
<v Josh Sparkes>The communication that needs to be to be
sent out,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/110-1
00:22:11.437 --> 00:22:16.635
<v Josh Sparkes>there's the types of things that you add
presumably is the orange links are the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/110-2
00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:21.444
<v Josh Sparkes>ones that you're pre populating,
is that right? As well as other details.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/110-3
00:22:21.444 --> 00:22:24.303
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I think the these are all the mail to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/110-4
00:22:24.303 --> 00:22:26.642
<v Josh Sparkes>link. So they say the same standard.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/111-0
00:22:27.922 --> 00:22:28.922
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, they're just standard.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/113-0
00:22:28.562 --> 00:22:31.985
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, they,
I'd see I'd see those as being unchanging,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/113-1
00:22:31.985 --> 00:22:36.154
<v Mark Sedge>just produced out of the, you know,
out of the rules to create the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/112-0
00:22:32.162 --> 00:22:32.322
<v Josh Sparkes>Just.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/113-2
00:22:36.154 --> 00:22:36.962
<v Mark Sedge>notification.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/114-0
00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:38.002
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah. And then.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/115-0
00:22:41.882 --> 00:22:47.743
<v Josh Sparkes>So which bits you change? Yeah,
we change the the name of the service</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/115-1
00:22:47.743 --> 00:22:54.524
<v Josh Sparkes>directory provider and the guide and here.
And so all those details will come as</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/115-2
00:22:54.524 --> 00:22:56.282
<v Josh Sparkes>part of the original.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/116-0
00:22:56.602 --> 00:23:01.708
<v Josh Sparkes>Submission. You've got those details.
That description here at the top that's</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/116-1
00:23:01.708 --> 00:23:06.028
<v Josh Sparkes>been actually already, OK,
you've done permission here. Yeah, OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/116-2
00:23:06.028 --> 00:23:11.002
<v Josh Sparkes>And they've got the dates. OK. Yeah.
I mean, a copy of that would be great.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/116-3
00:23:11.002 --> 00:23:13.162
<v Josh Sparkes>And then that gets pre populated.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/117-0
00:23:13.762 --> 00:23:16.560

<v Josh Sparkes>there's lots of people that you will
notify their standards. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/117-2
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.780
<v Josh Sparkes>These are all the main group that we need
to set out. But always. No, no, no.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/117-3
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.722
<v Josh Sparkes>Depends on the the game. Yeah.
It's not the same. So if like.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/118-0
00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:35.803
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just speaking to if guide one,
e-mail these if certain guides to e-mail</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/118-1
00:23:35.803 --> 00:23:40.119
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be pre they're pre populated,
they're not ad hoc,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/118-2
00:23:40.119 --> 00:23:44.655
<v Josh Sparkes>they're the same group presumably.
Are they depending on? OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/118-3
00:23:44.655 --> 00:23:49.922
<v Josh Sparkes>it's all depends on the the jurisdiction
of the guide book for example.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/119-0
00:23:50.122 --> 00:23:54.552
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, this UK, of course,
is sent to the UK group if it is APEC</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/119-1
00:23:54.552 --> 00:23:57.597
<v Josh Sparkes>guide that was sent to APEC Group.
OK yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/119-2
00:23:57.597 --> 00:24:03.411
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can get that we can get that matrix
and then that can be people and then they</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/119-3
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:05.002
<v Josh Sparkes>get notified. Yeah. OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/120-0
00:24:09.362 --> 00:24:14.489
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's the rankings of each practise
area. Each individual lawyer,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/120-1
00:24:14.489 --> 00:24:19.842
<v Josh Sparkes>and then the summary document is your
ranking summary and your quotes.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/121-0
00:24:21.562 --> 00:24:28.095
<v Josh Sparkes>So you thought that happened? Yeah.
So this is this is the outcome of. Sorry.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/121-1
00:24:28.095 --> 00:24:33.540
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah. So this one question. Yeah.
So this is the UK guide.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/121-2
00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.722
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've got different at this areas.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/122-0
00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:45.561
<v Josh Sparkes>And perfect when you click into without
the different location and then it comes</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/122-1
00:24:45.561 --> 00:24:46.362
<v Josh Sparkes>up with.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/123-0
00:24:49.002 --> 00:24:53.707
<v Josh Sparkes>Ranking paper like this.
So this is the all the different ranking</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/123-1
00:24:53.707 --> 00:24:59.551
<v Josh Sparkes>of the global firm in in the UK. Yeah.
Yeah. So this is for the party department.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/123-2
00:24:59.551 --> 00:25:05.111
<v Josh Sparkes>So if some practise area they also have
the lawyers ranking then we will have</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/123-3
00:25:05.111 --> 00:25:06.322
<v Josh Sparkes>another tap here.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/124-0
00:25:08.602 --> 00:25:08.722
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/125-0
00:25:10.722 --> 00:25:15.178
<v Josh Sparkes>That visualises it quite nicely.
Doesn't let on that screen,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/125-1
00:25:15.178 --> 00:25:20.801
<v Josh Sparkes>we're just talking about those bands,
so you've done the ranking summary and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/125-2
00:25:20.801 --> 00:25:25.402
<v Josh Sparkes>then communication, right, secretary?
All that guide and then.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/126-0
00:25:26.802 --> 00:25:30.450
<v Josh Sparkes>The QCs as well.
There's an extra QC on the documents that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/126-1
00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:34.962
<v Josh Sparkes>the team does sort of need to go to
someone else in the team or I'm just</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/126-2
00:25:34.962 --> 00:25:39.166
<v Josh Sparkes>thinking about like this. Yeah.
Or to assign is if we need to go to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/126-3
00:25:39.166 --> 00:25:42.319
<v Josh Sparkes>somewhere else.
But it can go between the regions.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/126-4
00:25:42.319 --> 00:25:45.162
<v Josh Sparkes>And is there a such that that QC is a
subset?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/127-0
00:25:45.882 --> 00:25:50.499
<v Josh Sparkes>Again, like we talked about before,
is there a subset of the group or it</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/127-1
00:25:50.499 --> 00:25:55.242
<v Josh Sparkes>could be to anybody? No, no, it does.
It needs to be the DNA. OK, experts.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/128-0
00:25:58.442 --> 00:26:09.300
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes. Awards. Oh, sorry. Awards comes next,
but presumably we can take it in the same</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/128-1
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.642
<v Josh Sparkes>and then that's the end once it's.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/129-0
00:26:15.122 --> 00:26:17.686
<v Josh Sparkes>Communicate this.
That's the end of the process.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/129-1
00:26:17.686 --> 00:26:18.522
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that correct?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/130-0
00:26:20.282 --> 00:26:26.456
<v Josh Sparkes>Although yeah, then,
then we there's some nice housekeeping</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/130-1
00:26:26.456 --> 00:26:34.790
<v Josh Sparkes>tasks because as we mentioned earlier,
where it means we are sending out the the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/130-2
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.362
<v Josh Sparkes>first e-mail saying that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/131-0
00:26:38.042 --> 00:26:42.567
<v Josh Sparkes>The for example,
the UK guy is now accepting submissions.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/131-1
00:26:42.567 --> 00:26:48.652
<v Josh Sparkes>We also released the information about
the previous ranking, so I need, yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/131-2
00:26:48.652 --> 00:26:52.162
<v Josh Sparkes>so we need to like put in this year
ranking.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/132-0
00:26:53.002 --> 00:26:55.997
<v Josh Sparkes>On in the table.
So to let the CMG knows what's the the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/132-1
00:26:55.997 --> 00:26:58.511
<v Josh Sparkes>the ranking of that particular practise
areas.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/132-2
00:26:58.511 --> 00:27:02.790
<v Josh Sparkes>In the past three years and then they
will make the decision whether it's going</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/132-3
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.747
<v Josh Sparkes>to be in school or not in school.
But so when you do that step one at the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/132-4
00:27:06.747 --> 00:27:10.224
<v Josh Sparkes>beginning sending out,
that's what you're saying you you include</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/132-5
00:27:10.224 --> 00:27:12.202
<v Josh Sparkes>the previous rankings that have been.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/133-0
00:27:14.202 --> 00:27:18.616
<v Josh Sparkes>You catch it so,
but what's the housekeeping that you just</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/133-1
00:27:18.616 --> 00:27:23.253
<v Josh Sparkes>mentioned that compose this this activity?
Yeah, there. Well,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/133-2
00:27:23.253 --> 00:27:28.564
<v Josh Sparkes>there's the credentials capture,
which is the extraction of all of the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/133-3
00:27:28.564 --> 00:27:29.162
<v Josh Sparkes>matters.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/134-0
00:27:30.362 --> 00:27:35.752
<v Josh Sparkes>From the submissions put into an excel
sheet which is a bulk upload template</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/134-1
00:27:35.752 --> 00:27:39.602
<v Josh Sparkes>sheet that then needs to go to CMG for
them to review,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/134-2
00:27:39.602 --> 00:27:44.712
<v Josh Sparkes>make sure we all have the information
ready for it to go back to the bed</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/134-3
00:27:44.712 --> 00:27:47.162
<v Josh Sparkes>content team to upload intercourse.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/135-0
00:27:47.522 --> 00:27:50.606
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, so you remember the coral boss. Yes.
Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/135-1
00:27:50.606 --> 00:27:56.116
<v Josh Sparkes>that's the that's the all the information.
But if that coral boss is not completed,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/135-2
00:27:56.116 --> 00:28:01.167
<v Josh Sparkes>then we need to go back to CMG and ask
them to provide that information. OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/135-3
00:28:01.167 --> 00:28:03.922
<v Josh Sparkes>so that depends on what to get us. OK, so.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/136-0
00:28:06.642 --> 00:28:09.497
<v Josh Sparkes>But if we can just close that,
we'll go back to the process.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/136-1
00:28:09.497 --> 00:28:11.791
<v Josh Sparkes>And so at the end of this,
so I just catch that,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/136-2
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:15.254
<v Josh Sparkes>but this is the post activity on
directory response to where it is in the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/136-3
00:28:15.254 --> 00:28:15.722
<v Josh Sparkes>processes.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/137-0
00:28:19.762 --> 00:28:24.082
<v Josh Sparkes>For all that matter is that come as a
report is that in reporting that we can</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/137-1
00:28:24.082 --> 00:28:27.627
<v Josh Sparkes>capture or is that an activity that's
done on the back of this,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/137-2
00:28:27.627 --> 00:28:32.224
<v Josh Sparkes>it's off the back of the open submission.
So when you've done this submission, oh,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/137-3
00:28:32.224 --> 00:28:34.716
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
and that's what we're talking about that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/137-4
00:28:34.716 --> 00:28:36.322
<v Josh Sparkes>point that you then exported.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/138-0
00:28:36.682 --> 00:28:41.742
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, I think we discussed that, didn't we?
Yeah, it's that extraction. OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/138-1
00:28:41.742 --> 00:28:45.912
<v Josh Sparkes>it's that extraction.
But it was the housekeeping that we're</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/138-2
00:28:45.912 --> 00:28:51.039
<v Josh Sparkes>talking about at the end of this,
that so we've got all the tracker stuff.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/138-3
00:28:51.039 --> 00:28:53.842
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that we need to update the tracker.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/139-0
00:28:54.522 --> 00:28:54.682
<v Josh Sparkes>Really.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/140-0
00:28:56.882 --> 00:29:02.399
<v Josh Sparkes>And this is the tracker where only a
subset of the information from ServiceNow</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/140-1
00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:07.567
<v Josh Sparkes>is available and you then need to update
the tracker which has a lot more</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/140-2
00:29:07.567 --> 00:29:09.242
<v Josh Sparkes>information essentially.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/141-0
00:29:12.032 --> 00:29:14.784
<v Josh Sparkes>And there's that. Literally,
typing in taking it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/141-1
00:29:14.784 --> 00:29:19.297
<v Josh Sparkes>and then there'll be an opportunity where
we extract some of the information here</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/141-2
00:29:19.297 --> 00:29:22.214
<v Josh Sparkes>and then it repopulates that tracker.
I mean, again,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/141-3
00:29:22.214 --> 00:29:25.240
<v Josh Sparkes>not to solutionize our part back with
Mark and Parrot,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/141-4
00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.432
<v Josh Sparkes>but if you need that information more
than double keying.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/142-0
00:29:28.802 --> 00:29:33.989
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be an opportunity there where it
it it you take that information and it is</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/142-1
00:29:33.989 --> 00:29:38.002
<v Josh Sparkes>pre populated whether it's a you know an
extract from that yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/143-0
00:29:39.522 --> 00:29:39.642
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/144-0
00:29:40.842 --> 00:29:42.602
<v Josh Sparkes>Well, did you get the pirate?
Keep up that *****.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/147-0
00:29:46.082 --> 00:29:49.871
<v Mark Sedge>Certainly heard it.
I think that your your points are made.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/147-1
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:52.839
<v Mark Sedge>Are you?
I'm assuming you're just going to put</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/147-2
00:29:52.839 --> 00:29:57.575
<v Mark Sedge>that as a requirement for for the
architects to provide you with the right</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/145-0
00:29:52.962 --> 00:29:53.082
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/146-0
00:29:55.002 --> 00:29:55.122
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/147-3
00:29:57.575 --> 00:29:58.522
<v Mark Sedge>solution, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/148-0
00:29:59.202 --> 00:30:03.885
<v Josh Sparkes>I was. We can discuss it, but yes,
it will land. The solution is, yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/148-1
00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:08.177
<v Josh Sparkes>I won't solutionize it here,
but it's something you would like to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/150-0
00:30:07.442 --> 00:30:10.447
<v Mark Sedge>No. So so we just I think, yeah,
sorry Deborah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/148-2
00:30:08.177 --> 00:30:09.802
<v Josh Sparkes>recall. It's not exactly.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/150-1
00:30:10.447 --> 00:30:15.391
<v Mark Sedge>My point was let's just grab it as a
clear requirement and then we'll work out</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/149-0
00:30:13.282 --> 00:30:17.562
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/150-2
00:30:15.391 --> 00:30:19.522
<v Mark Sedge>what the solution actually is. Neither.
Yeah. Perfect. Very good.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/151-0
00:30:19.202 --> 00:30:23.508
<v Josh Sparkes>They're not double keying that you don't.
You're not between the two screens.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/151-1
00:30:23.508 --> 00:30:26.213
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be. Do you take that information?
Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/151-2
00:30:26.213 --> 00:30:28.973
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's we're we're currently
Mandel peel.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/151-3
00:30:28.973 --> 00:30:32.671
<v Josh Sparkes>You can pull a report from Cheryl right
now on the categorization.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/151-4
00:30:32.671 --> 00:30:36.866
<v Josh Sparkes>The time spent and how that feeds in
would typically be how we we visit the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/151-5
00:30:36.866 --> 00:30:38.522
<v Josh Sparkes>the admin associated with the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/152-0
00:30:38.562 --> 00:30:43.258
<v Josh Sparkes>The tracker at the moment. OK,
so that's one piece of housekeeping.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/152-1
00:30:43.258 --> 00:30:47.333
<v Josh Sparkes>Anything else for the tracker or any
anything in addition,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/152-2
00:30:47.333 --> 00:30:52.719
<v Josh Sparkes>the only thing that I'm thinking that
we're doing at the moment or looking at</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/152-3
00:30:52.719 --> 00:30:53.962
<v Josh Sparkes>with social media?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/154-0
00:30:55.082 --> 00:30:58.256
<v Josh Sparkes>As the first to market and the social
tiles.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/154-1
00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:02.276
<v Josh Sparkes>So where we're talking about social being
in the e-mail,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/154-2
00:31:02.276 --> 00:31:08.129
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a part where we're going to start
to share the embargoed rankings with the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/154-3
00:31:08.129 --> 00:31:09.962
<v Josh Sparkes>social media team and the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/155-0
00:31:10.722 --> 00:31:15.298
<v Josh Sparkes>Design team to get first to market.
Were they on that e-mail trail when you</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/155-1
00:31:15.298 --> 00:31:19.813
<v Josh Sparkes>said they're on that e-mail trail?
But this will happen at the point where</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/155-2
00:31:19.813 --> 00:31:23.425
<v Josh Sparkes>we do embargoed right?
So it's an early notification to the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/155-3
00:31:23.425 --> 00:31:26.556
<v Josh Sparkes>design and social team about what the
rankings are,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/155-4
00:31:26.556 --> 00:31:28.482
<v Josh Sparkes>but with nothing to go external.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/156-0
00:31:29.242 --> 00:31:31.700
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so because it's a workflow in there or</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/156-1
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.671
<v Josh Sparkes>notification within there that they get
wins. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/156-2
00:31:34.671 --> 00:31:39.471
<v Josh Sparkes>for the social that we share that OK that
we share that information nothing and you</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/156-3
00:31:39.471 --> 00:31:42.271
<v Josh Sparkes>do that the point as you said is this is
an art.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/156-4
00:31:42.271 --> 00:31:46.842
<v Josh Sparkes>This is only our in flight at the moment
of discussion a more just an awareness</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/156-5
00:31:46.842 --> 00:31:47.642
<v Josh Sparkes>piece but the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/157-0
00:31:48.602 --> 00:31:56.634
<v Josh Sparkes>The only thing that did happen this time
was sharing the practise level rankings</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/157-1
00:31:56.634 --> 00:31:57.922
<v Josh Sparkes>for band One.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/158-0
00:31:59.522 --> 00:32:04.262
<v Josh Sparkes>Design to create the tailors to be part
of that. That's that's another action.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/158-1
00:32:04.262 --> 00:32:08.642
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's when we can come back to
because but they get that insight.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/158-2
00:32:08.642 --> 00:32:12.902
<v Josh Sparkes>The first markets. Yeah. Yeah.
The view is basically the partners went</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/158-3
00:32:12.902 --> 00:32:17.582
<v Josh Sparkes>first market when we when we had gate
launch day they want to be able to talk</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/158-4
00:32:17.582 --> 00:32:18.722
<v Josh Sparkes>about the rankings.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/159-0
00:32:18.842 --> 00:32:23.079
<v Josh Sparkes>Our socials and in order to do that,
we can do it same day because we don't</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/159-1
00:32:23.079 --> 00:32:25.755
<v Josh Sparkes>get the information,
we get embargoed rankings,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/159-2
00:32:25.755 --> 00:32:28.263
<v Josh Sparkes>but they can't be released until the day
of.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/159-3
00:32:28.263 --> 00:32:32.834
<v Josh Sparkes>So what that does is restrain our design
team so the view is to share and prepare</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/159-4
00:32:32.834 --> 00:32:34.562
<v Josh Sparkes>as much as possible in advance.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/160-0
00:32:34.842 --> 00:32:38.802
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So that we're ready to share on.
It's those triggers that we talked about,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/160-1
00:32:38.802 --> 00:32:42.567
<v Josh Sparkes>I think probably 9:15 this morning.
Who knows what when and it's giving them</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/160-2
00:32:42.567 --> 00:32:45.158
<v Josh Sparkes>that foresight. Yeah,
actually this is coming. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/160-3
00:32:45.158 --> 00:32:48.042
<v Josh Sparkes>it's that early notification. Yeah. Yeah.
OK. That's good.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/161-0
00:32:51.962 --> 00:32:59.554
<v Josh Sparkes>Any other housekeeping on the back of
that or we always the tracker the more</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/161-1
00:32:59.554 --> 00:33:05.568
<v Josh Sparkes>this morning, yeah,
this morning sounds probably a long time</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/161-2
00:33:05.568 --> 00:33:05.962
<v Josh Sparkes>ago.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/162-0
00:33:08.282 --> 00:33:12.159
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
We don't think about this is this is the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/162-1
00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:16.896
<v Josh Sparkes>process of one guy launch,
but are we talking, but OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/162-2
00:33:16.896 --> 00:33:23.357
<v Josh Sparkes>we've talked about one guy launch,
but this is the same workflow everyone,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/162-3
00:33:23.357 --> 00:33:24.562
<v Josh Sparkes>no exceptions.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/163-0
00:33:25.522 --> 00:33:30.882
<v Josh Sparkes>Apart from the the apart from the
interview, yeah, well and supported.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/164-0
00:33:32.362 --> 00:33:35.962
<v Josh Sparkes>So we don't have the open submissions,
just the upload, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/165-0
00:33:37.842 --> 00:33:41.266
<v Josh Sparkes>So for that's the late for late as well.
Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/165-1
00:33:41.266 --> 00:33:47.165
<v Josh Sparkes>So some of the as we mentioned earlier
chambers being our preference directories</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/165-2
00:33:47.165 --> 00:33:52.337
<v Josh Sparkes>but for some of the your office they
prefer legal 500 either they swap</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/165-3
00:33:52.337 --> 00:33:57.362
<v Josh Sparkes>chambers with legal 500 and then we can
support with the submission.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/166-0
00:33:57.602 --> 00:34:03.303
<v Josh Sparkes>Drop and everything or they can keep
chambers and then they do legal 500</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/166-1
00:34:03.303 --> 00:34:08.848
<v Josh Sparkes>themselves. So in that case,
legal 500 being the unsupported directory</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/166-2
00:34:08.848 --> 00:34:12.909
<v Josh Sparkes>submissions,
we are not involved in any drafting or</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/166-3
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:16.580
<v Josh Sparkes>reports,
we just help them to upload the final</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/166-4
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.282
<v Josh Sparkes>document.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/167-0
00:34:17.322 --> 00:34:21.484
<v Josh Sparkes>To the to the,
to the portal and they you would get a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/167-1
00:34:21.484 --> 00:34:26.955
<v Josh Sparkes>request to upload that, yeah, OK.
And that's a separate request. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/167-2
00:34:26.955 --> 00:34:32.812
<v Josh Sparkes>So we got like I would upload upload
request that was one of the very yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/167-3
00:34:32.812 --> 00:34:34.122
<v Josh Sparkes>That wasn't just.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/168-0
00:34:35.562 --> 00:34:38.268
<v Josh Sparkes>So this one is for the unsupported
directory,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/168-1
00:34:38.268 --> 00:34:42.855
<v Josh Sparkes>so we still need visibility of all of
that because it ties into the admin the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/168-2
00:34:42.855 --> 00:34:46.795
<v Josh Sparkes>historical data information and what we
need to communicate. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/168-3
00:34:46.795 --> 00:34:50.323
<v Josh Sparkes>but at the time, do they do?
Can I just ask, is that legal?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/168-4
00:34:50.323 --> 00:34:54.322
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's something that their
preference, if you've got chambers.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/169-0
00:34:54.562 --> 00:34:57.470
<v Josh Sparkes>We've done a lot of work,
we're doing that,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/169-1
00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:03.087
<v Josh Sparkes>but they might want legal 500 unsupported.
Could that be a sub task that even though</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/169-2
00:35:03.087 --> 00:35:07.382
<v Josh Sparkes>you're not supporting it,
it's still triggered that you they can</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/169-3
00:35:07.382 --> 00:35:12.074
<v Josh Sparkes>use that information apart from chambers
to to do the work themselves?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/169-4
00:35:12.074 --> 00:35:14.122
<v Josh Sparkes>Or is it a query that comes in?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/170-0
00:35:14.322 --> 00:35:16.771
<v Josh Sparkes>Says just.
So I'm saying that they use that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/170-1
00:35:16.771 --> 00:35:18.162
<v Josh Sparkes>information assuming the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/171-0
00:35:19.602 --> 00:35:22.884
<v Josh Sparkes>Process to do it themselves and the bit
that you're doing,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/171-1
00:35:22.884 --> 00:35:25.832
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got sub tasks that they're going
to be doing.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/171-2
00:35:25.832 --> 00:35:29.336
<v Josh Sparkes>The legal 500 themselves and your bit is
just to upload or do.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/171-3
00:35:29.336 --> 00:35:33.562
<v Josh Sparkes>Would you prefer just as a separate query
that says assistance with upload?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/172-0
00:35:34.842 --> 00:35:38.927
<v Josh Sparkes>How'd you get it today?
Right now it's a sustenance with upload,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/172-1
00:35:38.927 --> 00:35:42.005
<v Josh Sparkes>right?
Because then we would just track the time</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/172-2
00:35:42.005 --> 00:35:45.147
<v Josh Sparkes>that we spent observations,
not the overall time.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/172-3
00:35:45.147 --> 00:35:49.294
<v Josh Sparkes>That includes legal and.
But did you do the chambers bit for them</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/172-4
00:35:49.294 --> 00:35:49.482
<v Josh Sparkes>so?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/173-0
00:35:49.882 --> 00:35:54.323
<v Josh Sparkes>Two different things because you've got
like for like which is then where a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/173-1
00:35:54.323 --> 00:35:56.894
<v Josh Sparkes>category aligns for chambers and legal
500.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/173-2
00:35:56.894 --> 00:35:59.933
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can then take a chamber submission
directly,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/173-3
00:35:59.933 --> 00:36:04.666
<v Josh Sparkes>upload it to legal 500 if the category
aligns. If that doesn't. If that doesn't,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/173-4
00:36:04.666 --> 00:36:08.522
<v Josh Sparkes>then you can't do that.
You have to believe what that's supposed.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/174-0
00:36:09.722 --> 00:36:13.242
<v Josh Sparkes>And support and support with the legal
teams and.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/175-0
00:36:15.242 --> 00:36:17.769
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
they're they're still seen as separate.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/175-1
00:36:17.769 --> 00:36:20.296
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so it's a separate request that you would</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/175-2
00:36:20.296 --> 00:36:24.250
<v Josh Sparkes>that you managed to share well,
just for your time at the moment. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/175-3
00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:27.875
<v Josh Sparkes>and that is, it's coming.
I need you to do you get forewarning or</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/175-4
00:36:27.875 --> 00:36:31.500
<v Josh Sparkes>is it this is this is it,
you get it in its final state or almost</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/175-5
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.642
<v Josh Sparkes>to be told send out fines yes from the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/176-0
00:36:34.202 --> 00:36:38.717
<v Josh Sparkes>The PE legal team that they're going to
be suspecting on the deadline date. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/176-1
00:36:38.717 --> 00:36:41.194
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
It's that early notification through the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/176-2
00:36:41.194 --> 00:36:43.617
<v Josh Sparkes>you get that.
So they complete the request.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/176-3
00:36:43.617 --> 00:36:46.039
<v Josh Sparkes>It's generally just an e-mail for that
one.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/176-4
00:36:46.039 --> 00:36:49.122
<v Josh Sparkes>And then when they do the upload itself
or request. OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/177-0
00:36:50.042 --> 00:36:53.921
<v Josh Sparkes>But moving forward,
removing e-mail they can fill in that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/177-1
00:36:53.921 --> 00:36:59.003
<v Josh Sparkes>request form that says give you that
early hindsight of it and then request</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/177-2
00:36:59.003 --> 00:37:03.684
<v Josh Sparkes>for upload. Yeah. OK, that's good.
What's do you need any additional?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/177-3
00:37:03.684 --> 00:37:07.362
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm going to discuss lots of bills today.
Do you need?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/178-0
00:37:07.962 --> 00:37:12.121
<v Josh Sparkes>Additional information. I mean,
what do you get today that you think</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/178-1
00:37:12.121 --> 00:37:16.882
<v Josh Sparkes>actually they could provide a bit more
information that would be very helpful.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/179-0
00:37:20.882 --> 00:37:23.846
<v Josh Sparkes>Or is it,
you know doesn't need to be over</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/179-1
00:37:23.846 --> 00:37:25.362
<v Josh Sparkes>cumbersome as a whole?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/180-0
00:37:27.202 --> 00:37:31.322
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the key information is there for
what we need on that form. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/180-1
00:37:31.322 --> 00:37:34.050
<v Josh Sparkes>on that form already. Yeah.
If they complete it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/180-2
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:38.002
<v Josh Sparkes>then we use that form. Yeah, we have.
What we what we need to proceed.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/181-0
00:37:39.682 --> 00:37:47.356
<v Josh Sparkes>Just one thing is on reporting purposes.
You know sometimes they send us all all</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/181-1
00:37:47.356 --> 00:37:54.840
<v Josh Sparkes>submissions in one single e-mail and ask
us to upload and then we need to like</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/181-2
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.682
<v Josh Sparkes>split up into four cases just.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/182-0
00:37:58.002 --> 00:38:02.120
<v Josh Sparkes>To make sure that we are,
we are working on four different</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/182-1
00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:06.935
<v Josh Sparkes>submissions, not just one actually.
I mean the form within the week.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/182-2
00:38:06.935 --> 00:38:11.053
<v Josh Sparkes>I was going to sneeze.
It could be that in one form or one</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/182-3
00:38:11.053 --> 00:38:15.310
<v Josh Sparkes>request it could be add another add
another. So you get one.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/182-4
00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.682
<v Josh Sparkes>But actually the separate task so.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/183-0
00:38:17.882 --> 00:38:22.611
<v Josh Sparkes>But that's certainly the case that
they're just in one place they don't have</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/183-1
00:38:22.611 --> 00:38:25.312
<v Josh Sparkes>to.
So doing 1 submission but four requests</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/183-2
00:38:25.312 --> 00:38:29.672
<v Josh Sparkes>and they get separated out,
that's possible as well. So that you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/183-3
00:38:29.672 --> 00:38:34.707
<v Josh Sparkes>so the for them is the customer at that
point the customer of using the form is a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/183-4
00:38:34.707 --> 00:38:36.242
<v Josh Sparkes>good experience for them.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/184-0
00:38:37.002 --> 00:38:41.809
<v Josh Sparkes>But that's certainly possible that we've
discussed it in across some of our other</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/184-1
00:38:41.809 --> 00:38:46.030
<v Josh Sparkes>workshops that will be for their
experience. They're just adding, yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/184-2
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:49.547
<v Josh Sparkes>that's certainly possible and it
separates it, as you said,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/184-3
00:38:49.547 --> 00:38:54.002
<v Josh Sparkes>four different tasks and to manage your
workload rather than one task with.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/185-0
00:38:54.802 --> 00:39:01.098
<v Josh Sparkes>4 bits of information. Yeah. OK.
Was there one last one at the end?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/185-1
00:39:01.098 --> 00:39:05.727
<v Josh Sparkes>Historical. Was it historical query?
Is it? Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/185-2
00:39:05.727 --> 00:39:09.522
<v Josh Sparkes>Historical Directory submission supports.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/186-0
00:39:09.842 --> 00:39:09.962
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/187-0
00:39:11.442 --> 00:39:15.984
<v Josh Sparkes>So sometimes they ask us for pass a copy
of the past submissions.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/187-1
00:39:15.984 --> 00:39:20.320
<v Josh Sparkes>Then we just send the,
send them to send the document to them.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/187-2
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:25.688
<v Josh Sparkes>They can't. I mean, it's just make sense.
So they can they self-serve and see</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/187-3
00:39:25.688 --> 00:39:30.642
<v Josh Sparkes>what's there themselves? Yes.
But it's always quicker to ask of course.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/188-0
00:39:30.882 --> 00:39:35.676
<v Josh Sparkes>Get served rather than just go into the I
manage and look for look for they could</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/188-1
00:39:35.676 --> 00:39:38.247
<v Josh Sparkes>do that.
So if we're looking at a knowledge</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/188-2
00:39:38.247 --> 00:39:43.216
<v Josh Sparkes>article or before they get the request to
say, you know, you could do this yourself.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/188-3
00:39:43.216 --> 00:39:45.788
<v Josh Sparkes>See,
I mean it's actually the team is busy.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/188-4
00:39:45.788 --> 00:39:48.827
<v Josh Sparkes>They're not.
You're not waiting for them to ask you</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/188-5
00:39:48.827 --> 00:39:49.762
<v Josh Sparkes>these questions.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/189-0
00:39:50.242 --> 00:39:54.053
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be it could be a leading that
they actually then go and instructions</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/189-1
00:39:54.053 --> 00:39:57.961
<v Josh Sparkes>how to do it and then when they asked you
again, OK, the first time they do it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/189-2
00:39:57.961 --> 00:40:00.110
<v Josh Sparkes>it was a little bit slower than asking
you.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/189-3
00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:03.432
<v Josh Sparkes>But the second time actually they're not
waiting for your response.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/189-4
00:40:03.432 --> 00:40:07.096
<v Josh Sparkes>That's certainly an opportunity.
If they can do it or if they're not doing</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/189-5
00:40:07.096 --> 00:40:07.682
<v Josh Sparkes>it, why not?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/190-0
00:40:08.162 --> 00:40:11.935
<v Josh Sparkes>If not, why not? It's a good transfer.
They certainly can do it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/190-1
00:40:11.935 --> 00:40:15.242
<v Josh Sparkes>and it's available to them.
That's a push back and that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/196-0
00:40:15.042 --> 00:40:20.150
<v Mark Sedge>And what you what you could do is for
those where you've got the the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/196-1
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:25.628
<v Mark Sedge>opportunity for your audience to
self-serve is you could consciously do a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/191-0
00:40:25.322 --> 00:40:25.442
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/196-2
00:40:25.628 --> 00:40:31.031
<v Mark Sedge>delay in there in responding to them.
So through a service level kind of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/192-0
00:40:27.322 --> 00:40:27.442
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/193-0
00:40:28.642 --> 00:40:28.762
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/194-0
00:40:30.602 --> 00:40:30.722
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/196-3
00:40:31.031 --> 00:40:34.362
<v Mark Sedge>expectation if they get it fast,
self-serve.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/195-0
00:40:34.002 --> 00:40:34.122
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/198-0
00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:38.642
<v Mark Sedge>But if they come through and it's
something they can self-serve,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/198-1
00:40:38.642 --> 00:40:42.115
<v Mark Sedge>you basically hold it back so that so
they it it's they,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/198-2
00:40:42.115 --> 00:40:45.953
<v Mark Sedge>it incentivizes them to help themselves
rather than, you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/198-3
00:40:45.953 --> 00:40:49.242
<v Mark Sedge>keep coming to you to to spoon feed them
so to speak.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/199-0
00:40:49.842 --> 00:40:54.156
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be that they still submit it,
but the pop-up might be, you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/199-1
00:40:54.156 --> 00:40:57.129
<v Josh Sparkes>the team will get back to you there what
you know.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/199-2
00:40:57.129 --> 00:41:00.743
<v Josh Sparkes>But but you can go and often do it.
And if they, as you said,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/199-3
00:41:00.743 --> 00:41:05.523
<v Josh Sparkes>if they get it before you great but or it
could be that we just you push back and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/199-4
00:41:05.523 --> 00:41:08.962
<v Josh Sparkes>that's a change in behaviour because
otherwise it will be.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/201-0
00:41:09.882 --> 00:41:12.977
<v Josh Sparkes>They'll be coming for everything,
won't they? You know?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/201-1
00:41:12.977 --> 00:41:16.901
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it part of their roles and
responsibility that it should be getting</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/201-2
00:41:16.901 --> 00:41:19.388
<v Josh Sparkes>this information themselves as well?
I mean,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/201-3
00:41:19.388 --> 00:41:23.920
<v Josh Sparkes>I know in historically it's probably it's
just quicker to ask and then I can move</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/201-4
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.849
<v Josh Sparkes>on to my next,
I think the the other part of that is</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/201-5
00:41:26.849 --> 00:41:28.562
<v Josh Sparkes>though is the like the ranking.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/202-0
00:41:29.002 --> 00:41:34.435
<v Josh Sparkes>Information as well and like I'm just
thinking about the one for growing up,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/202-1
00:41:34.435 --> 00:41:38.526
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's like an ongoing updated sheet
with the rankings.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/202-2
00:41:38.526 --> 00:41:43.324
<v Josh Sparkes>So although we're talking about like a
copy of the submission, yes,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/202-3
00:41:43.324 --> 00:41:45.722
<v Josh Sparkes>but then there's information like.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/203-0
00:41:46.002 --> 00:41:49.716
<v Josh Sparkes>What's on the word?
A sort of directors tracker that they</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/203-1
00:41:49.716 --> 00:41:53.814
<v Josh Sparkes>they could self-serve with.
If we create a copy of and then the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/203-2
00:41:53.814 --> 00:41:58.873
<v Josh Sparkes>location so they can't mess with it.
But these are the ones that these are the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/203-3
00:41:58.873 --> 00:42:02.330
<v Josh Sparkes>ones that are.
It's more like the banking information</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/203-4
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:02.842
<v Josh Sparkes>and the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/204-0
00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:08.799
<v Josh Sparkes>Practise serious information,
because then that information can then</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/204-1
00:42:08.799 --> 00:42:11.833
<v Josh Sparkes>lead them to a capability statement.
For example, OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/204-2
00:42:11.833 --> 00:42:16.441
<v Josh Sparkes>so it sounds like there was simple ones
that they could self-serve and then there</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/204-3
00:42:16.441 --> 00:42:19.981
<v Josh Sparkes>are other ones that you may want to
handle yourself, you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/204-4
00:42:19.981 --> 00:42:21.722
<v Josh Sparkes>so we could separate those out.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/205-0
00:42:22.642 --> 00:42:24.804
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
But certainly if you look at the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/205-1
00:42:24.804 --> 00:42:29.128
<v Josh Sparkes>self-serve ones, if not, why not?
So they can push back are the ones that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/205-2
00:42:29.128 --> 00:42:33.802
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe are slightly more complex you know
and how many was the volumes on those?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/206-0
00:42:38.562 --> 00:42:42.370
<v Josh Sparkes>You get more.
That's like seasonal where you get a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/206-1
00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:47.896
<v Josh Sparkes>little from sometimes I think it's not
not in the top five, no, it's not.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/206-2
00:42:47.896 --> 00:42:52.898
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not one of our high usage ones.
It just when it comes around,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/206-3
00:42:52.898 --> 00:42:55.362
<v Josh Sparkes>I would say it's people girdling.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/207-0
00:42:56.002 --> 00:42:58.937
<v Josh Sparkes>They're more time consuming. Yeah,
when they're requested.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/207-1
00:42:58.937 --> 00:43:02.768
<v Josh Sparkes>And this is an opportunity. I know.
We'll talk on knowledge as we get to the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/207-2
00:43:02.768 --> 00:43:06.349
<v Josh Sparkes>end. It's an opportunity of that.
If they can do it themselves. If not,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/207-3
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:08.836
<v Josh Sparkes>why not? And push back between now and,
you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/207-4
00:43:08.836 --> 00:43:11.522
<v Josh Sparkes>just getting that mindset of you can do
it. It isn't.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/208-0
00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:17.189
<v Josh Sparkes>Stuff on the Internet shows you how to do
it is a role. If I go off and do it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/208-1
00:43:17.189 --> 00:43:20.656
<v Josh Sparkes>but certainly pushing towards if they can
do stuff.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/208-2
00:43:20.656 --> 00:43:26.056
<v Josh Sparkes>I know it's easier to ask someone else.
There's definitely. That's a big change.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/208-3
00:43:26.056 --> 00:43:27.322
<v Josh Sparkes>I think for CMG is.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/209-0
00:43:27.562 --> 00:43:30.339
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
the behaviour of that because the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/209-1
00:43:30.339 --> 00:43:34.921
<v Josh Sparkes>expectation is 100% that ask client will
just provide that, yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/209-2
00:43:34.921 --> 00:43:39.364
<v Josh Sparkes>there was not that I guess agreement that
they will self-serve.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/209-3
00:43:39.364 --> 00:43:44.362
<v Josh Sparkes>So that would need to be set as part of
the change and the expectation.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/210-0
00:43:47.042 --> 00:43:52.059
<v Josh Sparkes>Good opportunity to manage that, you know,
not not to the point where it's like what</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/210-1
00:43:52.059 --> 00:43:55.305
<v Josh Sparkes>I asked client doing,
it wanted so much that you strip</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/210-2
00:43:55.305 --> 00:43:58.433
<v Josh Sparkes>everything.
But certainly the quick wins they can do</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/210-3
00:43:58.433 --> 00:43:59.082
<v Josh Sparkes>themselves.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/211-0
00:43:59.962 --> 00:44:03.981
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a moment to inform Ruth she gets
back to the CMG behaviour, isn't it?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/211-1
00:44:03.981 --> 00:44:06.393
<v Josh Sparkes>Again,
I've got the time for her as well for</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/211-2
00:44:06.393 --> 00:44:08.482
<v Josh Sparkes>Ruth, so she can listen to that change.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/212-0
00:44:12.242 --> 00:44:15.705
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe two awards. It's a good place to.
Yeah, he could.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/212-1
00:44:15.705 --> 00:44:20.405
<v Josh Sparkes>And he said or was that the break?
I mean we can do awards in the same way.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/212-2
00:44:20.405 --> 00:44:24.362
<v Josh Sparkes>So you get the awards to start that one.
Yeah. Chaplain awards.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/213-0
00:44:27.642 --> 00:44:30.668
<v Josh Sparkes>Again,
is this open for entry same sort of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/213-1
00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:34.748
<v Josh Sparkes>process open for entry?
You get informed that this is the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/213-2
00:44:34.748 --> 00:44:37.562
<v Josh Sparkes>timeline that when it's going to happen.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/214-0
00:44:39.082 --> 00:44:41.307
<v Mark Sedge>Josh,
would you mind sharing your screen again,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/214-1
00:44:41.307 --> 00:44:42.882
<v Mark Sedge>so if you've switched screens out?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/215-0
00:44:42.122 --> 00:44:42.362
<v Josh Sparkes>Why not?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/217-0
00:44:45.962 --> 00:44:48.642
<v Mark Sedge>It's only where Mandy was sharing and you
need to switch back.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/216-0
00:44:46.482 --> 00:44:46.722
<v Josh Sparkes>What?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/220-0
00:44:48.562 --> 00:44:51.520
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so maybe houses that a bit like</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/219-0
00:44:51.362 --> 00:44:51.682
<v Mark Sedge>So.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/220-1
00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:55.711
<v Josh Sparkes>directories,
how does all your life staff you get?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/220-2
00:44:55.711 --> 00:45:01.381
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean it's probably much bigger subject,
it can come from anywhere,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/220-3
00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:05.242
<v Josh Sparkes>but other regular awards that you attend
plus?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/221-0
00:45:05.762 --> 00:45:11.695
<v Josh Sparkes>All the other ad hoc ones that you get,
you know, wind of that,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/221-1
00:45:11.695 --> 00:45:18.370
<v Josh Sparkes>you can also be part of, right.
So awards as you know from the provider</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/221-2
00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:19.482
<v Josh Sparkes>to say that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/222-0
00:45:21.282 --> 00:45:22.482
<v Josh Sparkes>It's open for submission.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/223-0
00:45:25.162 --> 00:45:31.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Then we engage with PR.
If it's one of the supported ones with PR.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/223-1
00:45:31.101 --> 00:45:36.596
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's the CMG LED submission,
we engage with the CMG. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/223-2
00:45:36.596 --> 00:45:42.002
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm sure nothing's on the blacklist,
but generally speaking.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/224-0
00:45:42.562 --> 00:45:48.396
<v Josh Sparkes>We're following the rule of what's on the
tiered last.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/224-1
00:45:48.396 --> 00:45:56.562
<v Josh Sparkes>Then we're reaching out to see if we
wanted to submit to the relevant PRCMG.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/226-0
00:45:58.682 --> 00:46:03.003
<v Josh Sparkes>See if it's something that they want to
proceed with and who makes that decision.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/226-1
00:46:03.003 --> 00:46:06.218
<v Josh Sparkes>They make that decision.
They work with the legal teams. OK?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/226-2
00:46:06.218 --> 00:46:10.539
<v Josh Sparkes>To determine whether or not they want to
submit. So the first point you get wind.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/226-3
00:46:10.539 --> 00:46:12.962
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean,
do you know there's no regular wards?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/227-0
00:46:13.322 --> 00:46:15.646
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
so there's regular ones that we submit</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/227-1
00:46:15.646 --> 00:46:19.363
<v Josh Sparkes>every year. Generally speaking,
we know when they're coming around, OK?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/227-2
00:46:19.363 --> 00:46:22.718
<v Josh Sparkes>So let's be scheduled contacts and
they're already pre approved.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/227-3
00:46:22.718 --> 00:46:27.004
<v Josh Sparkes>We know that we're going to be entering
those do we tend to enter them every year?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/227-4
00:46:27.004 --> 00:46:29.430
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, the ones that are on that last year,
OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/227-5
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.682
<v Josh Sparkes>so there's a lot of already information
presets been approved.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/228-0
00:46:33.082 --> 00:46:38.253
<v Josh Sparkes>You don't need to get approval to proceed.
That's done. Maybe should talk about that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/228-1
00:46:38.253 --> 00:46:43.244
<v Josh Sparkes>Should talk about that. Happy Park first.
So these are the shared good ones. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/228-2
00:46:43.244 --> 00:46:46.190
<v Josh Sparkes>So those ones where they're offering a
proceeds,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/228-3
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:49.437
<v Josh Sparkes>check him with PRCMG Eagle teams.
Then at that point,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/228-4
00:46:49.437 --> 00:46:51.842
<v Josh Sparkes>if they do want to proceed as a case of.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/229-0
00:46:52.282 --> 00:46:58.462
<v Josh Sparkes>In our case and share well for the
support for the draught submission that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/229-1
00:46:58.462 --> 00:47:04.559
<v Josh Sparkes>can be using previous year submissions,
other reporting template from the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/229-2
00:47:04.559 --> 00:47:10.409
<v Josh Sparkes>provider, yeah, this difference, OK,
so it's from the awards provider,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/229-3
00:47:10.409 --> 00:47:11.562
<v Josh Sparkes>so it differs.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/230-0
00:47:12.042 --> 00:47:15.788
<v Josh Sparkes>It differs every year.
It's a lawyer of the year.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/230-1
00:47:15.788 --> 00:47:22.005
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm suggesting that that might be a rule
that they they year on year it might be a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/230-2
00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:27.922
<v Josh Sparkes>different set of criteria that they're
characterizations as to what one so and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/230-3
00:47:27.922 --> 00:47:31.442
<v Josh Sparkes>the e-mail template outlines the areas
person.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/231-0
00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:35.550
<v Josh Sparkes>And they may choose just like long or a
handful, or 1/2.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/231-1
00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:38.739
<v Josh Sparkes>Just depends on what they feel strongly
about.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/231-2
00:47:38.739 --> 00:47:44.303
<v Josh Sparkes>So it comes in to be a regular scheduled
event and some stouts it's in, you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/231-3
00:47:44.303 --> 00:47:48.442
<v Josh Sparkes>the calendar date is on the dashboard.
You know that you're.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/232-0
00:47:48.882 --> 00:47:53.730
<v Josh Sparkes>Approaching that date and you can have,
as you said, the workflow can commence.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/232-1
00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:57.245
<v Josh Sparkes>So you're. I don't know how long it takes,
is it 4 weeks,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/232-2
00:47:57.245 --> 00:47:59.911
<v Josh Sparkes>5 weeks that how long they take to
prepare,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/232-3
00:47:59.911 --> 00:48:04.153
<v Josh Sparkes>but you'll get at least early
transparency of it and then you be auto</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/232-4
00:48:04.153 --> 00:48:05.122
<v Josh Sparkes>assigned, is it?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/233-0
00:48:06.042 --> 00:48:11.210
<v Josh Sparkes>No more activity or it tends to be some
directories where it's like between</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/233-1
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:16.446
<v Josh Sparkes>regions. OK, but you would want so, so,
so those awards known you would know</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/233-2
00:48:16.446 --> 00:48:21.138
<v Josh Sparkes>which location they're in.
So it could be client UK client Australia</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/233-3
00:48:21.138 --> 00:48:21.682
<v Josh Sparkes>already.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/234-0
00:48:22.402 --> 00:48:26.476
<v Josh Sparkes>Populated or also assigned to that group
and they just pick the person that's</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/234-1
00:48:26.476 --> 00:48:29.663
<v Josh Sparkes>going to do the draught submissions. Yeah,
for the stuff up.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/234-2
00:48:29.663 --> 00:48:33.580
<v Josh Sparkes>And that global visibility. Yeah, exactly.
All that global. Yeah, exactly.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/234-3
00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.244
<v Josh Sparkes>That is we captured that that will always
be that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/234-4
00:48:36.244 --> 00:48:40.004
<v Josh Sparkes>Just because you're working in the UK,
you don't get to see the ones in</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/234-5
00:48:40.004 --> 00:48:41.362
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia, so that's fine.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/235-0
00:48:42.282 --> 00:48:47.509
<v Josh Sparkes>So the first stage is that it's assigned
and now work in progress for draught</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/235-1
00:48:47.509 --> 00:48:52.133
<v Josh Sparkes>submission. Is that correct?
That's the first bit template populated</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/235-2
00:48:52.133 --> 00:48:57.694
<v Josh Sparkes>categories define what we're going to be
putting for the awards this year and then</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/235-3
00:48:57.694 --> 00:48:57.962
<v Josh Sparkes>you.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/236-0
00:48:58.482 --> 00:49:04.242
<v Josh Sparkes>You complete that a client? Yeah.
And then you share with CMG.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/237-0
00:49:06.042 --> 00:49:10.500
<v Josh Sparkes>Major revisions with the legal teams,
they may ask someone to direct you,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/237-1
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.055
<v Josh Sparkes>so they may ask us for support about nine
times out of 10.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/237-2
00:49:14.055 --> 00:49:18.693
<v Josh Sparkes>It's done with the legal teams. OK,
so CMG needs to be the touch points plus</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/237-3
00:49:18.693 --> 00:49:20.922
<v Josh Sparkes>the touch point plus the legal teams.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/238-0
00:49:21.522 --> 00:49:25.415
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so CMG would be notified that you've done</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/238-1
00:49:25.415 --> 00:49:30.916
<v Josh Sparkes>that draught submission.
Do you store it anywhere or was there a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/238-2
00:49:30.916 --> 00:49:37.516
<v Josh Sparkes>link? When do you tend to slow down?
And then do CMG negotiate or liaise with</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/238-3
00:49:37.516 --> 00:49:40.562
<v Josh Sparkes>the legal team or is that something?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/239-0
00:49:40.762 --> 00:49:45.265
<v Josh Sparkes>Yourself does CMG, OK?
So they'll manage that side of it and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/239-1
00:49:45.265 --> 00:49:50.580
<v Josh Sparkes>then they come back to yourself with
revisions or we're not going to be</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/239-2
00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:56.412
<v Josh Sparkes>entering that category or what what sort
of columns do they come back with any</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/239-3
00:49:56.412 --> 00:49:57.002
<v Josh Sparkes>changes?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/240-0
00:49:57.242 --> 00:50:01.997
<v Josh Sparkes>So sometimes they they will let us know
whether they are interested in putting</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/240-1
00:50:01.997 --> 00:50:06.571
<v Josh Sparkes>forward in going forward with the
submissions and if they intended to do so</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/240-2
00:50:06.571 --> 00:50:10.904
<v Josh Sparkes>then they will ask us to like make a
draught based on maybe last year's</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/240-3
00:50:10.904 --> 00:50:15.539
<v Josh Sparkes>submissions and then we send back the
draught to CMG and then they work with</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/240-4
00:50:15.539 --> 00:50:16.802
<v Josh Sparkes>the legal team, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/241-0
00:50:17.202 --> 00:50:20.679
<v Josh Sparkes>So we will.
So I we're just saying that we've we've</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/241-1
00:50:20.679 --> 00:50:25.224
<v Josh Sparkes>done that draught submission,
what's the process after that the CNG</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/241-2
00:50:25.224 --> 00:50:29.235
<v Josh Sparkes>have got it, yeah.

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/241-3
00:50:29.235 --> 00:50:34.516
<v Josh Sparkes>us for revisions and others to update.
Sometimes they just work with the legal</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/241-4
00:50:34.516 --> 00:50:36.722
<v Josh Sparkes>team directly. And then the only.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/242-0
00:50:36.762 --> 00:50:42.312
<v Josh Sparkes>Any time they come back with the the the
the day of submission. Yeah. OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/242-1

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/242-2
00:50:47.637 --> 00:50:51.762
<v Josh Sparkes>So effectively you're getting the
approval for CMG to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/243-0
00:50:52.602 --> 00:50:56.465
<v Josh Sparkes>Process it or the fact that you've given
them the draught submission.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/243-1
00:50:56.465 --> 00:51:01.044
<v Josh Sparkes>They can work on it and they can close it,
complete and then no further action for</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/243-2
00:51:01.044 --> 00:51:04.299
<v Josh Sparkes>yourself required.
Could they work on it a bit like we saw</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/243-3
00:51:04.299 --> 00:51:07.002
<v Josh Sparkes>earlier?
They can do all the changes themselves.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/245-0
00:51:07.522 --> 00:51:12.770
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So they can do changes themselves,
but we still need to get it back.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/245-1
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:16.687
<v Josh Sparkes>Final document,
remove all the the current same process</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/245-2
00:51:16.687 --> 00:51:20.465
<v Josh Sparkes>for removing. Yeah. Yeah. OK.
And then at that point,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/245-3
00:51:20.465 --> 00:51:24.173
<v Josh Sparkes>the iterative maybe.
Then give them another draught.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/245-4
00:51:24.173 --> 00:51:25.922
<v Josh Sparkes>They could then check it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/246-0
00:51:27.282 --> 00:51:30.669
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So it like it can go go back and forth</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/246-1
00:51:30.669 --> 00:51:36.237
<v Josh Sparkes>and at that point then remove the
comments before we upload to the portal</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/246-2
00:51:36.237 --> 00:51:40.602
<v Josh Sparkes>and then upload to Portal external
provider Portal. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/246-3
00:51:40.602 --> 00:51:43.762
<v Josh Sparkes>OK that's provided and at that point it's.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/247-0
00:51:44.202 --> 00:51:47.573
<v Josh Sparkes>Been submitted for an old yeah.
And you do all of that?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/247-1
00:51:47.573 --> 00:51:51.004
<v Josh Sparkes>You're the last people that upload to the.
Yeah. I mean,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/247-2
00:51:51.004 --> 00:51:55.939
<v Josh Sparkes>they can do it as well if they're really
not going to do it on time because a lot</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/247-3
00:51:55.939 --> 00:52:00.092
<v Josh Sparkes>of the work providers so stay open till
like midnight their portals.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/247-4
00:52:00.092 --> 00:52:03.522
<v Josh Sparkes>So the process and we get a consistent
level of service.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/248-0
00:52:03.682 --> 00:52:07.145
<v Josh Sparkes>But like they could do it or we should do
it if it is,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/248-1
00:52:07.145 --> 00:52:11.805
<v Josh Sparkes>that wasn't responsibility that you're
doing it as a consistent workflow.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/248-2
00:52:11.805 --> 00:52:15.582
<v Josh Sparkes>It was all on time.
And that's the case scenario that we're</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/248-3
00:52:15.582 --> 00:52:20.682
<v Josh Sparkes>talking through. Yeah. And then it's done.
Yeah. OK, that sounded quite a happy.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/249-0
00:52:21.962 --> 00:52:27.879
<v Josh Sparkes>And then you've got other ones that are
unscheduled. Sorry. I'm just wondering,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/249-1
00:52:27.879 --> 00:52:33.499
<v Josh Sparkes>do you have different awards types and
would that impact how you do things,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/249-2
00:52:33.499 --> 00:52:37.122
<v Josh Sparkes>the categories haven't,
there's only one we are.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/250-0
00:52:37.642 --> 00:52:41.639
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, it's different categories portal.
That's where it differs and that's the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/250-1
00:52:41.639 --> 00:52:45.790
<v Josh Sparkes>only difference I would say is there's
one or provider that I can't think of the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/250-2
00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:48.301
<v Josh Sparkes>name of,
but we basically have to copy and paste</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/250-3
00:52:48.301 --> 00:52:50.812
<v Josh Sparkes>everything and also that portal into the
portal.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/250-4
00:52:50.812 --> 00:52:53.322
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's not an upload of a submission
that's on.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/251-0
00:52:53.962 --> 00:52:58.641
<v Josh Sparkes>Copy and paste from the submission
documented portal.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/251-1
00:52:58.641 --> 00:53:04.965
<v Josh Sparkes>We recommend that they get goods. Yeah.
Yeah. A good solution. Yeah. OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/251-2
00:53:04.965 --> 00:53:11.202
<v Josh Sparkes>that that's a one off, is it? Yeah.
Is that part of the scheduled ones?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/252-0
00:53:11.482 --> 00:53:16.238
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, OK.
But the but the same if we take that as a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/252-1
00:53:16.238 --> 00:53:21.177
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow say upload to the submission,
how you do it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/252-2
00:53:21.177 --> 00:53:28.402
<v Josh Sparkes>whether it's copy or paste or it's the
same how we do it that first, yeah, OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/253-0
00:53:30.602 --> 00:53:33.869
<v Josh Sparkes>And do you get a confirmation that they
could see,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/253-1
00:53:33.869 --> 00:53:38.802
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean assumed you get a confirmation
back, it depends on the provider, yes.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/253-2
00:53:38.802 --> 00:53:43.094
<v Josh Sparkes>And there's no eyes. Look,
I'm just like we've got the submission.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/253-3
00:53:43.094 --> 00:53:47.001
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you very much.
Sometimes they send us a receipt and by</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/253-4
00:53:47.001 --> 00:53:48.282
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail is different.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/254-0
00:53:48.762 --> 00:53:53.022
<v Josh Sparkes>Because sometimes you can attach those as
supporting evidence, but it's actually,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/254-1
00:53:53.022 --> 00:53:55.463
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
confirmation received check box that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/254-2
00:53:55.463 --> 00:53:59.099
<v Josh Sparkes>recently you know that did we?
We didn't win nothing or did they even</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/254-3
00:53:59.099 --> 00:54:01.541
<v Josh Sparkes>get, you know, that sort of questioning?
Well,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/254-4
00:54:01.541 --> 00:54:03.722
<v Josh Sparkes>they definitely got it because we saw the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/255-0
00:54:04.602 --> 00:54:12.040
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you. We received it.
It's just unsuccessful this year. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/255-1
00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:19.922
<v Josh Sparkes>just for supporting evidence moving
forward. OK, so now we've got the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/256-0
00:54:21.442 --> 00:54:23.792
<v Josh Sparkes>Open for entry.
We don't do them every year,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/256-1
00:54:23.792 --> 00:54:25.202
<v Josh Sparkes>but we'd like to, you know.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/257-0
00:54:27.562 --> 00:54:32.141
<v Josh Sparkes>At least submit for these ones. I mean,
if we can go through that process.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/257-1
00:54:32.141 --> 00:54:37.209
<v Josh Sparkes>So how do you hear are the PR team maybe
getting in touch or how do they land with</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/257-2
00:54:37.209 --> 00:54:40.689
<v Josh Sparkes>you currently today?
Is that how we talk about the black</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/257-3
00:54:40.689 --> 00:54:43.802
<v Josh Sparkes>listings or the ones that were were not
supported?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/258-0
00:54:45.122 --> 00:54:48.913
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh any other.
So you've got the scheduled ones and then</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/258-1
00:54:48.913 --> 00:54:53.786
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got these other stuff for
discussion of PR to go forward or like</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/258-2
00:54:53.786 --> 00:54:57.847
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a new award.
So not scheduled not on the blacklist.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/258-3
00:54:57.847 --> 00:55:01.907
<v Josh Sparkes>And it was a new award.
That would be a discussion with PR.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/258-4
00:55:01.907 --> 00:55:04.682
<v Josh Sparkes>So it could likely come in our direction.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/259-0
00:55:04.842 --> 00:55:09.652
<v Josh Sparkes>Then have a discussion in the direction
of PR to see if it's a support one that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/259-1
00:55:09.652 --> 00:55:13.560
<v Josh Sparkes>we would support okay,
and if they do proceed for if you only if</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/259-2
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:17.468
<v Josh Sparkes>it's going to go ahead,
you would still follow the same process,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/259-3
00:55:17.468 --> 00:55:21.556
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got to do the draught submission.
If it's PR LED go as well.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/259-4
00:55:21.556 --> 00:55:24.562
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you've got a PR LED submission it
could be.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/260-0
00:55:24.842 --> 00:55:27.850
<v Josh Sparkes>The PR support are asking for that
support,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/260-1
00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:32.019
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's likely the PR will just run with
the whole process,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/260-2
00:55:32.019 --> 00:55:37.555
<v Josh Sparkes>but our more firm wide submissions so
then would they handle the draughts of it?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/260-3
00:55:37.555 --> 00:55:40.562
<v Josh Sparkes>Are they asking you to still do it? No,
no.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/261-0
00:55:41.122 --> 00:55:46.433
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's on the base, but generally no,
not for our PR LED, OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/261-1
00:55:46.433 --> 00:55:53.346
<v Josh Sparkes>So PR LED is LED by PR as the name would
suggest and the other ones where they're</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/261-2
00:55:53.346 --> 00:55:56.802
<v Josh Sparkes>asking you for when you're asking PR for.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/262-0
00:55:58.322 --> 00:56:01.098
<v Josh Sparkes>Authority to proceed. Then you'll need.
Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/262-1
00:56:01.098 --> 00:56:03.752
<v Josh Sparkes>they're just looked into the
communication.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/262-2
00:56:03.752 --> 00:56:08.579
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're just OK across the award and
the volumes of those that are ad hoc or</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/262-3
00:56:08.579 --> 00:56:11.655
<v Josh Sparkes>unscheduled,
they tend to be not that many because</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/262-4
00:56:11.655 --> 00:56:14.853
<v Josh Sparkes>respect the.
But the tiered awards versus the black,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/262-5
00:56:14.853 --> 00:56:16.602
<v Josh Sparkes>it sounds what you're saying.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/263-0
00:56:16.802 --> 00:56:21.018
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, there's APR, right?
For those ones that fall under the PR</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/263-1
00:56:21.018 --> 00:56:25.035
<v Josh Sparkes>that you're doing,
is there an opportunity to push back that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/263-2
00:56:25.035 --> 00:56:28.658
<v Josh Sparkes>they should be doing all of them or
should they learn,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/263-3
00:56:28.658 --> 00:56:33.202
<v Josh Sparkes>should they in the future or forward
submissions or all PR LED, yes.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/264-0
00:56:33.802 --> 00:56:37.890
<v Josh Sparkes>All the ones where you're requesting to
PR,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/264-1
00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:45.600
<v Josh Sparkes>whether you should proceed with them or
not, look at them. So they're CMG. OK. OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/264-2
00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.922
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. All right. Thank you.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/265-0
00:56:49.242 --> 00:56:52.994
<v Josh Sparkes>But yeah,
the same process draught submission go</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/265-1
00:56:52.994 --> 00:56:56.362
<v Josh Sparkes>through that, OK.
Is there any other times?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/266-0
00:56:58.202 --> 00:57:03.102
<v Josh Sparkes>Not for emotional.
So the historical awards submissions</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/266-1
00:57:03.102 --> 00:57:03.802
<v Josh Sparkes>support.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/267-0
00:57:05.522 --> 00:57:12.386
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that sort of historical we do take it
in the next to suggest as the historical</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/267-1
00:57:12.386 --> 00:57:17.240
<v Josh Sparkes>data is historical data.
So they ask us for like the same</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/267-2
00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:20.002
<v Josh Sparkes>information or part of what when.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/268-0
00:57:20.402 --> 00:57:26.621
<v Josh Sparkes>And is it again something that they could
do self-serve so award wins? Yes,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/268-1
00:57:26.621 --> 00:57:29.402
<v Josh Sparkes>because it's on for US award wins.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/269-0
00:57:31.602 --> 00:57:36.633
<v Josh Sparkes>And when they don't win, well, virtually,
it's not. They didn't win. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/269-1
00:57:36.633 --> 00:57:40.925
<v Josh Sparkes>So we but it happens.
So we track on the awards tracker and the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/269-2
00:57:40.925 --> 00:57:46.156
<v Josh Sparkes>outcome and there's that the support that
the other documents that you know I</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/269-3
00:57:46.156 --> 00:57:49.442
<v Josh Sparkes>managed where can they go to the awards
tracker.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/270-0
00:57:49.842 --> 00:57:49.962
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/271-0
00:57:51.242 --> 00:57:56.105
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't think so.
Sometimes we share the copy of. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/271-1
00:57:56.105 --> 00:58:02.184
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, but not the live link. Yeah. Yeah.
The dangerous the they miss.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/271-2
00:58:02.184 --> 00:58:08.002
<v Josh Sparkes>They can't use. OK. Yeah.
So these these might not be some of the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/272-0
00:58:08.882 --> 00:58:13.588
<v Josh Sparkes>Self-serve that you want them.
You think it's more about a copy? Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/272-1
00:58:13.588 --> 00:58:19.089
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think it's more about that they can
have visibility, just not editing, right.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/272-2
00:58:19.089 --> 00:58:23.596
<v Josh Sparkes>So it can have visibility.
So it's visibility and filtering but not</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/272-3
00:58:23.596 --> 00:58:24.722
<v Josh Sparkes>access to aid up.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/273-0
00:58:26.082 --> 00:58:26.322
<v Josh Sparkes>Umm.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/278-0
00:58:26.082 --> 00:58:29.639
<v Mark Sedge>Is there any?
Is there any benefit and if you get</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/278-1
00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:35.258
<v Mark Sedge>notified that say you win or something
that you create a knowledge article for</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/274-0
00:58:31.682 --> 00:58:31.802
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/275-0
00:58:33.202 --> 00:58:33.322
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/278-2
00:58:35.258 --> 00:58:40.877
<v Mark Sedge>just for that lasts for say six months
and then disappears to enable people to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/278-3
00:58:40.877 --> 00:58:45.642
<v Mark Sedge>self-serve for that information.
Is there any merit in doing that?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/276-0
00:58:44.242 --> 00:58:44.362
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/282-0
00:58:45.722 --> 00:58:49.026
<v Mark Sedge>So instead of,
instead of having to respond every time</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/277-0
00:58:46.442 --> 00:58:46.562
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/282-1
00:58:49.026 --> 00:58:53.651
<v Mark Sedge>someone says, how did we do on that?
You as soon as you get sort of notified</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/279-0
00:58:49.882 --> 00:58:50.002
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/282-2
00:58:53.651 --> 00:58:57.014
<v Mark Sedge>of an outcome,
you create an article and then it's time</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/282-3
00:58:57.014 --> 00:59:00.738
<v Mark Sedge>bound. So it retires.
You can basically create an article and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/282-4
00:59:00.738 --> 00:59:05.242
<v Mark Sedge>then retire that article after a certain
amount of time or even do a news.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/286-0
00:59:05.282 --> 00:59:09.104
<v Mark Sedge>News event maybe a news item.
It depends how open the audience is,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/281-0
00:59:05.682 --> 00:59:05.802
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/283-0
00:59:07.482 --> 00:59:07.602
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/286-1
00:59:09.104 --> 00:59:12.526
<v Mark Sedge>but there might be opportunities to do
something different.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/284-0
00:59:09.362 --> 00:59:09.482
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/285-0
00:59:10.362 --> 00:59:10.482
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/286-2
00:59:12.526 --> 00:59:14.122
<v Mark Sedge>What's the thinking on that?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/287-0
00:59:14.882 --> 00:59:19.035
<v Josh Sparkes>Well, there is the quotas,
which is the central point,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/287-1
00:59:19.035 --> 00:59:23.942
<v Josh Sparkes>I think for all of this information,
new directories and awards.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/287-2
00:59:23.942 --> 00:59:26.962
<v Josh Sparkes>So the award ones do set on there, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/290-0
00:59:28.282 --> 00:59:33.166
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's where they use and we'll use
that type of information for the links of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/290-1
00:59:33.166 --> 00:59:37.395
<v Josh Sparkes>capability statements for patches.
And I think that from a bad content</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/288-0
00:59:35.962 --> 00:59:36.402
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/290-2
00:59:37.395 --> 00:59:42.160
<v Josh Sparkes>perspective that's it's quite important
that we still will start there. I mean,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/289-0
00:59:40.882 --> 00:59:41.202
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/290-3
00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:46.985
<v Josh Sparkes>not adverse to putting it on service now,
but I think it's we can't take a wave,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/294-0
00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:49.104
<v Mark Sedge>No. So I no, I'm now now. I've sorry,
I misunderstood.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/290-4
00:59:46.985 --> 00:59:47.282
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/291-0
00:59:48.562 --> 00:59:49.042
<v Josh Sparkes>Quotes.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/294-1
00:59:49.104 --> 00:59:53.335
<v Mark Sedge>When I when you mentioned it before,
I wasn't sure that that had all of that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/294-2
00:59:53.335 --> 00:59:56.137
<v Mark Sedge>in there.
So what we need to do is have an article</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/294-3
00:59:56.137 --> 01:00:00.697
<v Mark Sedge>that just points people to how to get to
it and then and then literally if they if</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/292-0
00:59:56.762 --> 00:59:56.922
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/294-4
01:00:00.697 --> 01:00:04.762
<v Mark Sedge>through a general inquiry they asked for
it almost as they as they raise.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/293-0
01:00:03.522 --> 01:00:03.642
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/300-0
01:00:04.842 --> 01:00:08.413
<v Mark Sedge>That you you include in the sub you know
before they can submit it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/300-1
01:00:08.413 --> 01:00:12.613
<v Mark Sedge>You actually re point them at the right,
yeah. The right source. And then just,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/295-0
01:00:12.402 --> 01:00:12.682
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/300-2
01:00:12.613 --> 01:00:16.919
<v Mark Sedge>you know let that one lag and don't come
back to them because ultimately you want</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/296-0
01:00:15.122 --> 01:00:15.242
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/297-0
01:00:16.722 --> 01:00:16.842
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/300-3
01:00:16.919 --> 01:00:21.015
<v Mark Sedge>them or even just sending a notification
with the link in there to say here's</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/298-0
01:00:20.082 --> 01:00:20.202
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/300-4
01:00:21.015 --> 01:00:24.322
<v Mark Sedge>where you get your information.
One thanks very much and auto.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/299-0
01:00:23.642 --> 01:00:23.762
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/301-0
01:00:24.362 --> 01:00:27.162
<v Mark Sedge>Close the ticket.
You've got a number of options there.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/302-0
01:00:27.562 --> 01:00:30.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I think it's about if it relates to award</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/302-1
01:00:30.101 --> 01:00:33.855
<v Josh Sparkes>wins or you can probably put a
notification that says and directs them</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/302-2
01:00:33.855 --> 01:00:36.763
<v Josh Sparkes>to quarters in the content library.
And if it doesn't,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/302-3
01:00:36.763 --> 01:00:40.941
<v Josh Sparkes>then we'll obviously respond to you.
So I think there's similar to directories</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/302-4
01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:44.642
<v Josh Sparkes>for a cubicle one or two ways and those
instances where as available.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/304-0
01:00:44.722 --> 01:00:50.208
<v Josh Sparkes>Level please utilise itself server but
hasn't never pack up your request and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/303-0
01:00:49.322 --> 01:00:50.362
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/304-1
01:00:50.208 --> 01:00:55.124
<v Josh Sparkes>what other types of you know?
Also you're looking who won is always.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/304-2
01:00:55.124 --> 01:01:00.253
<v Josh Sparkes>Did I win? It's not personal.
It could be who won this over the last is</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/304-3
01:01:00.253 --> 01:01:04.242
<v Josh Sparkes>that happened three years or who was it's
not personal.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/305-0
01:01:04.522 --> 01:01:08.469
<v Josh Sparkes>It's if they want the data of the winning
the winning people,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/305-1
01:01:08.469 --> 01:01:13.306
<v Josh Sparkes>and just as a for my own invention,
you would categorise only they could go</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/305-2
01:01:13.306 --> 01:01:17.189
<v Josh Sparkes>and see externally the other law firms
that want it as well,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/305-3
01:01:17.189 --> 01:01:20.435
<v Josh Sparkes>because you may can do that their own
self survey.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/305-4
01:01:20.435 --> 01:01:23.362
<v Josh Sparkes>In that way we're just going to be
capturing.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/307-0
01:01:23.842 --> 01:01:27.381
<v Josh Sparkes>Ashurst winners within those time periods
in that category,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/307-1
01:01:27.381 --> 01:01:31.981
<v Josh Sparkes>you don't capture the the number one
person that won it. So that category no,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/307-2
01:01:31.981 --> 01:01:35.166
<v Josh Sparkes>not the, no,
you don't do the competitive side of it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/307-3
01:01:35.166 --> 01:01:36.522
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just the internal.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/308-0
01:01:40.002 --> 01:01:47.370
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good. So is that historical?
Is there any other targeting sort of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/308-1
01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:48.682
<v Josh Sparkes>shortlisting?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/309-0
01:01:51.202 --> 01:01:57.334
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that you get the shortlists? Yeah,
words. And then is then taken saying oh,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/309-1
01:01:57.334 --> 01:01:57.722
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/310-0
01:01:59.162 --> 01:02:06.595
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So following the Sebastian,
were they notified from the provider if</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/310-1
01:02:06.595 --> 01:02:11.717
<v Josh Sparkes>we're shortlisted on occasional tells us
with one,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/310-2
01:02:11.717 --> 01:02:17.642
<v Josh Sparkes>with an embargoed one at that point,
we then reach out to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/311-0
01:02:18.762 --> 01:02:22.804
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you you submitted it, it's great.
And then as you said,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/311-1
01:02:22.804 --> 01:02:27.759
<v Josh Sparkes>we've either been one or shortlisted and
it could be one or multiple people</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/311-2
01:02:27.759 --> 01:02:31.409
<v Josh Sparkes>multiple or category.
You know it's not just one to one</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/311-3
01:02:31.409 --> 01:02:35.842
<v Josh Sparkes>relationship or you're shortlisted in
this in these multiple areas.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/312-0
01:02:36.522 --> 01:02:43.042
<v Josh Sparkes>How do you get informed of that and
that's?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/313-0
01:02:44.442 --> 01:02:47.920
<v Josh Sparkes>And that just comes in. OK.
I was just thinking about how to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/313-1
01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.771
<v Josh Sparkes>systemize it. OK,
but I'll pop that for a minute.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/313-2
01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:55.332
<v Josh Sparkes>So they just tell you that breakdown.
You could then go into that case and then</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/313-3
01:02:55.332 --> 01:02:59.322
<v Josh Sparkes>what you do with that information at that
point? Yeah, we share with.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/314-0
01:03:00.842 --> 01:03:06.029
<v Josh Sparkes>PL And the CMG mode.
If we know about the the submissions,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/314-1
01:03:06.029 --> 01:03:11.128
<v Josh Sparkes>that was the CMG content for that
particular submissions,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/314-2
01:03:11.128 --> 01:03:16.402
<v Josh Sparkes>then we share the information with them
alongside with the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/315-0
01:03:17.322 --> 01:03:22.576
<v Josh Sparkes>Ticket booking packages.
So we've got the that information from</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/315-1
01:03:22.576 --> 01:03:29.142
<v Josh Sparkes>the provider saying the day and time and
place of the ceremony and how so yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/315-2
01:03:29.142 --> 01:03:33.082
<v Josh Sparkes>And the the ticket,
how much is the table cost?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/316-0
01:03:34.522 --> 01:03:39.422
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we'll ask whether any of you
would like to attend the ceremony. Yes.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/316-1
01:03:39.422 --> 01:03:42.249
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So CMG will reach out to the partners.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/316-2
01:03:42.249 --> 01:03:46.898
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes the partners will invite the
client to come along, right? Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/316-3
01:03:46.898 --> 01:03:50.730
<v Josh Sparkes>All plus ones that partner,
plus excel tickets or, you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/316-4
01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:53.242
<v Josh Sparkes>so you can have a whole table, 2 tables.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/317-0
01:03:53.282 --> 01:03:58.654
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, yeah. So do you.
What touches share world today to manage</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/317-1
01:03:58.654 --> 01:04:02.183
<v Josh Sparkes>that process?
I think it's more the about the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/317-2
01:04:02.183 --> 01:04:07.094
<v Josh Sparkes>communications. Yeah.
Sending out information and receiving the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/317-3
01:04:07.094 --> 01:04:13.002
<v Josh Sparkes>conversation from CMG or partners,
whether they want to, they want to go or.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/318-0
01:04:13.042 --> 01:04:17.111
<v Josh Sparkes>How many people?
How many tickets they would they would</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/318-1
01:04:17.111 --> 01:04:22.560
<v Josh Sparkes>like to to purchase? Yeah, approval.
That would be a subtask of that award</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/318-2
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.339
<v Josh Sparkes>submission.
That could be the one workflow and then</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/318-3
01:04:26.339 --> 01:04:31.642
<v Josh Sparkes>you can add you sort of track who's going
number of tickets where it is.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/319-0
01:04:32.442 --> 01:04:38.352
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's a tracking the details and the
comms that come out the back of that, yes,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/319-1
01:04:38.352 --> 01:04:43.973
<v Josh Sparkes>is it correct to assume that every time
you've won you'd go to the event, OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/319-2
01:04:43.973 --> 01:04:49.882
<v Josh Sparkes>it might be worth actually having it all
depends on whether they have the budget.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/320-0
01:04:50.202 --> 01:04:54.106
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
because the the practise the practise.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/320-1
01:04:54.106 --> 01:04:58.791
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, the practise.
So the the tickets they are quite</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/320-2
01:04:58.791 --> 01:05:05.211
<v Josh Sparkes>expensive so we need approval and the
Costco in order to proceed with the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/320-3
01:05:05.211 --> 01:05:09.722
<v Josh Sparkes>ticket booking.
So we will discuss we will be able.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/321-0
01:05:10.002 --> 01:05:13.256
<v Josh Sparkes>The award providers on the booking
harmony takers,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/321-1
01:05:13.256 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Josh Sparkes>but then the CMG and the partners,
they need to provide us with the proper</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/321-2
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.250
<v Josh Sparkes>approval for us to go okay.
That's where it comes in. But I mean,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/321-3
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:26.588
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, I mean my I'm jesting,
but winning every year might wear off.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/321-4
01:05:26.588 --> 01:05:29.522
<v Josh Sparkes>How much you know,
not going to go next year.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/322-0
01:05:29.602 --> 01:05:35.059
<v Josh Sparkes>But it's expected. If you've won you,
you tend to go for reputational</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/322-1
01:05:35.059 --> 01:05:39.425
<v Josh Sparkes>perspective. Yes,
that is as the directives. Yes. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/322-2
01:05:39.425 --> 01:05:45.661
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just not always discussed or someone
on behalf of might. Yeah. Instead of.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/322-3
01:05:45.661 --> 01:05:46.362
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/323-0
01:05:47.162 --> 01:05:52.127
<v Josh Sparkes>But that's certainly a workflow we could
manage. As you said, the events how many,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/323-1
01:05:52.127 --> 01:05:55.416
<v Josh Sparkes>where, when,
how many large codes and the approval for</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/323-2
01:05:55.416 --> 01:05:59.244
<v Josh Sparkes>them to attend. Yeah,
and that might lead to our business case.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/323-3
01:05:59.244 --> 01:06:04.029
<v Josh Sparkes>So whether we need the business case that
company is depending on the cost, OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/323-4
01:06:04.029 --> 01:06:06.242
<v Josh Sparkes>So the business case is triggered by.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/324-0
01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:11.489
<v Josh Sparkes>The threshold of the cost is there no
value for that 10,000.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/324-1
01:06:11.489 --> 01:06:17.625
<v Josh Sparkes>I've just got to write 10 and I've
written 10 and I didn't know how many</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/324-2
01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:20.482
<v Josh Sparkes>note. 10,000 is the business case.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/325-0
01:06:22.522 --> 01:06:28.004
<v Josh Sparkes>No, for the business case there's 1010,
including VAT.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/325-1
01:06:28.004 --> 01:06:32.488
<v Josh Sparkes>I've got it before 5 directors consider.
OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/325-2
01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:39.962
<v Josh Sparkes>who approves that goes to Chief B officer
and GBN, whatever her state was.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/326-0
01:06:40.442 --> 01:06:44.024
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry, Chief,
the media officer and the practise here</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/326-1
01:06:44.024 --> 01:06:48.468
<v Josh Sparkes>don't know this as well. OK,
so we can certainly do that workflow.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/326-2
01:06:48.468 --> 01:06:51.586
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
that goes end to end and Australia's the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/326-3
01:06:51.586 --> 01:06:54.969
<v Josh Sparkes>sort of equivalent value.
That's not enough. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/326-4
01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:58.882
<v Josh Sparkes>they're slightly differs as well
genuinely because of the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/327-0
01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:03.650
<v Josh Sparkes>The time and turn around.
Sometimes they have to use credit cards</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/327-1
01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:09.081
<v Josh Sparkes>to book the tickets and then expense that,
but it's only the approval for that. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/327-2
01:07:09.081 --> 01:07:12.302
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. I mean,
it's still the approval as this case</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/327-3
01:07:12.302 --> 01:07:15.522
<v Josh Sparkes>approval has over and yeah,
that's the case. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/328-0
01:07:16.162 --> 01:07:20.284
<v Josh Sparkes>Ideally it would be then an invoice and
going through the fuel process.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/328-1
01:07:20.284 --> 01:07:23.604
<v Josh Sparkes>OK so it could be a subtask of we've won
we're attending.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/328-2
01:07:23.604 --> 01:07:28.070
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean we've lost and we still want to
attend presumably what happens when we</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/328-3
01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:31.218
<v Josh Sparkes>don't lose,
but we'd still like to be there for, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/328-4
01:07:31.218 --> 01:07:35.282
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's like the client perspective as
well. So like sometimes you're.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/329-0
01:07:35.762 --> 01:07:39.183

You don't actually have that information,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/329-1
01:07:39.183 --> 01:07:43.357
<v Josh Sparkes>but generally speaking we get the
shortlist information and that's what</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/329-2
01:07:43.357 --> 01:07:47.416

01:07:47.416 --> 01:07:50.430
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes we're just told we have been
shortlisted,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/329-4
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:54.721
<v Josh Sparkes>but they are not going to announce the
winner until on the evening of the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/329-5
01:07:54.721 --> 01:07:55.242
<v Josh Sparkes>ceremony.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/330-0

<v Josh Sparkes>We've done the scheduled ones and we've
done the ad hoc ones and that workflow</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/331-2
01:08:16.943 --> 01:08:20.162

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/332-1
01:08:27.094 --> 01:08:31.122
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just APO process that we then follow.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/333-0
01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:38.481
<v Josh Sparkes>I said OK. Payment. Yeah,

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/333-1

<v Josh Sparkes>If you think about that instead of it
going into outlook,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/336-1

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/338-0
01:09:47.242 --> 01:09:53.309
<v Josh Sparkes>In it's in terms of pretty much high
level, you know end to end process, yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/338-1
01:09:53.309 --> 01:09:59.067

you're going pick up the awards.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/338-2
01:09:59.067 --> 01:10:04.442
<v Josh Sparkes>There's some of that we need to pay press
release as well but that's.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/339-0
01:10:05.602 --> 01:10:09.112
<v Josh Sparkes>PR was, yeah, so PR would let us know.
Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/339-1
01:10:09.112 --> 01:10:15.350
<v Josh Sparkes>If they want to put out a press release.
But it's not something that we trigger</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/339-2
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:21.042
<v Josh Sparkes>some awards we need to bring to pay entry
fee to enter. Yeah, basically.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/341-0
01:10:21.762 --> 01:10:25.202
<v Josh Sparkes>But that's done at the draught submission
stage, OK?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/342-0
01:10:27.202 --> 01:10:27.322
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/343-0
01:10:28.322 --> 01:10:33.320
<v Josh Sparkes>They're always suspicious.
Those paid to end to one and everyone</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/343-1
01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:37.317
<v Josh Sparkes>always gets advised. I mean,
not being courage. OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/343-2
01:10:37.317 --> 01:10:39.162
<v Josh Sparkes>and press release comes.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/344-0
01:10:40.602 --> 01:10:47.693
<v Josh Sparkes>Free. We're attending or they always post.
We want that thing. Yes, yes, yeah. After.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/344-1
01:10:47.693 --> 01:10:51.568
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Yeah.
After the result has been officially</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/344-2
01:10:51.568 --> 01:10:55.442
<v Josh Sparkes>announced. Yeah,
because that could trigger a.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/345-0
01:10:56.122 --> 01:11:00.025
<v Josh Sparkes>Notification for the details,
at least the we want this in this</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/345-1
01:11:00.025 --> 01:11:03.013
<v Josh Sparkes>category.
You got the information there that you</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/345-2
01:11:03.013 --> 01:11:08.136
<v Josh Sparkes>could be triggered to populate that press
release. Yeah. But we are not populating.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/345-3
01:11:08.136 --> 01:11:12.282
<v Josh Sparkes>We usually if if they want to put up a
press release we've got the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/346-0
01:11:13.522 --> 01:11:17.990
<v Josh Sparkes>Got the information from PR and then they
would let us know to like put it on the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/346-1
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:21.259
<v Josh Sparkes>Azure's website,
but sometimes they do it themselves. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/346-2
01:11:21.259 --> 01:11:24.310
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah. So the past release,
those on texture themselves,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/346-3
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:26.162
<v Josh Sparkes>they have access to do them, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/348-0
01:11:28.602 --> 01:11:35.562
<v Josh Sparkes>A break. So I just need to stand up.
Should we come back four? Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/349-0
01:11:50.162 --> 01:11:59.482
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/350-0
01:12:06.402 --> 01:12:13.119
<v Josh Sparkes>Obviously I messed up in the complex.
Some of them are like, you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/350-1
01:12:13.119 --> 01:12:20.402
<v Josh Sparkes>put the same challenge. But yeah,
that would finally service here, you know.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/351-0
01:12:21.842 --> 01:12:27.205
<v Josh Sparkes>Just otherwise you get into the weeks of
the science or something like cashieri.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/351-1
01:12:27.205 --> 01:12:32.369
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, there's no way that we could learn,
you know, like going to the doctor.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/351-2
01:12:32.369 --> 01:12:37.335
<v Josh Sparkes>I can't be almost years of training.
We just have to be what you do today.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/351-3
01:12:37.335 --> 01:12:41.042
<v Josh Sparkes>Workflow. Yeah.
But once you think like that otherwise.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/352-0
01:12:41.962 --> 01:12:42.602
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/353-0
01:12:49.362 --> 01:12:57.870
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm thinking it's a process if you're
trying to make it a very consistent look</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/353-1
01:12:57.870 --> 01:13:01.962
<v Josh Sparkes>and feel when you stay with, you know.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/354-0
01:13:10.682 --> 01:13:14.001
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I think it lasts a little bit longer than</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/354-1
01:13:14.001 --> 01:13:15.522
<v Josh Sparkes>what we expected, but.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/355-0
01:13:16.722 --> 01:13:22.083
<v Josh Sparkes>Time like and the calendars anyway,
so we may as well. So yeah, exactly.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/355-1
01:13:22.083 --> 01:13:26.122
<v Josh Sparkes>So it was good.
I think Marwan got everything that you</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/355-2
01:13:26.122 --> 01:13:31.482
<v Josh Sparkes>needed, stuff like that. So yeah,
finished it. Do you think I came down?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/356-0
01:13:33.642 --> 01:13:37.229
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah, it was a good one.
You still be on the countdown now,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/356-1
01:13:37.229 --> 01:13:39.848
<v Josh Sparkes>so you are.
So you only got the rest of that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/356-2
01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:42.922
<v Josh Sparkes>This is more.
This is it's a bit like having surgery,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/356-3
01:13:42.922 --> 01:13:45.768
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, it's goat.
And then when you finish it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/356-4
01:13:45.768 --> 01:13:50.322
<v Josh Sparkes>they goat and now it starts and the start
how it feels like now this is just a.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/357-0

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/357-1

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/357-2

<v Josh Sparkes>I think I'm going on Thursday if nobody
sure might be in.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/357-3
01:14:02.775 --> 01:14:07.799
<v Josh Sparkes>Then if you aren't going to be here then
we will definitely go in on Wednesday.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/357-4
01:14:07.799 --> 01:14:10.562

<v Josh Sparkes>Because I just thought.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/361-0

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/362-2
01:15:24.581 --> 01:15:28.119
<v Josh Sparkes>T shapers. Well,
it's because I haven't shared it because</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/362-3

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:31.332
<v Josh Sparkes>And when it comes back to terrible
important,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/402-1
01:22:31.332 --> 01:22:38.979
<v Josh Sparkes>you get for me as the statement another
one and so been able to play that back to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/402-2
01:22:38.979 --> 01:22:43.362

01:22:57.197 --> 01:23:02.602
<v Josh Sparkes>actually in reality this.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/404-0
01:23:04.802 --> 01:23:07.962
<v Josh Sparkes>The same thing, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/405-0
01:23:24.322 --> 01:23:29.635
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah. You know, it's great.
It's a really nice tool to use. Yeah.</v>

01:23:29.635 --> 01:23:35.317
<v Josh Sparkes>And hopefully that's being related to.
Yeah, I think that 'd be a good idea.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/405-2
01:23:35.317 --> 01:23:40.334
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just happy to make the impact of the
parent, but I think, yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/405-3
01:23:40.334 --> 01:23:43.802
<v Josh Sparkes>challenge though, like that. Yeah,
that's one.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/406-0
01:23:53.082 --> 01:23:56.602
<v Josh Sparkes>So those have loads of like yellow in the
which are like the worst.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/407-0
01:24:04.922 --> 01:24:12.722
<v Josh Sparkes>That doesn't mean you can have.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/408-0
01:24:21.202 --> 01:24:30.527

<v Josh Sparkes>The main loop we're getting the person
that posted to the point that we can tell</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/409-1

<v Josh Sparkes>me.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/410-0
01:24:52.682 --> 01:24:52.802
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/411-0

<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/413-0

<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/414-0
01:24:59.162 --> 01:25:06.973
<v Josh Sparkes>Would love to get finished by 5,
but dry so it's not harder one you said,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/414-1
01:25:06.973 --> 01:25:11.722
<v Josh Sparkes>right? Yeah. Well, it's not hard.
It's just.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/415-0
01:25:13.722 --> 01:25:16.290
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
that process is not hard and it's just</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/415-1
01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:20.798
<v Josh Sparkes>the. But I have the back and forth.
There's quite a few things going on there.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/415-2
01:25:20.798 --> 01:25:24.849
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it's it's all the back and forth,

01:25:24.849 --> 01:25:29.242
<v Josh Sparkes>but the child and all the different
associations that they can just revisit.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/416-0
01:25:32.442 --> 01:25:37.490
<v Josh Sparkes>Tickets flying out. Would you just take?
I think I've got it written down. Well,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/416-1
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:41.602
<v Josh Sparkes>if you told me where or what it was that
I need specificity here.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/417-0
01:25:45.842 --> 01:25:46.442

01:26:03.472 --> 01:26:10.082
<v Josh Sparkes>Why did I go to the loo for two minutes?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/421-0
01:26:13.682 --> 01:26:15.138
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you know roughly at what time it was
said?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/421-1
01:26:15.138 --> 01:26:16.562
<v Josh Sparkes>I can just listen to the recording
actually.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/422-0
01:26:19.202 --> 01:26:23.562
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got various notes about CMG doing
things like.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/423-0
01:26:27.882 --> 01:26:28.762
<v Josh Sparkes>I never look at the thing.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/424-0
01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:41.116
<v Josh Sparkes>I can't remember which of them is the
behaviour change is the thing Emily</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/424-1
01:26:41.116 --> 01:26:47.629
<v Josh Sparkes>basically a pop to the loo and Josh
forgot what the change aspect?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/424-2
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:51.322
<v Josh Sparkes>I've got it. I've got it on the thing.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/427-0
01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:55.059
<v Mark Sedge>It IT related it related to self help.
It was the bit where we said they could</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/425-0
01:26:52.162 --> 01:26:52.242
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/427-1
01:26:55.059 --> 01:26:59.496
<v Mark Sedge>go and look for it but they don't.
They ask and they asked so you know</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/426-0
01:26:57.522 --> 01:26:59.162
<v Josh Sparkes>Don't put the what, sorry.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/427-2
01:26:59.496 --> 01:27:04.433
<v Mark Sedge>obviously that takes a drawer out of
these guys time and you know what we want</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/427-3
01:27:04.433 --> 01:27:08.682
<v Mark Sedge>them to be able to do is be steered
towards a knowledge article or.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/428-0
01:27:09.362 --> 01:27:09.562
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/430-0
01:27:09.842 --> 01:27:14.473
<v Mark Sedge>The team talked about not necessarily
responding as quickly to those ones,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/430-1
01:27:14.473 --> 01:27:18.362
<v Mark Sedge>so that it helps them get it quicker if
they do it themselves.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/431-0
01:27:18.962 --> 01:27:22.682
<v Josh Sparkes>You have to do with the store
confirmation for work one and.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/432-0
01:27:24.842 --> 01:27:27.122
<v Mark Sedge>Did I get that right, Emily? Sorry,
I can't hear you.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/434-0
01:27:26.642 --> 01:27:36.287
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, the historical,
the award wins tracker that's unquoted.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/434-1
01:27:36.287 --> 01:27:42.042
<v Josh Sparkes>So to point to the self-serve option.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/433-0
01:27:40.562 --> 01:27:41.762
<v Mark Sedge>There we go. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/436-0
01:27:43.082 --> 01:27:47.741
<v Josh Sparkes>For the for the ones for the
transcriptions and the directories,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/436-1
01:27:47.741 --> 01:27:52.184
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not actually also the tracker that we
were talking about,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/435-0
01:27:51.642 --> 01:27:52.042
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/436-2
01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:55.982
<v Josh Sparkes>potentially making the directories and
awards. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/436-3
01:27:55.982 --> 01:27:58.562
<v Josh Sparkes>we were talking about it over there.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/438-0
01:28:03.282 --> 01:28:08.047
<v Josh Sparkes>So the that's the tracker that tracks
each of those being directories or words,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/438-1
01:28:08.047 --> 01:28:12.336
<v Josh Sparkes>and it's more about visibility,
but not being able to aid it or philtre</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/438-2
01:28:12.336 --> 01:28:14.122
<v Josh Sparkes>philtre. Can you put the next?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/437-0
01:28:13.002 --> 01:28:13.202
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/439-0
01:28:14.802 --> 01:28:22.827
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. And we want all of that on chorus.
We're currently on chorus, OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/439-1
01:28:22.827 --> 01:28:27.842
<v Josh Sparkes>the award wins is on Chorus and the
summary.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/440-0
01:28:29.722 --> 01:28:43.682
<v Josh Sparkes>And the rankings so many social media
stuff, I think we got those we.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/441-0
01:28:47.682 --> 01:28:47.962
<v Josh Sparkes>Find.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/442-0
01:28:51.122 --> 01:28:53.002
<v Josh Sparkes>Sun, are they going to be?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/443-0
01:28:56.242 --> 01:28:56.402
<v Josh Sparkes>She.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/444-0
01:29:03.202 --> 01:29:03.362
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/445-0
01:29:06.282 --> 01:29:06.402
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/446-0
01:29:10.082 --> 01:29:14.636
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, so there's this PR activity.
There's not all of them are PR,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/446-1
01:29:14.636 --> 01:29:17.788
<v Josh Sparkes>but you've got PR client data and
reporting.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/446-2
01:29:17.788 --> 01:29:23.322
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe that actually is reporting that
next one down. Sorry, I've got that one.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/447-0
01:29:23.882 --> 01:29:28.387
<v Josh Sparkes>But that should go on to reporting
correct type of data,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/447-1
01:29:28.387 --> 01:29:32.100
<v Josh Sparkes>reporting distribution, list management,
yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/447-2
01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:37.869
<v Josh Sparkes>just make that there's one I think so no,
that's not that like reporting</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/447-3
01:29:37.869 --> 01:29:40.002
<v Josh Sparkes>applications distributions.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/449-0
01:29:40.962 --> 01:29:44.067
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
Publication distribution to do with the,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/449-1
01:29:44.067 --> 01:29:48.828
<v Josh Sparkes>that's why we've got a more content
calendar. So you do the top one,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/449-2
01:29:48.828 --> 01:29:52.416
<v Josh Sparkes>the social media one,
that's probably a good place.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/449-3
01:29:52.416 --> 01:29:56.762
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's the point. If you could see,
that's just the levers.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/450-0
01:29:59.042 --> 01:30:02.839
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. If we start that,
so is that you say it's to do with leave</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/450-1
01:30:02.839 --> 01:30:06.755
<v Josh Sparkes>this. Yeah, pretty much.
This is just an admin removal of access</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/450-2
01:30:06.755 --> 01:30:10.973
<v Josh Sparkes>to anyone that's left the firm.
Do you do that or is that part of the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/450-3
01:30:10.973 --> 01:30:13.202
<v Josh Sparkes>join and move and leave this process?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/451-0
01:30:14.642 --> 01:30:17.193
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
I think we're taking it as a wider</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/451-1
01:30:17.193 --> 01:30:22.294
<v Josh Sparkes>subject because we did a child the week
before and probably he would say actually</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/451-2
01:30:22.294 --> 01:30:27.270
<v Josh Sparkes>as part of a triggering that all access
for all things are removed based on the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/451-3
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:31.002
<v Josh Sparkes>readers report. So you could roll that up.
Yeah, into that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/452-0
01:30:31.482 --> 01:30:35.464
<v Josh Sparkes>Add that as a removal. Yeah.
Another platform. Yes, people need to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/452-1
01:30:35.464 --> 01:30:38.099
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So if they're in the AG directory that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/452-2
01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:41.671
<v Josh Sparkes>it's all removed across all their access
for anything. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/452-3
01:30:41.671 --> 01:30:45.302
<v Josh Sparkes>They can't actually access it when they
leave or. Yeah. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/452-4
01:30:45.302 --> 01:30:48.522
<v Josh Sparkes>as a if it's removed. Yes.
It's associated with their.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/453-0
01:30:49.162 --> 01:30:53.260
<v Josh Sparkes>For an e-mail, yeah.
But it would make sense as part of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/453-1
01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:56.553
<v Josh Sparkes>enjoying readers. Readers process. Yeah,
no,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/453-2
01:30:56.553 --> 01:31:02.260
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it makes sense to remove access
as part of. Yeah, that, that process,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/453-3
01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:07.162
<v Josh Sparkes>it would just guess the question would be
as IT have an access to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/454-0
01:31:08.242 --> 01:31:11.356
<v Josh Sparkes>Remove that so that we just need to be
shared. OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/454-1
01:31:11.356 --> 01:31:15.202
<v Josh Sparkes>this is not a team managed platform.
It's a external platform.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/456-0
01:31:15.162 --> 01:31:18.842
<v Mark Sedge>But there could be an opportunity.
Why would they not have access?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/455-0
01:31:17.242 --> 01:31:17.562
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/458-0
01:31:20.482 --> 01:31:25.231
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just because it's a. Yeah, well,
I think this one's actually social media.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/458-1
01:31:25.231 --> 01:31:28.912
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a social media platform.
It's a external platform. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/458-2
01:31:28.912 --> 01:31:29.802
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it multiple?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/461-0
01:31:29.882 --> 01:31:34.322
<v Mark Sedge>But we could still generate a task for
that team to go action. Can we?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/459-0
01:31:29.922 --> 01:31:30.122
<v Josh Sparkes>Just.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/460-0
01:31:32.562 --> 01:31:32.842
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/462-0
01:31:34.802 --> 01:31:39.140
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So on the leave,
the support for social media is this from</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/462-1
01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:43.744
<v Josh Sparkes>something. So basically, Mark,
this is the one that when they leave,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/462-2
01:31:43.744 --> 01:31:49.082
<v Josh Sparkes>they're being removed from these social
media, external platforms, right? Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/464-0
01:31:48.642 --> 01:31:53.947
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So, So what I what? Yeah. What?
I was this what I was trying to work out</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/464-1
01:31:53.947 --> 01:31:58.983
<v Mark Sedge>that if it's not if it's not currently
sort of within the gift of it to do</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/464-2
01:31:58.983 --> 01:32:03.482
<v Mark Sedge>anything with it then whichever team does
manage the admin access.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/463-0
01:32:00.482 --> 01:32:00.602
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/466-0
01:32:03.882 --> 01:32:06.796
<v Mark Sedge>We should out of the join as movers,
leave us.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/466-1
01:32:06.796 --> 01:32:11.756
<v Mark Sedge>Just give them a task or notification
task that they can they action as part of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/467-0
01:32:10.202 --> 01:32:15.422
<v Josh Sparkes>Which is what which which is then us,
which is then you. Is that. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/466-2
01:32:11.756 --> 01:32:12.562
<v Mark Sedge>that process.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/467-1
01:32:15.422 --> 01:32:20.776
<v Josh Sparkes>So you're saying as weird then the that
point that not a lot of people use this</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/467-2
01:32:20.776 --> 01:32:24.122
<v Josh Sparkes>so it's not in fact just it should be
with every.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/469-0
01:32:25.122 --> 01:32:29.612
<v Josh Sparkes>Should be like every quarter,
but it's as and when they have the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/469-1
01:32:29.612 --> 01:32:34.033
<v Josh Sparkes>capacity to review it,
but it's not widely used because they're</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/469-2
01:32:34.033 --> 01:32:37.349
<v Josh Sparkes>trying,
I think trying to replace the platform.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/469-3
01:32:37.349 --> 01:32:42.322
<v Josh Sparkes>So do you manage those people that are on
those social media platforms?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/470-0
01:32:42.802 --> 01:32:49.393
<v Josh Sparkes>On anywhere only for the lever when you
add them do you manage them anywhere,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/470-1
01:32:49.393 --> 01:32:51.082
<v Josh Sparkes>we just remove them.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/471-0
01:32:51.642 --> 01:32:54.684
<v Mark Sedge>Yes,
so so my mind source says that whoever it</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/471-1
01:32:54.684 --> 01:32:57.402
<v Mark Sedge>is that does the ads should do the remove.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/472-0
01:32:56.242 --> 01:32:59.133
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, it's it's a self-serve I believe.
Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/472-1
01:32:59.133 --> 01:33:04.401
<v Josh Sparkes>We need to remove them because they're
leaving. Yeah. Yeah. And then have access.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/472-2
01:33:04.401 --> 01:33:08.962
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. But it's something certainly. I mean,
you're not getting multiple.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/472-3
01:33:08.962 --> 01:33:13.522
<v Josh Sparkes>How many people are on these platforms?
There's it's so historic that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/473-0
01:33:14.402 --> 01:33:17.664
<v Josh Sparkes>It's hardly the base left on it,
but to be removed, OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/473-1
01:33:17.664 --> 01:33:21.217
<v Josh Sparkes>And they are themselves.
They're trying to replace that with</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/473-2
01:33:21.217 --> 01:33:25.062
<v Josh Sparkes>something else. They're just trying to.
So as we move people off,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/473-3
01:33:25.062 --> 01:33:27.974
<v Josh Sparkes>we're not adding new people on those.
Not really.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/473-4
01:33:27.974 --> 01:33:32.692
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we're not advertising it or not.
So it sounds like it's good to join the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/473-5
01:33:32.692 --> 01:33:33.682
<v Josh Sparkes>group as leavers.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/474-0
01:33:33.802 --> 01:33:37.334
<v Josh Sparkes>And you get a task that this person is
leaving. I mean,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/474-1
01:33:37.334 --> 01:33:42.317
<v Josh Sparkes>are there particular so we are there a
particular group that leaves that you I</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/474-2
01:33:42.317 --> 01:33:47.363
<v Josh Sparkes>mean how how would the joiner move the
leaders we would use the leaders report.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/474-3
01:33:47.363 --> 01:33:49.002
<v Josh Sparkes>Are you getting a copy of?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/475-0
01:33:49.922 --> 01:33:55.805
<v Josh Sparkes>The leavers at joiners and Leavers report,
and that's then what we use to inform who</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/475-1
01:33:55.805 --> 01:33:59.334
<v Josh Sparkes>is removed.
And so how would you know that they've</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/475-2
01:33:59.334 --> 01:34:04.732
<v Josh Sparkes>been added to a platform based on Circuit
says therefore, how Josh, you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/475-3
01:34:04.732 --> 01:34:05.562
<v Josh Sparkes>it would be.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/476-0
01:34:06.362 --> 01:34:09.039
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
how would you know that if I was on it</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/476-1
01:34:09.039 --> 01:34:12.261
<v Josh Sparkes>and Josh wasn't?
How would you know who's on that platform</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/476-2
01:34:12.261 --> 01:34:15.921
<v Josh Sparkes>a lot? Or you just check?
You just go into the platform and check,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/476-3
01:34:15.921 --> 01:34:19.689
<v Josh Sparkes>check if they're on it. OK.
It's as random as as random as that. OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/476-4
01:34:19.689 --> 01:34:22.202
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
There's something we can take away to see</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/476-5
01:34:22.202 --> 01:34:22.802
<v Josh Sparkes>how we can.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/478-0
01:34:24.042 --> 01:34:28.223
<v Josh Sparkes>But that it could be when access is I'm
not suggest and there's only something</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/478-1
01:34:28.223 --> 01:34:32.456
<v Josh Sparkes>you can do because you're admin of that
type of admin and so does social media.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/478-2
01:34:32.456 --> 01:34:36.161
<v Josh Sparkes>And I wonder if Mark that's an
opportunity that IT when they're doing</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/478-3
01:34:36.161 --> 01:34:40.182
<v Josh Sparkes>these things they also have admin,
you know it's not that it's something to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/478-4
01:34:40.182 --> 01:34:42.722
<v Josh Sparkes>discuss that it's like a scheduled case
really.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/477-0
01:34:40.882 --> 01:34:41.642
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, 'cause it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/479-0
01:34:41.842 --> 01:34:41.962
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/480-0
01:34:43.242 --> 01:34:48.405
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what goods it's like.
A trigger of this needs to happen. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/480-1
01:34:48.405 --> 01:34:53.125
<v Josh Sparkes>as a result of the Weaver, it is what?
That's what we do. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/483-0
01:34:51.242 --> 01:34:55.876
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So what? What? What I was thinking.
So, Emily, what? Yes,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/480-2
01:34:53.125 --> 01:34:55.042
<v Josh Sparkes>we'd send the task to you.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/483-1
01:34:55.876 --> 01:34:59.786
<v Mark Sedge>it'll auto trigger a task out of the
leavers process.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/483-2
01:34:59.786 --> 01:35:04.854
<v Mark Sedge>But what we could do is say, well,
if service desk are removing safe,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/481-0
01:35:04.002 --> 01:35:04.122
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/483-3
01:35:04.854 --> 01:35:09.922
<v Mark Sedge>the person from AD and all of these other
things, if they had access.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/482-0
01:35:05.322 --> 01:35:05.442
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/484-0
01:35:10.162 --> 01:35:13.854
<v Mark Sedge>Credentials.
They could do that on your behalf as part</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/486-0
01:35:13.402 --> 01:35:24.362
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I don't know.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/484-1
01:35:13.854 --> 01:35:16.002
<v Mark Sedge>of the one removal sweep, right?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/485-0
01:35:18.362 --> 01:35:21.322
<v Mark Sedge>So that should be something we can ask
the question.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/487-0
01:35:27.202 --> 01:35:31.138
<v Josh Sparkes>Let me have a look at the other support.
Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/487-1
01:35:31.138 --> 01:35:34.906
<v Josh Sparkes>George can do the client client
publication,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/487-2
01:35:34.906 --> 01:35:41.857
<v Josh Sparkes>do the client publications as long as the
two at the bottom publications and media</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/487-3
01:35:41.857 --> 01:35:45.122
<v Josh Sparkes>release publications and media release.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/488-0
01:35:45.642 --> 01:35:47.682
<v Josh Sparkes>Right. So we've done hot words.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/489-0
01:35:49.282 --> 01:35:52.400
<v Josh Sparkes>Because that was the whole content
calendar.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/489-1
01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:58.151
<v Josh Sparkes>That's when we spoke about the start, OK,
but and then we got the distribution and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/489-2
01:35:58.151 --> 01:36:01.823
<v Josh Sparkes>the distribution comes as part of that
same process.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/489-3
01:36:01.823 --> 01:36:07.020
<v Josh Sparkes>So we're not by what they select,
whether it's an interaction, less board,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/489-4
01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:08.682
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, or a distribution.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/490-0
01:36:10.162 --> 01:36:17.648
<v Josh Sparkes>They can ask for an interaction list in
preparation for that separately to the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/490-1
01:36:17.648 --> 01:36:19.922
<v Josh Sparkes>global content calendar.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/491-0
01:36:21.402 --> 01:36:26.684
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just trying to think if there's any
other instances of a distribution or not.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/491-1
01:36:26.684 --> 01:36:31.192
<v Josh Sparkes>Otherwise it will go through that
calendar. Do we have anything else?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/491-2
01:36:31.192 --> 01:36:34.541
<v Josh Sparkes>If that distribution does not involve
publications,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/491-3
01:36:34.541 --> 01:36:39.242
<v Josh Sparkes>then it won't show up on the GCC.
It is just a set of distribution only.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/492-0
01:36:40.122 --> 01:36:40.602
<v Josh Sparkes>How old is?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/493-0
01:36:44.322 --> 01:36:48.894
<v Josh Sparkes>Loads are loads,
I'm just actually I'm trying that AI1</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/493-1
01:36:48.894 --> 01:36:49.642
<v Josh Sparkes>requests.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/494-0
01:36:50.922 --> 01:36:55.069
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
usually the distribution is attached to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/494-1
01:36:55.069 --> 01:37:01.199
<v Josh Sparkes>publications. Yeah, yeah.
But if they decided to just go ahead with</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/494-2
01:37:01.199 --> 01:37:07.238
<v Josh Sparkes>distribution and not involving anything,
upload to to the website,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/494-3
01:37:07.238 --> 01:37:09.762
<v Josh Sparkes>then they don't need to add.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/495-0
01:37:10.442 --> 01:37:16.344
<v Josh Sparkes>And an entry on GCC they can just submit
what we're supposed to work directly.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/495-1
01:37:16.344 --> 01:37:19.632
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
distribution sharing interaction with</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/495-2
01:37:19.632 --> 01:37:23.591
<v Josh Sparkes>this. So is that the interaction list?
You get that?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/495-3
01:37:23.591 --> 01:37:29.642
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's been an additional task as part
of that. So there's like a few things.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/496-0
01:37:29.762 --> 01:37:34.098
<v Josh Sparkes>Associated with a publication. Yeah,
that they can pack from being an IE</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/496-1
01:37:34.098 --> 01:37:36.950
<v Josh Sparkes>interaction list and upload under
distribution,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/496-2
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:41.880
<v Josh Sparkes>OK and they can pack from those three. OK,
so we can incorporate it at that point,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/496-3
01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:45.146
<v Josh Sparkes>could we for those that have an upload to
the website,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/496-4
01:37:45.146 --> 01:37:49.482
<v Josh Sparkes>so those that don't have an upload to the
website, it's off through the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/497-0
01:37:49.642 --> 01:37:52.122
<v Josh Sparkes>Form distribution and.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/498-0
01:37:55.642 --> 01:37:56.282
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's good.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/499-0
01:38:00.002 --> 01:38:06.667
<v Josh Sparkes>If we look at clients,
other supports PowerPoint formatting that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/499-1
01:38:06.667 --> 01:38:08.922
<v Josh Sparkes>comes in as a general.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/500-0
01:38:10.322 --> 01:38:16.272
<v Josh Sparkes>Query. How does that land do today? Yeah,
the ad hoc form. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/500-1
01:38:16.272 --> 01:38:23.138
<v Josh Sparkes>J is client presentations, right?
So there's probably a review of it comes</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/500-2
01:38:23.138 --> 01:38:24.602
<v Josh Sparkes>in via the form.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/501-0
01:38:25.522 --> 01:38:30.987
<v Josh Sparkes>Selection of PowerPoint or via e-mail.
At that stage they tell us to you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/501-1
01:38:30.987 --> 01:38:35.068
<v Josh Sparkes>how much of a checklist of that what you
asking today? No,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/501-2
01:38:35.068 --> 01:38:38.596
<v Josh Sparkes>they're quite is based on what they're
asking for.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/501-3
01:38:38.596 --> 01:38:41.362
<v Josh Sparkes>So it can come in different formats all.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/502-0
01:38:41.842 --> 01:38:46.534
<v Josh Sparkes>Just rebrand so it could be an old brand
to new brands. OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/502-1
01:38:46.534 --> 01:38:52.555
<v Josh Sparkes>we brand new brands that would make,
we would then push that to the document</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/502-2
01:38:52.555 --> 01:38:56.152
<v Josh Sparkes>production team.
If it's a straight transfer,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/502-3
01:38:56.152 --> 01:39:00.922
<v Josh Sparkes>if it's a case of can you chance of this
one can you change?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/503-0
01:39:01.802 --> 01:39:05.488
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you brand the line?
Can you make this more stiff,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/503-1
01:39:05.488 --> 01:39:10.880
<v Josh Sparkes>enhance or align with the align with the
guidelines like that all of that then</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/503-2
01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:15.385
<v Josh Sparkes>would stick with us. OK,
so you capture that upfront that if it's</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/503-3
01:39:15.385 --> 01:39:19.002
<v Josh Sparkes>brand rebrands,
if you're a good thing going off to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/504-0
01:39:19.482 --> 01:39:27.169
<v Josh Sparkes>Document which will document production,
production and then if it's the others.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/504-1
01:39:27.169 --> 01:39:33.433
<v Josh Sparkes>As you said, change. Yeah,
it's for like reformatting performance</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/504-2
01:39:33.433 --> 01:39:37.799
<v Josh Sparkes>imagery,
that kind of stuff that would be us,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/504-3
01:39:37.799 --> 01:39:38.842
<v Josh Sparkes>we will be.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/505-0
01:39:39.042 --> 01:39:44.032
<v Josh Sparkes>Thinking at whether that is client facing
or if that's an internal document.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/505-1
01:39:44.032 --> 01:39:48.957
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's an internal document that's also
for either themselves to do or for</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/505-2
01:39:48.957 --> 01:39:53.104
<v Josh Sparkes>document production. OK,
so you're doing the so essentially the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/505-3
01:39:53.104 --> 01:39:58.482
<v Josh Sparkes>stuff that knowledge article upfront when
you're leading the stuff that land land.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/506-0
01:39:58.562 --> 01:40:04.911
<v Josh Sparkes>With yourself is the reformatting your
client presentations? Yeah. OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/506-1
01:40:04.911 --> 01:40:09.471
<v Josh Sparkes>so they're the rules that land with
yourself. Yes.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/506-2
01:40:09.471 --> 01:40:16.981
<v Josh Sparkes>Providing support on client documentation.
But we also need to have what if there's</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/506-3
01:40:16.981 --> 01:40:18.322
<v Josh Sparkes>client imagery?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/507-0
01:40:19.562 --> 01:40:23.245
<v Josh Sparkes>Or it goes to use.
We need confirmation from the client to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/507-1
01:40:23.245 --> 01:40:26.678
<v Josh Sparkes>use that or from compliance if they find
that upfront,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/507-2
01:40:26.678 --> 01:40:31.234
<v Josh Sparkes>do they tend to show they don't?
They chose to steal the information and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/507-3
01:40:31.234 --> 01:40:35.728
<v Josh Sparkes>give it to us and ask us to it.
So that's why we compliance perspective</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/507-4
01:40:35.728 --> 01:40:38.162
<v Josh Sparkes>to go. You need to go and get approval.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/508-0
01:40:38.322 --> 01:40:41.576
<v Josh Sparkes>Before we'll work on that,
but maybe that should be an opportunity</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/508-1
01:40:41.576 --> 01:40:44.927
<v Josh Sparkes>where you could say actually we're only
accepting the fact you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/508-2
01:40:44.927 --> 01:40:48.375
<v Josh Sparkes>we're not just going to put,
I worked in the case with Warner Brothers</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/508-3
01:40:48.375 --> 01:40:52.503
<v Josh Sparkes>where they took all their super, you know,
they took all the imagery and then it was</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/508-4
01:40:52.503 --> 01:40:53.522
<v Josh Sparkes>posted and there was.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/509-0
01:40:53.762 --> 01:40:56.441
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
imagine the backlash so it could be that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/509-1
01:40:56.441 --> 01:40:59.855
<v Josh Sparkes>the pre approval check is that they've
already got confirmation,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/509-2
01:40:59.855 --> 01:41:02.166
<v Josh Sparkes>so it it stops that back and forth
already.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/509-3
01:41:02.166 --> 01:41:05.002
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's an opportunity there where we
can get that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/510-0
01:41:04.962 --> 01:41:08.943
<v Mark Sedge>Would you would you want that attached?
Would you want that attached Emily to the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/510-1
01:41:08.943 --> 01:41:09.282
<v Mark Sedge>record?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/512-0
01:41:09.682 --> 01:41:15.282
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, no. Yeah, definitely not just folks.
Yes, you will support.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/511-0
01:41:11.842 --> 01:41:12.082
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/515-0
01:41:14.482 --> 01:41:17.035
<v Mark Sedge>Well then,
and that's where I was going there.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/515-1
01:41:17.035 --> 01:41:19.967
<v Mark Sedge>If it is it and is it in a certain format,
would you,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/513-0
01:41:19.202 --> 01:41:19.322
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/515-2
01:41:19.967 --> 01:41:24.202
<v Mark Sedge>is it like APDF or would it be like an
e-mail? Well, how would you want that?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/514-0
01:41:22.602 --> 01:41:22.722
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/516-0
01:41:24.562 --> 01:41:28.806
<v Josh Sparkes>That doesn't really matter as long as
it's provided by the owner.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/516-1
01:41:28.806 --> 01:41:31.442
<v Josh Sparkes>So whether that be the client compliance.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/520-0
01:41:31.482 --> 01:41:35.970
<v Mark Sedge>I think it matters is because it stops
them just putting any old document in</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/517-0
01:41:32.802 --> 01:41:32.922
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/520-1
01:41:35.970 --> 01:41:39.292
<v Mark Sedge>there with, you know,
got the approval tick on word that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/518-0
01:41:37.122 --> 01:41:37.242
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/519-0
01:41:38.362 --> 01:41:38.482
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/520-2
01:41:39.292 --> 01:41:43.430
<v Mark Sedge>they've written. You know what?
What would you want from them that was</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/521-0
01:41:43.322 --> 01:41:46.571
<v Josh Sparkes>No,
it needs to be an e-mail from the e-mail,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/520-3
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:44.362
<v Mark Sedge>more controlled?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/521-1
01:41:46.571 --> 01:41:52.361
<v Josh Sparkes>like likely then would be an e-mail from
compliance or an e-mail from the client.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/521-2
01:41:52.361 --> 01:41:57.162
<v Josh Sparkes>To say that we can use that imagery at
local. I mean it's actually.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/525-0
01:41:54.562 --> 01:41:58.522
<v Mark Sedge>Perfect. Yeah. OK. So it's So what?
Because what? Sorry, Deborah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/525-1
01:41:58.522 --> 01:42:01.822
<v Mark Sedge>if I may just just outline where my
thinking is going,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/522-0
01:41:59.402 --> 01:41:59.642
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/525-2
01:42:01.822 --> 01:42:06.742
<v Mark Sedge>what we can do is we can put some guide
notes on the record at the point at which</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/523-0
01:42:03.802 --> 01:42:03.922
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/525-3
01:42:06.742 --> 01:42:10.702
<v Mark Sedge>you're asking for it to say this is the
expectation that we have.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/525-4
01:42:10.702 --> 01:42:14.362
<v Mark Sedge>It's a copy of or PDF of the e-mail or
whatever e-mail file.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/524-0
01:42:13.962 --> 01:42:14.082
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/526-0
01:42:14.802 --> 01:42:17.082
<v Mark Sedge>And then that helps your audience know
what they need.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/528-0
01:42:17.602 --> 01:42:21.614
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.
And do they attach the image that they</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/528-1
01:42:21.614 --> 01:42:27.828
<v Josh Sparkes>want or that he's asking you to go and
find that image part of that in airport</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/528-2
01:42:27.828 --> 01:42:33.728
<v Josh Sparkes>scenarios and the other pinpoint on that
one is they've basically stolen a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/528-3
01:42:33.728 --> 01:42:36.402
<v Josh Sparkes>PowerPoint and asked us to be for.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/529-0
01:42:37.442 --> 01:42:40.536
<v Josh Sparkes>Because it's not theirs.
It's not their PowerPoint.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/529-1
01:42:40.536 --> 01:42:44.404
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll have private and confidential.
It's got client information,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/529-2
01:42:44.404 --> 01:42:47.200
<v Josh Sparkes>that's financials. It's not ours.
Got clients.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/529-3
01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:51.841
<v Josh Sparkes>So do you have to then start again?
So we push back and see we're not working</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/529-4
01:42:51.841 --> 01:42:55.590
<v Josh Sparkes>on that unless you've got.
So there's sounds like we've got an</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/529-5
01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:56.482
<v Josh Sparkes>opportunity to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/531-0
01:42:57.162 --> 01:42:59.925
<v Josh Sparkes>Before you,
you know it does this PowerPoint and you</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/531-1
01:42:59.925 --> 01:43:03.991
<v Josh Sparkes>can ask them some leader questions and it
just cuts it off at the pass. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/531-2
01:43:03.991 --> 01:43:06.493
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's the most of the respective
team.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/531-3
01:43:06.493 --> 01:43:10.194
<v Josh Sparkes>And I think it's more about the
compliance aspect of the client terms.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/531-4
01:43:10.194 --> 01:43:13.635
<v Josh Sparkes>So what client terms are,
are we adhering to or for anything as a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/531-5
01:43:13.635 --> 01:43:16.762
<v Josh Sparkes>result of putting that in documentation?
So it cuts it off.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/530-0
01:43:14.082 --> 01:43:14.362
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/533-0
01:43:16.842 --> 01:43:20.088
<v Josh Sparkes>Off of the past,
you just don't have to decline because</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/533-1
01:43:20.088 --> 01:43:24.900
<v Josh Sparkes>they will be declining it based on their
self on the questions that are asking and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/532-0
01:43:20.122 --> 01:43:20.442
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/533-2
01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:27.624
<v Josh Sparkes>if they push it through answering
incorrectly,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/533-3
01:43:27.624 --> 01:43:32.203
<v Josh Sparkes>imagine that you know that conversation
that you can have say you know this is</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/533-4
01:43:32.203 --> 01:43:33.362
<v Josh Sparkes>escalating based on.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/534-0
01:43:34.042 --> 01:43:37.562
<v Josh Sparkes>Excellent. Yeah. Well,
if you're going to say something, sorry.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/536-0
01:43:38.042 --> 01:43:40.372
<v Mark Sedge>No,
I was just going to say that where they</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/536-1
01:43:40.372 --> 01:43:43.232
<v Mark Sedge>where they get those in,
they can just do a straight,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/536-2
01:43:43.232 --> 01:43:46.356
<v Mark Sedge>almost like a straight reject closed
incomplete, you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/535-0
01:43:44.162 --> 01:43:45.642
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/536-3
01:43:46.356 --> 01:43:49.480
<v Mark Sedge>because of these reasons and literally is
there any Emily,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/536-4
01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:53.557
<v Mark Sedge>is there any policy documents that
knowledge collateral that we can point to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/536-5
01:43:53.557 --> 01:43:54.722
<v Mark Sedge>the policies for that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/539-0
01:43:54.562 --> 01:43:59.064
<v Josh Sparkes>It's client terms,
so each client is different,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/538-0
01:43:58.122 --> 01:44:04.002
<v Mark Sedge>Oh, OK, so so it's just the unique terms.
OK, I was just going to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/539-1
01:43:59.064 --> 01:44:05.254
<v Josh Sparkes>all that too copyright,
and what state States 5 and confidential,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/539-2
01:44:05.254 --> 01:44:05.722
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/542-0
01:44:05.522 --> 01:44:08.719
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
I think there might be an opportunity to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/542-1
01:44:08.719 --> 01:44:13.888
<v Mark Sedge>structure and knowledge article that
talks about copyright that talks about</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/542-2
01:44:13.888 --> 01:44:17.561
<v Mark Sedge>some of those criteria,
but also points them back to,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/540-0
01:44:14.362 --> 01:44:14.482
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/542-3
01:44:17.561 --> 01:44:21.982
<v Mark Sedge>you know their their own client terms to
again reduce, you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/541-0
01:44:20.562 --> 01:44:22.202
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/542-4
01:44:21.982 --> 01:44:24.362
<v Mark Sedge>but ultimately when you get one in.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/544-0
01:44:24.962 --> 01:44:29.704
<v Mark Sedge>You can shield yourself by all of those
by just doing a straight reject. Go read.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/543-0
01:44:27.962 --> 01:44:28.082
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/544-1
01:44:29.704 --> 01:44:30.802
<v Mark Sedge>This is what I was.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/545-0
01:44:30.082 --> 01:44:33.154
<v Josh Sparkes>And how sorry and how often do you get
these?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/545-1
01:44:33.154 --> 01:44:37.560
<v Josh Sparkes>We sometimes just get a wind of all of
them all at the same time.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/545-2
01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:42.501
<v Josh Sparkes>And then sometimes we everyone sticks to
the rules and everything's fine.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/545-3
01:44:42.501 --> 01:44:46.174
<v Josh Sparkes>It's really. Oh,
so it's a consistent behaviour. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/545-4
01:44:46.174 --> 01:44:47.642
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a more behaviour.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/546-0
01:44:49.042 --> 01:44:53.630
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not console works as well like no
because you get it and I wave.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/546-1
01:44:53.630 --> 01:44:58.676
<v Josh Sparkes>So I would say is the easiest way to
describe it is we just had a wave there</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/546-2
01:44:58.676 --> 01:45:03.787
<v Josh Sparkes>of those types of requests or can you
repurpose this PowerPoint and use these</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/546-3
01:45:03.787 --> 01:45:07.522
<v Josh Sparkes>logos and it's kind of like it's not that
we can't work.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/547-0
01:45:07.602 --> 01:45:11.251
<v Josh Sparkes>Work on it for the logos,
but we wouldn't actively work on that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/547-1
01:45:11.251 --> 01:45:13.988
<v Josh Sparkes>slide.
So it's maybe it will suggest that we'll</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/547-2
01:45:13.988 --> 01:45:18.549
<v Josh Sparkes>work on all the other slides until you
get that approval and then we'll work on</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/547-3
01:45:18.549 --> 01:45:21.342
<v Josh Sparkes>that slide.
But until you give us that approval,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/547-4
01:45:21.342 --> 01:45:25.048
<v Josh Sparkes>we're not going to do that.
But what that does is puts it in the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/547-5
01:45:25.048 --> 01:45:27.442
<v Josh Sparkes>hands of CMG to say if you want to go and.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/548-0
01:45:27.482 --> 01:45:32.296
<v Josh Sparkes>Work on that. What we sent back.
So I guess this is evidence of upload the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/548-1
01:45:32.296 --> 01:45:37.495
<v Josh Sparkes>original document of what we sent in to
safeguard because we were sending back a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/548-2
01:45:37.495 --> 01:45:40.576
<v Josh Sparkes>document that doesn't include the client
logos.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/548-3
01:45:40.576 --> 01:45:45.775
<v Josh Sparkes>And if they then choose to include the
client logos in that PowerPoint that's on</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/548-4
01:45:45.775 --> 01:45:46.802
<v Josh Sparkes>them and not us.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/549-0
01:45:47.602 --> 01:45:52.506
<v Josh Sparkes>But we can certainly have that free form
that stops a lot of it. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/549-1
01:45:52.506 --> 01:45:57.617
<v Josh Sparkes>And then if you, even if it does,
if you manages to get through the gates</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/549-2
01:45:57.617 --> 01:46:01.346
<v Josh Sparkes>and then you can equally reject it in the
root cause,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/549-3
01:46:01.346 --> 01:46:06.802
<v Josh Sparkes>you can select Y or push back or there
might be on hold. And you say actually.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/550-0
01:46:06.842 --> 01:46:11.282
<v Josh Sparkes>We can use slides one to seven, yeah,
and then it needs to go through that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/550-1
01:46:11.282 --> 01:46:14.716
<v Josh Sparkes>approval process,
but certainly with supporting evidence,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/550-2
01:46:14.716 --> 01:46:17.913
<v Josh Sparkes>as you say,
as Mark said on those client terms can be</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/550-3
01:46:17.913 --> 01:46:21.524
<v Josh Sparkes>incorporated. Yeah. Yeah.
And then I think for anything more</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/550-4
01:46:21.524 --> 01:46:26.082
<v Josh Sparkes>technical that goes out with the realms
of PowerPoint was design team or so.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/551-0
01:46:26.722 --> 01:46:31.677
<v Josh Sparkes>That's the kind of route is straight
transfer dot pod us for OK that kind of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/551-1
01:46:31.677 --> 01:46:36.695
<v Josh Sparkes>more creative aspects and then design
team for anything more techie out with.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/551-2
01:46:36.695 --> 01:46:41.842
<v Josh Sparkes>So it could be that you do a subject of
that and you could then hand it off to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/552-0
01:46:43.362 --> 01:46:48.687
<v Josh Sparkes>If you want to do it a couple, sure,
we wouldn't do it on and pass to design.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/552-1
01:46:48.687 --> 01:46:54.284
<v Josh Sparkes>It can be more about having it over with
our team or there's like 3 avenues for a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/552-2
01:46:54.284 --> 01:46:59.131
<v Josh Sparkes>PowerPoint it can come to document
production for the street transfer.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/552-3
01:46:59.131 --> 01:47:02.202
<v Josh Sparkes>It can come to us for the creativity at
the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/553-0
01:47:02.442 --> 01:47:06.723
<v Josh Sparkes>Make it look brand aligned and a
PowerPoint or there's design where it's</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/553-1
01:47:06.723 --> 01:47:10.535
<v Josh Sparkes>going to be like a brochure client facing
that is more external,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/553-2
01:47:10.535 --> 01:47:13.701
<v Josh Sparkes>but you don't touch the MP. That's design.
OK, great.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/553-3
01:47:13.701 --> 01:47:18.275
<v Josh Sparkes>You get to tend to be the ones in the
middle that are reformatting and client</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/553-4
01:47:18.275 --> 01:47:20.562
<v Josh Sparkes>facing. Yeah, OK. And you work on them.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/554-0
01:47:20.962 --> 01:47:27.411
<v Josh Sparkes>And then so it's got through the gating,
they managed to pass every approval it's</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/554-1
01:47:27.411 --> 01:47:33.860
<v Josh Sparkes>assigned globally as a group and then you
work on it checklist you internal check</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/554-2
01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:39.522
<v Josh Sparkes>balance the team or it's more of a pure
check really it's dependent on.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/555-0
01:47:42.242 --> 01:47:45.458
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
it's a soft check that you could capture</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/555-1
01:47:45.458 --> 01:47:49.221
<v Josh Sparkes>that you know,
you checked this document and then it's</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/555-2
01:47:49.221 --> 01:47:54.079
<v Josh Sparkes>closed and then you attach it the
PowerPoint or does it get man stored</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/555-3
01:47:54.079 --> 01:47:59.210
<v Josh Sparkes>essentially attached and they are.
I sort of go back to that whole content</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/555-4
01:47:59.210 --> 01:47:59.962
<v Josh Sparkes>management.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/559-0
01:48:00.042 --> 01:48:03.639
<v Parik Narain>Deborah. Sorry. Deborah,
may I interrupt for just one minute?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/556-0
01:48:00.522 --> 01:48:00.642
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/557-0
01:48:02.882 --> 01:48:05.202
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh yeah, absolutely sorry.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/559-1
01:48:03.639 --> 01:48:06.308
<v Parik Narain>Just one. Just have a question around,
sorry.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/559-2
01:48:06.308 --> 01:48:09.150
<v Parik Narain>Around these each of these activities,
you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/559-3
01:48:09.150 --> 01:48:12.167
<v Parik Narain>managing presentations and media releases
etcetera,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/559-4
01:48:12.167 --> 01:48:17.040
<v Parik Narain>do ashes have a central platform owned by
comms or marketing where all this content</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/558-0
01:48:16.482 --> 01:48:16.602
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/559-5
01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.722
<v Parik Narain>is generated and distributed.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/561-0
01:48:18.842 --> 01:48:22.688
<v Parik Narain>It across the enterprise Oregon,
is it not? Not a centrally owned function,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/561-1
01:48:22.688 --> 01:48:24.762
<v Parik Narain>centrally owned capability at this point?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/560-0
01:48:22.882 --> 01:48:23.002
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/562-0
01:48:25.922 --> 01:48:28.439
<v Josh Sparkes>No, I think there's document production.
Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/562-1
01:48:28.439 --> 01:48:31.010
<v Josh Sparkes>there's no production for the street
transfers.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/562-2
01:48:31.010 --> 01:48:35.079
<v Josh Sparkes>We're just saying there's three different
areas depending on the documents.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/562-3
01:48:35.079 --> 01:48:39.202
<v Josh Sparkes>And these are the ones that lie with the
capability of client just based on.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/563-0
01:48:39.602 --> 01:48:44.694
<v Josh Sparkes>The reformatting and client facing,
but the other ones are managed by the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/563-1
01:48:44.694 --> 01:48:48.959
<v Josh Sparkes>document production.
The that answers I mean it could be they</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/564-0
01:48:48.322 --> 01:48:51.224
<v Parik Narain>Who creates the content then?
I'm sure you have.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/563-2
01:48:48.959 --> 01:48:49.922
<v Josh Sparkes>handle it all.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/564-1
01:48:51.224 --> 01:48:55.962
<v Parik Narain>I'm sure you have marketing comms content
specialists in in house who are doing</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/564-2
01:48:55.962 --> 01:48:58.805
<v Parik Narain>this or third party is doing this for you.
All.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/564-3
01:48:58.805 --> 01:49:03.306
<v Parik Narain>I'm trying to find out is do we as as
Mark suggested Knowledge management I</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/564-4
01:49:03.306 --> 01:49:03.602
<v Parik Narain>mean.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/568-0
01:49:04.002 --> 01:49:07.366
<v Parik Narain>Knowledge just holds details.
It can be the place where you hold</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/568-1
01:49:07.366 --> 01:49:10.264
<v Parik Narain>copyright information for a for your
enterprise, right?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/566-0
01:49:09.602 --> 01:49:09.722
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/568-2
01:49:10.264 --> 01:49:14.611
<v Parik Narain>The relevance of the document is not bad,
so just trying to find out which document</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/567-0
01:49:11.042 --> 01:49:11.162
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/568-3
01:49:14.611 --> 01:49:18.803
<v Parik Narain>is owned by whom and where is it created
before we decide what goes in knowledge</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/568-4
01:49:18.803 --> 01:49:19.682
<v Parik Narain>and what doesn't.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/570-0
01:49:22.202 --> 01:49:27.202
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, we can park that one.
We can take that one offline,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/570-1
01:49:27.202 --> 01:49:28.362
<v Josh Sparkes>if that's OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/571-0
01:49:29.762 --> 01:49:31.242
<v Parik Narain>OK. Yeah, that's fine. Thank you.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/572-0
01:49:33.082 --> 01:49:39.479
<v Josh Sparkes>So you put it into PowerPoint, attach it.
This is where it's and then they tend to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/572-1
01:49:39.479 --> 01:49:45.028
<v Josh Sparkes>unattach it and then send it to the
client. Is that how it works? Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/572-2
01:49:45.028 --> 01:49:47.802
<v Josh Sparkes>briefing. Probably with the partner.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/573-0
01:49:47.962 --> 01:49:53.266
<v Josh Sparkes>OK invisions need to be made invisions
that same cycle again could be us nine</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/573-1
01:49:53.266 --> 01:49:57.006
<v Josh Sparkes>times at 10.
I would say it's us over them and then it</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/573-2
01:49:57.006 --> 01:50:00.814
<v Josh Sparkes>goes back to the sign off and then off
the decline. OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/573-3
01:50:00.814 --> 01:50:04.894
<v Josh Sparkes>And you would presume you want to have
the original attack,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/573-4
01:50:04.894 --> 01:50:07.682
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean this is what we talked to earlier.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/575-0
01:50:07.762 --> 01:50:11.342
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that the service now?
Shouldn't be your managed content central</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/575-1
01:50:11.342 --> 01:50:14.867
<v Josh Sparkes>management content that we can.
That's a wide conversation. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/575-2
01:50:14.867 --> 01:50:19.248
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's where becomes important in
cases when it's the evidence that we're</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/575-3
01:50:19.248 --> 01:50:22.506
<v Josh Sparkes>not reaching client care. Yes,
from that client perspective,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/575-4
01:50:22.506 --> 01:50:24.162
<v Josh Sparkes>but if they choose to on their.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/576-0
01:50:25.202 --> 01:50:28.690
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry, that's something OK and like,
can I just ask, sorry,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/576-1
01:50:28.690 --> 01:50:32.875
<v Josh Sparkes>this might be silly question,
but could it not all set with dot prod or</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/576-2
01:50:32.875 --> 01:50:36.362
<v Josh Sparkes>those are reasons as to why some of the
stuff comes to use?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/577-0
01:50:38.882 --> 01:50:44.775
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just saying if not, why not?
We did that yesterday, didn't we?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/577-1
01:50:44.775 --> 01:50:51.436
<v Josh Sparkes>Why does it say feedback is always that
dog pods level and quality is not the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/577-2
01:50:51.436 --> 01:50:52.802
<v Josh Sparkes>same, right? OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/578-0
01:50:53.762 --> 01:50:56.609
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what we'll say is the matter to be
that's something,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/578-1
01:50:56.609 --> 01:50:59.835
<v Josh Sparkes>at least we could look at. Yeah.
Just want to write a conversation.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/578-2
01:50:59.835 --> 01:51:03.726
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's because it's client and so
it's client face and they deal with a lot</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/578-3
01:51:03.726 --> 01:51:06.762
<v Josh Sparkes>more internal and their capabilities
doing aren't the same. OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/580-0
01:51:08.682 --> 01:51:11.403
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, but there's some.
There's there's a challenge there that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/579-0
01:51:09.162 --> 01:51:09.282
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/580-1
01:51:11.403 --> 01:51:14.209
<v Mark Sedge>goes. That team says, why isn't it?
And when it's client facing,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/582-0
01:51:13.322 --> 01:51:17.121
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah. We're just saying that.
If not, why not? Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/580-2
01:51:14.209 --> 01:51:15.202
<v Mark Sedge>what are your controls?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/582-1
01:51:17.121 --> 01:51:20.661
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a it's a wider discussion.
Wiser discussions are.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/582-2
01:51:20.661 --> 01:51:25.425
<v Josh Sparkes>It's been brought up several times.
And generally then what happens is it</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/582-3
01:51:25.425 --> 01:51:29.802
<v Josh Sparkes>results in US getting more work decision.
Like who? Who is it that?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/581-0
01:51:26.802 --> 01:51:27.922

<v Josh Sparkes>because the obviously when we are not the
host, we are just.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/605-0
01:55:05.322 --> 01:55:10.346

So that's effectively,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/606-2
01:55:29.529 --> 01:55:32.947

01:55:42.522 --> 01:55:46.676
<v Josh Sparkes>In relation to awards. Yeah, yeah,
it's I think the terminology is computing.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/608-1

01:55:58.925 --> 01:56:00.682
<v Josh Sparkes>process where you're shortlisted.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/609-0

01:56:05.191 --> 01:56:09.820
<v Josh Sparkes>That's fine. Maybe we won't talk to that.
But what other events are you managing</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/609-2
01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:13.362
<v Josh Sparkes>that come in to show?
Or today that are outside of what we've</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/609-3
01:56:13.362 --> 01:56:16.734
<v Josh Sparkes>discussed already?
All the events that as just host client</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/609-4
01:56:16.734 --> 01:56:18.962
<v Josh Sparkes>events. OK, so they call client events.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/610-0
01:56:19.202 --> 01:56:25.492
<v Josh Sparkes>We only support client events, OK,
no internal events and are they</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/610-1
01:56:25.492 --> 01:56:33.377
<v Josh Sparkes>categorised categories into it could be a
whole host of things. Sorry. Yeah, M&amp;</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/610-2
01:56:33.377 --> 01:56:35.442
<v Josh Sparkes>R and person seminars.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/611-0
01:56:36.722 --> 01:56:41.696
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, social gatherings.
OK and who tends to how do they tend to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/611-1
01:56:41.696 --> 01:56:46.288
<v Josh Sparkes>land with you today? Best process,
that first heritage. OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/611-2
01:56:46.288 --> 01:56:52.715
<v Josh Sparkes>So we start with the could we have it two
regions or France and everyone else do it</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/611-3
01:56:52.715 --> 01:56:56.082
<v Josh Sparkes>differently as well. So maybe the two,
two.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/612-0
01:56:56.162 --> 01:57:03.021
<v Josh Sparkes>Regions UK and Australia we start with
the UK today. How do they come in?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/612-1
01:57:03.021 --> 01:57:08.489
<v Josh Sparkes>So maybe it's on for Australia because
that's the easiest.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/612-2
01:57:08.489 --> 01:57:11.362
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia's as the events team.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/613-0
01:57:11.922 --> 01:57:18.809
<v Josh Sparkes>Scope out the event with the CMG contact.
Build out the requirements and then</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/613-1
01:57:18.809 --> 01:57:25.960
<v Josh Sparkes>utilise the events work request form,
work events, form work, yeah, events work,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/613-2

<v Josh Sparkes>request form that's currently hosted on
share mail the select.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/614-0
01:57:31.562 --> 01:57:34.665
<v Josh Sparkes>It's each of the categories that they
require for that event.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/614-1
01:57:34.665 --> 01:57:38.517
<v Josh Sparkes>Not every event follows the same format
as based on the requirements of what</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/614-2
01:57:38.517 --> 01:57:41.720
<v Josh Sparkes>they're trying to achieve.
If we can get the visibility of that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/614-3
01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:44.972
<v Josh Sparkes>format, yeah, we don't share it now,
but at least we have. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/614-4
01:57:44.972 --> 01:57:45.722
<v Josh Sparkes>we can do that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/615-0
01:57:47.642 --> 01:57:52.763
<v Josh Sparkes>They put through that request,
we receive each of those that each</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/615-1
01:57:52.763 --> 01:57:56.409
<v Josh Sparkes>generate a case and share. Well,
as it stands,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/615-2
01:57:56.409 --> 01:58:01.452
<v Josh Sparkes>that's then allocated out to the team
based on the fire by date.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/615-3
01:58:01.452 --> 01:58:06.029
<v Josh Sparkes>What's involved.
So we just if we go back so they they are</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/615-4
01:58:06.029 --> 01:58:06.882
<v Josh Sparkes>who the go.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/616-0
01:58:06.922 --> 01:58:12.130
<v Josh Sparkes>So to CMG originally to fill in that form.
Who's who's that original trigger?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/616-1
01:58:12.130 --> 01:58:17.805
<v Josh Sparkes>The events do you mean to the events team
that put in form? Yes. To the events team.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/616-2
01:58:17.805 --> 01:58:20.676
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
Trans Team events team longer with our</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/616-3
01:58:20.676 --> 01:58:24.014
<v Josh Sparkes>form. Yeah.
And that's following our conversation</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/616-4
01:58:24.014 --> 01:58:25.082
<v Josh Sparkes>with CMG and OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/617-0
01:58:25.682 --> 01:58:29.842
<v Josh Sparkes>So they they do that. OK,
so that's a pre approval that we're going</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/617-1
01:58:29.842 --> 01:58:34.246
<v Josh Sparkes>to, they're going to be at that event,
they're going to run that event,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/617-2
01:58:34.246 --> 01:58:38.895
<v Josh Sparkes>they're going to run that event, OK.
It's something that Ash has on running</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/617-3
01:58:38.895 --> 01:58:43.482
<v Josh Sparkes>the events organising the event. OK.
So as you said they these are hosted.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/618-0
01:58:44.042 --> 01:58:48.225
<v Josh Sparkes>Events. OK,
these are not ones that you're attending.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/618-1
01:58:48.225 --> 01:58:51.711
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
this is all the ones that are being able</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/618-2
01:58:51.711 --> 01:58:55.507
<v Josh Sparkes>to find. OK,
so you get then based on that form,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/618-3
01:58:55.507 --> 01:58:59.922
<v Josh Sparkes>we can have it, you know add category,
you get one task.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/619-0
01:59:02.322 --> 01:59:04.122
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, yes, it's probably easier.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/620-0
01:59:06.082 --> 01:59:11.526
<v Josh Sparkes>And in this case it would go to because
Australia are doing it differently.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/620-1
01:59:11.526 --> 01:59:16.898
<v Josh Sparkes>You can have client Australia is the
assignment group and they can another</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/620-2
01:59:16.898 --> 01:59:21.482
<v Josh Sparkes>project and flight to standardise the
whole process. Yeah with.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/621-0
01:59:22.202 --> 01:59:26.683
<v Josh Sparkes>The future project aligning with it as
well because that will bring in the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/621-1
01:59:26.683 --> 01:59:31.702
<v Josh Sparkes>change of system restriction and allow us
to work across the platforms and then the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/621-2
01:59:31.702 --> 01:59:35.764
<v Josh Sparkes>rules and responsibilities are currently
being reviewed as to what.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/621-3
01:59:35.764 --> 01:59:40.544
<v Josh Sparkes>But if we go through the workplace here,
there's recommendations to standardise</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/621-4
01:59:40.544 --> 01:59:40.842
<v Josh Sparkes>that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/622-0
01:59:41.202 --> 01:59:44.107
<v Josh Sparkes>What, though,
is that duplicate overlap of these?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/622-1
01:59:44.107 --> 01:59:47.011
<v Josh Sparkes>Because that's what we're trying to get
to today.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/622-2
01:59:47.011 --> 01:59:50.438
<v Josh Sparkes>Isn't a global view of those processes
formal consistency?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/622-3
01:59:50.438 --> 01:59:54.678
<v Josh Sparkes>But what I can't confirm I know is what
is should be the global process.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/622-4
01:59:54.678 --> 01:59:58.162
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's what's still in discussion with
the stakeholders.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/623-0
01:59:59.322 --> 02:00:02.564
<v Josh Sparkes>But from the recommendations that we
capture through these,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/623-1
02:00:02.564 --> 02:00:06.670
<v Josh Sparkes>we could recommend that you know these
are the touch points and that global</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/623-2
02:00:06.670 --> 02:00:09.263
<v Josh Sparkes>process.
And I think what ties into that is the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/623-3
02:00:09.263 --> 02:00:12.073
<v Josh Sparkes>future project for the platform change as
well. OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/623-4
02:00:12.073 --> 02:00:15.962
<v Josh Sparkes>So they they all work together along with
the process of session state.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/625-0
02:00:16.562 --> 02:00:19.200
<v Josh Sparkes>Project.
Then we're looking at each of the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/625-1
02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:22.391
<v Josh Sparkes>different,
but then we just now to align with that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/625-2
02:00:22.391 --> 02:00:27.176
<v Josh Sparkes>There's no duplicate or overlap on that
project who's running that project on</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/625-3
02:00:27.176 --> 02:00:27.482
<v Josh Sparkes>that?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/626-0
02:00:29.002 --> 02:00:33.251
<v Josh Sparkes>It's John. John is dealing with it.
I'm making it. What's it called?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/626-1
02:00:33.251 --> 02:00:38.177

request form and the work request form.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/627-0

I'll do it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/628-0

02:01:17.644 --> 02:01:22.162
<v Josh Sparkes>populated data if that's OK.
These are all the issues of this is.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/630-0
02:01:25.042 --> 02:01:25.962

<v Josh Sparkes>Offices.
Or is this a one to one that they have to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/632-1
02:01:40.816 --> 02:01:47.206
<v Josh Sparkes>fill it in? Do you tend to have one host,
one event, one place you? Surely. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/632-2
02:01:47.206 --> 02:01:52.661
<v Josh Sparkes>Unless it's a webinar. Yeah,
and sometimes now the the German Germany</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/632-3
02:01:52.661 --> 02:01:54.842
<v Josh Sparkes>of the Germany of this they.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/633-0
02:01:56.682 --> 02:02:01.931
<v Josh Sparkes>Trying to run events,
mostly webinar into different locations,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/633-1
02:02:01.931 --> 02:02:06.429
<v Josh Sparkes>so yeah OK,
they want to run the same webinar in like</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/633-2
02:02:06.429 --> 02:02:12.843
<v Josh Sparkes>Frankfurt on Monday and then we make on
another time. Oh, no, no right case,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/633-3
02:02:12.843 --> 02:02:14.842
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's the same event.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/634-0
02:02:14.962 --> 02:02:19.212
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, that's OK. OK. So it's OK. It's OK.
They complete this.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/634-1
02:02:19.212 --> 02:02:23.322
<v Josh Sparkes>It plans with yourself.
But they say no one single invite.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/635-0
02:02:25.602 --> 02:02:29.637
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, OK,
so this for populated practise industry.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/635-1
02:02:29.637 --> 02:02:36.635
<v Josh Sparkes>Let's have a quick look at that drop down.
Do you mind? So these are all OK digital,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/635-2
02:02:36.635 --> 02:02:40.257
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, small for our reporting.
So would they?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/635-3
02:02:40.257 --> 02:02:42.562
<v Josh Sparkes>That's something they don't.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/636-0
02:02:43.442 --> 02:02:48.090
<v Josh Sparkes>That's something you in which after the
request was it something they select no</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/636-1
02:02:48.090 --> 02:02:51.285
<v Josh Sparkes>they select.
So the same where you've got the briefing</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/636-2
02:02:51.285 --> 02:02:56.048
<v Josh Sparkes>form link that there's a form that events
go through with CMG to complete as part</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/636-3
02:02:56.048 --> 02:02:58.837
<v Josh Sparkes>of that briefing and then they attach it,
yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/636-4
02:02:58.837 --> 02:03:02.322
<v Josh Sparkes>And it attaches and effectively that's
the the purpose and.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/637-0
02:03:02.642 --> 02:03:06.845
<v Josh Sparkes>Who that then links to the practise and
industry that it's for?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/637-1
02:03:06.845 --> 02:03:11.639
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's obviously it has to be
strategic so that the whole purpose of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/637-2
02:03:11.639 --> 02:03:16.695
<v Josh Sparkes>client events is it needs to be strategic.
It's not just monitoring for sake</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/637-3
02:03:16.695 --> 02:03:21.423
<v Josh Sparkes>leadership drinks and food. Yes,
there's an outcome required and how it</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/637-4
02:03:21.423 --> 02:03:21.882
<v Josh Sparkes>aligns.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/638-0
02:03:22.082 --> 02:03:29.682
<v Josh Sparkes>The strategy? Yeah. OK. Understood.
So you received this on A1 task one.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/639-0
02:03:31.842 --> 02:03:35.146
<v Josh Sparkes>Event basis correct? Yes.
And then you can assign and.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/639-1
02:03:35.146 --> 02:03:40.132
<v Josh Sparkes>What's this sort of SLA? What's the lead?
So we're now now you've got it assigned,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/639-2
02:03:40.132 --> 02:03:43.616
<v Josh Sparkes>you're going to assign it to someone who
is in Australia.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/639-3
02:03:43.616 --> 02:03:47.701
<v Josh Sparkes>What do they have to then do?
What's their tasks that they start to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/639-4
02:03:47.701 --> 02:03:49.082
<v Josh Sparkes>work on for this event?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/640-0
02:03:49.962 --> 02:03:53.598
<v Josh Sparkes>Whatever selected here.
So from a pre event selection,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/640-1
02:03:53.598 --> 02:03:58.887
<v Josh Sparkes>that's the option of what we can support
on when the left hand side and write a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/640-2
02:03:58.887 --> 02:04:02.522
<v Josh Sparkes>folder request feed photos and so they
can do each of.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/641-0
02:04:05.202 --> 02:04:09.190
<v Josh Sparkes>So you could just select put in the
required by, but because for an event,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/641-1
02:04:09.190 --> 02:04:13.284
<v Josh Sparkes>naturally it's an event wants to be
hosted with all that pre event work that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/641-2
02:04:13.284 --> 02:04:17.219
<v Josh Sparkes>needs to happen ahead of the event taking
place, and then the host event,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/641-3
02:04:17.219 --> 02:04:19.878
<v Josh Sparkes>what's all the activity that they need to
happen?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/641-4
02:04:19.878 --> 02:04:22.642
<v Josh Sparkes>There needs to be sub tasks of the
paragraph, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/642-0
02:04:25.322 --> 02:04:29.378
<v Josh Sparkes>There's multiple ones there,
so they've got you can have both free</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/642-1
02:04:29.378 --> 02:04:34.220
<v Josh Sparkes>event and closed event activity on the
same event that they can select and each</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/642-2
02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:39.002
<v Josh Sparkes>of those could be sub tasks for a due
date that's ordered even though they're.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/643-0
02:04:39.402 --> 02:04:44.320
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be that the setup interaction
folder comes after the request of,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/643-1
02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:48.241
<v Josh Sparkes>you know and surmising,
but it could be those dates can be</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/643-2
02:04:48.241 --> 02:04:52.361
<v Josh Sparkes>ordered for you in the way in which you
go through the tasks.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/643-3
02:04:52.361 --> 02:04:56.082
<v Josh Sparkes>Or do they tend to just put required by
the event date?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/644-0
02:04:58.442 --> 02:05:03.444
<v Josh Sparkes>The pre event stuff does need to be done.
What what I'm saying is that so I'm</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/644-1
02:05:03.444 --> 02:05:06.778
<v Josh Sparkes>challenging. Why?
If you know the event dates, why?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/644-2
02:05:06.778 --> 02:05:11.843
<v Josh Sparkes>Why let the request to set the date when
the Slas you know could be some days.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/644-3
02:05:11.843 --> 02:05:15.882
<v Josh Sparkes>So they for the interaction list for
example that needs to be.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/645-0
02:05:16.002 --> 02:05:19.871
<v Josh Sparkes>Viewed by other groups,
if you want to maybe invite other clients</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/645-1
02:05:19.871 --> 02:05:24.268
<v Josh Sparkes>so that opportunity that needs to be
presented to the other groups to feed</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/645-2
02:05:24.268 --> 02:05:28.371
<v Josh Sparkes>into that interaction list.
But I'm thinking that they could be based</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/645-3
02:05:28.371 --> 02:05:32.122
<v Josh Sparkes>on. So if you work backwards.
So if that is the case that that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/646-0
02:05:32.442 --> 02:05:38.409
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's, say, the event is was today,
that interactive folder needed to be done</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/646-1
02:05:38.409 --> 02:05:42.735
<v Josh Sparkes>-10 days, you know it.
The system calculates that because</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/646-2
02:05:42.735 --> 02:05:46.762
<v Josh Sparkes>there's workflows associated with that
and review it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/647-0
02:05:47.442 --> 02:05:51.027
<v Josh Sparkes>That it calculates the requested date by
and puts them in order.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/647-1
02:05:51.027 --> 02:05:55.384
<v Josh Sparkes>You know there's some things that are
probably more complex to do than others,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/647-2
02:05:55.384 --> 02:05:58.362
<v Josh Sparkes>but do you?
Does it tend to be the case at the moment</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/647-3
02:05:58.362 --> 02:06:02.884
<v Josh Sparkes>that the requester enters those each of
those dates when the OK they dictate what</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/647-4
02:06:02.884 --> 02:06:04.042
<v Josh Sparkes>they require by date?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/648-0
02:06:05.202 --> 02:06:06.442
<v Josh Sparkes>And they tend to be realistic.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/649-0
02:06:09.122 --> 02:06:12.039
<v Josh Sparkes>For Australia,
if we're talking about Australia then yes,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/649-1
02:06:12.039 --> 02:06:15.257
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. I mean something that,
I mean we could have a look at that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/649-2
02:06:15.257 --> 02:06:19.381
<v Josh Sparkes>It tends to take 10 days and work for you
know we could start to build in some of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/649-3
02:06:19.381 --> 02:06:21.794
<v Josh Sparkes>that.
But at the moment as a maybe it's a phase</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/649-4
02:06:21.794 --> 02:06:24.057
<v Josh Sparkes>one,
they set those dates and you get them a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/649-5
02:06:24.057 --> 02:06:24.962
<v Josh Sparkes>sub task for that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/650-0
02:06:25.882 --> 02:06:29.592
<v Josh Sparkes>The way it the way it works just now and
correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/650-1
02:06:29.592 --> 02:06:34.033
<v Josh Sparkes>but when an event request forms filled
out and they select maybe 5-6 different</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/650-2
02:06:34.033 --> 02:06:36.619
<v Josh Sparkes>tasks,
whether it's P or post comes in as six</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/650-3
02:06:36.619 --> 02:06:39.879
<v Josh Sparkes>different cases,
whereas the moment we're just having one</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/650-4
02:06:39.879 --> 02:06:43.871
<v Josh Sparkes>parent and six subtasks. Yeah.
Whereas I think from service now we can</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/650-5
02:06:43.871 --> 02:06:44.882
<v Josh Sparkes>just have the one.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/651-0
02:06:45.402 --> 02:06:48.519
<v Josh Sparkes>Because obviously we don't have tasks
right now,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/651-1
02:06:48.519 --> 02:06:53.099
<v Josh Sparkes>so I think that's maybe the why it's been
set up like that potentially.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/651-2
02:06:53.099 --> 02:06:55.898
<v Josh Sparkes>But in service now if we can maybe make
it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/651-3
02:06:55.898 --> 02:06:59.333
<v Josh Sparkes>you're managing the events and these will
be cheques,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/651-4
02:06:59.333 --> 02:07:03.722
<v Josh Sparkes>but you need to complete for it, see,
see like for example again if.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/652-0
02:07:04.202 --> 02:07:07.412
<v Josh Sparkes>Six tasks were selected.
They could be assigned to like for</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/652-1
02:07:07.412 --> 02:07:11.209
<v Josh Sparkes>example, one could be assigned to Mandy,
one could be assigned to Sam.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/652-2
02:07:11.209 --> 02:07:15.649
<v Josh Sparkes>Can we still do that even if there's some
tasks assigned them to different people?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/652-3
02:07:15.649 --> 02:07:18.002
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, perfect.
And you're reporting for some.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/653-0
02:07:19.682 --> 02:07:23.087
<v Josh Sparkes>Tasks.
You can report subtasks and task levels.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/653-1
02:07:23.087 --> 02:07:27.201
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, so it's across all right.
You can do that. It's data.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/653-2
02:07:27.201 --> 02:07:30.960
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a tree of data. Yeah.
That's essentially. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/653-3
02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:35.002
<v Josh Sparkes>You're not just reporting on the one.
So you could have.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/654-0
02:07:35.482 --> 02:07:38.317
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean Mark correctly wrong.
You can have three people on one,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/654-1
02:07:38.317 --> 02:07:42.007
<v Josh Sparkes>you know on the six tasks you could have,
each one could be assigned to different</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/654-2
02:07:42.007 --> 02:07:45.202
<v Josh Sparkes>people or it could be the same person and
you can be assigned as well.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/654-3
02:07:45.202 --> 02:07:48.352
<v Josh Sparkes>That's the ability to do that.
But you in fact you've got that parent</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/654-4
02:07:48.352 --> 02:07:50.242
<v Josh Sparkes>and then the subtask associated with that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/655-0
02:07:50.802 --> 02:07:56.011
<v Josh Sparkes>And it could be that it only the parent
only gets closed complete when everything</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/655-1
02:07:56.011 --> 02:08:01.283
<v Josh Sparkes>you know the Last Post event has happened.
So it always remains open for the whole</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/655-2
02:08:01.283 --> 02:08:03.442
<v Josh Sparkes>life cycle of the event, you know.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/664-0
02:08:04.642 --> 02:08:09.440
<v Mark Sedge>And what you could do is if you've got
certain members of your team who are, say,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/656-0
02:08:05.722 --> 02:08:05.842
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/657-0
02:08:08.642 --> 02:08:08.762
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/664-1
02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:12.072
<v Mark Sedge>really good at doing a certain part of
that,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/658-0
02:08:10.792 --> 02:08:10.912
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/664-2
02:08:12.072 --> 02:08:16.519
<v Mark Sedge>you know you might turn around and say
and they more importantly they enjoy</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/659-0
02:08:12.362 --> 02:08:13.002
<v Josh Sparkes>Stop this.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/660-0
02:08:15.282 --> 02:08:15.402
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/664-3
02:08:16.519 --> 02:08:19.385
<v Mark Sedge>doing it,
then maybe you can auto assign some of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/661-0
02:08:17.362 --> 02:08:17.482
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/664-4
02:08:19.385 --> 02:08:21.842
<v Mark Sedge>those tasks directly to those individuals.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/662-0
02:08:21.002 --> 02:08:21.122
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/665-0
02:08:22.242 --> 02:08:24.722
<v Mark Sedge>Because they can do it well and do it
easily. Maybe.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/663-0
02:08:22.322 --> 02:08:22.442
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/666-0
02:08:25.482 --> 02:08:27.924
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
I think you've got that skill based</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/666-1
02:08:27.924 --> 02:08:30.773
<v Josh Sparkes>matrix,
haven't you that some of those event you</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/666-2
02:08:30.773 --> 02:08:33.913
<v Josh Sparkes>know some of those tasks can be this
person has them,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/666-3
02:08:33.913 --> 02:08:38.797
<v Josh Sparkes>they've got the experience to handle that.
So this is one of our high volume tasks.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/666-4
02:08:38.797 --> 02:08:41.122
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's some publications and I think.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/667-0
02:08:41.962 --> 02:08:46.892
<v Josh Sparkes>I guess my concern on that approach, Mark,
would be that you then you're targeting</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/667-1
02:08:46.892 --> 02:08:51.642
<v Josh Sparkes>the same people and it's repetition.
So that's what developed for people, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/668-0
02:08:48.722 --> 02:08:52.502
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. Now, now you've said that. Yeah,
yeah. Now you said that you just want,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/668-1
02:08:52.502 --> 02:08:55.602
<v Mark Sedge>you want to basically have everybody
immersed in it, don't you?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/669-0
02:08:55.922 --> 02:08:58.945
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, and.
And given the volume that we get across</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/669-1
02:08:58.945 --> 02:09:03.745
<v Josh Sparkes>the globe for events and yet what could
quite easily happen as I just have an an</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/669-2
02:09:03.745 --> 02:09:07.122
<v Josh Sparkes>event person and they don't do anything
else but events.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/669-3
02:09:07.122 --> 02:09:11.745
<v Josh Sparkes>So does it tend to be that one event
safely to the parent and the child tasks</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/669-4
02:09:11.745 --> 02:09:15.122
<v Josh Sparkes>if you pick up the parents,
does it tend to be that you?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/670-0
02:09:15.282 --> 02:09:19.987
<v Josh Sparkes>You're also going to do the pre events
and the most events you'd work on the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/670-1
02:09:19.987 --> 02:09:24.937
<v Josh Sparkes>whole thing one person or there's lots of
people doing all that and you can just</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/670-2
02:09:24.937 --> 02:09:28.848
<v Josh Sparkes>assign that in the first phase.
How you'd like to. So they get.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/670-3
02:09:28.848 --> 02:09:33.003
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean maybe each of them,
if you look about the life cycle of each</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/670-4
02:09:33.003 --> 02:09:35.202
<v Josh Sparkes>task, it'd be new working programme.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/671-0
02:09:35.282 --> 02:09:39.102
<v Josh Sparkes>Address in review. Is that right?
It needs to be reviewed. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/671-1
02:09:39.102 --> 02:09:41.863
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe the photos. I mean,
I look at the photo,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/671-2
02:09:41.863 --> 02:09:45.859
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't want that one review.
It send you back. Photo distribution.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/671-3
02:09:45.859 --> 02:09:49.032
<v Josh Sparkes>All of that will be reviewed and tweaked
and changed.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/671-4
02:09:49.032 --> 02:09:52.322
<v Josh Sparkes>Each of those things distributed are
reviewed. Checked.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/672-0
02:09:52.722 --> 02:09:58.257
<v Josh Sparkes>Close. Complete. Yeah,
we link up with design as well as there's</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/672-1
02:09:58.257 --> 02:10:04.642
<v Josh Sparkes>customization that needs to be made,
so there would be the joy up with the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/672-2
02:10:04.642 --> 02:10:07.962
<v Josh Sparkes>design team if needed. If or always if.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/673-0
02:10:08.402 --> 02:10:11.966
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
What things do they tend to do that you</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/673-1
02:10:11.966 --> 02:10:18.396
<v Josh Sparkes>don't get involved in if it goes out with
the realms of the template that's in the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/673-2
02:10:18.396 --> 02:10:23.586
<v Josh Sparkes>system, then it's designed.
Are they exceptions or they tend to be</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/673-3
02:10:23.586 --> 02:10:25.522
<v Josh Sparkes>the ones that are normal.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/674-0
02:10:25.922 --> 02:10:26.402
<v Josh Sparkes>Typical.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/676-0
02:10:28.602 --> 02:10:31.596
<v Josh Sparkes>Exceptions.
So it's where they're they're making a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/676-1
02:10:31.596 --> 02:10:33.122
<v Josh Sparkes>customization to a tablet.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/677-0
02:10:36.602 --> 02:10:42.746
<v Josh Sparkes>Which ones? Which activity were they on?
If I had to look at those pre events,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/677-1
02:10:42.746 --> 02:10:47.722
<v Josh Sparkes>which ones are those on invitation for
what line the follow up?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/678-0
02:10:49.202 --> 02:10:56.498
<v Josh Sparkes>But the I think the customization will
probably appear early in the stage that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/678-1
02:10:56.498 --> 02:11:01.762
<v Josh Sparkes>in the event in the Asian stage we do
that on behalf of.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/680-0
02:11:03.442 --> 02:11:08.963
<v Josh Sparkes>As well, so we would log it with design,
yeah, and do it for them. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/680-1
02:11:08.963 --> 02:11:13.273
<v Josh Sparkes>So giving IES with design on like passing
these the the,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/680-2
02:11:13.273 --> 02:11:19.322
<v Josh Sparkes>the the document production whose design
are they separate or group is matched.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/681-0
02:11:20.362 --> 02:11:24.067
<v Josh Sparkes>Does that all under document reduction,
or is that another design group?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/681-1
02:11:24.067 --> 02:11:25.082
<v Josh Sparkes>Separate is 18 yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/682-0
02:11:27.082 --> 02:11:33.792
<v Josh Sparkes>So just remind me what artefact is that
on or what task is that on on those pre</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/682-1
02:11:33.792 --> 02:11:40.584
<v Josh Sparkes>cheques it was create joint like create
reminder confirmation reminder follow up</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/682-2
02:11:40.584 --> 02:11:41.842
<v Josh Sparkes>speak about to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/683-0
02:11:43.202 --> 02:11:46.214
<v Josh Sparkes>Well, we're about to get access. Yeah,
you guys.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/683-1
02:11:46.214 --> 02:11:48.242
<v Josh Sparkes>Invitation reminder confirmation.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/684-0
02:11:51.002 --> 02:11:58.182
<v Josh Sparkes>Great. Follow up. Yeah.
So create follow up create reminder and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/684-1
02:11:58.182 --> 02:12:06.482
<v Josh Sparkes>confirmation are these like e-mail
templates. Take it, check it check it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/685-0
02:12:08.642 --> 02:12:15.688
<v Josh Sparkes>So we don't have the ability to solve
HTML coding because it has to be</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/685-1
02:12:15.688 --> 02:12:21.840
<v Josh Sparkes>precisely laid down. Yeah,
so that it can deliver through the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/685-2
02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:26.602
<v Josh Sparkes>interaction system and arrive at the
recipient.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/686-0
02:12:26.762 --> 02:12:32.114
<v Josh Sparkes>Involved in a proper way? Yeah, we we had.
If we try some incidents that the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/686-1
02:12:32.114 --> 02:12:37.327
<v Josh Sparkes>application landed in the recipient
involved like there's something we can</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/686-2
02:12:37.327 --> 02:12:41.080
<v Josh Sparkes>mark and see.
We can have a look at the formatting of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/686-3
02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:45.389
<v Josh Sparkes>that lands. You know,
you're not having to pass it on that we</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/686-4
02:12:45.389 --> 02:12:46.362
<v Josh Sparkes>can certainly.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/687-0
02:12:46.522 --> 02:12:50.007
<v Josh Sparkes>If you're going to fix that as well,
sorry if you're charged.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/687-1
02:12:50.007 --> 02:12:53.829
<v Josh Sparkes>So the new platform, exactly.
So it'll be that there wouldn't be as</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/687-2
02:12:53.829 --> 02:12:58.268
<v Josh Sparkes>much of the need to go to design at least
a lot of snap and move around. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/687-3
02:12:58.268 --> 02:13:02.202
<v Josh Sparkes>So the two B world is something that we
set something different, yes.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/688-0
02:13:02.602 --> 02:13:06.591
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. So they're then,
so we've done that new work in progress,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/688-1
02:13:06.591 --> 02:13:08.842
<v Josh Sparkes>iterations, reviews close complete.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/689-0
02:13:10.442 --> 02:13:13.408
<v Josh Sparkes>Right.
And then you've got the actual events</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/689-1
02:13:13.408 --> 02:13:17.888
<v Josh Sparkes>itself. So all the you're hosting it.
And so yesterday catering in,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/689-2
02:13:17.888 --> 02:13:22.105
<v Josh Sparkes>you know interaction you don't get
involved in in all that, OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/689-3
02:13:22.105 --> 02:13:26.717
<v Josh Sparkes>so that was quite interesting
requirements and interaction, don't we?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/689-4
02:13:26.717 --> 02:13:29.682
<v Josh Sparkes>You've died to requirements for
interaction.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/690-0
02:13:30.162 --> 02:13:34.842
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, additional field that's included.
So is at that point should catering be</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/690-1
02:13:34.842 --> 02:13:39.702
<v Josh Sparkes>imposed because they we were discussing
yesterday what they have including them,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/690-2
02:13:39.702 --> 02:13:44.322
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be at that point they get
informed that this event is happening and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/690-3
02:13:44.322 --> 02:13:46.362
<v Josh Sparkes>you know the dietary requirements.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/691-0
02:13:48.082 --> 02:13:52.562
<v Josh Sparkes>Would that be a point that they gets good,
good in, you know, good heads up on it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/693-0
02:13:53.362 --> 02:13:59.030
<v Mark Sedge>But doesn't that assumes that it's the
catering of our IE ashes catering. Rather,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/692-0
02:13:57.482 --> 02:14:00.162
<v Josh Sparkes>We will have to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/693-1
02:13:59.030 --> 02:14:04.282
<v Mark Sedge>it might be an alternative catering
organisation. Or is it always your own?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/695-0
02:14:04.522 --> 02:14:09.606
<v Josh Sparkes>So we share this information back with
the events team and it's there for the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/695-1
02:14:09.606 --> 02:14:13.516
<v Josh Sparkes>events team to share what,
whether that be actors catering,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/694-0
02:14:13.082 --> 02:14:13.482
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/695-2
02:14:13.516 --> 02:14:17.882
<v Josh Sparkes>if it's held an actress,
office or externally on a like a tail or.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/696-0
02:14:18.122 --> 02:14:21.275
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
but it is internal that we're doing it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/696-1
02:14:21.275 --> 02:14:26.003
<v Josh Sparkes>It's certainly an opportunity where they
could be informed heads up.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/696-2
02:14:26.003 --> 02:14:29.703
<v Josh Sparkes>I guess that comes from events though to
inform that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/696-3
02:14:29.703 --> 02:14:34.362
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's the events in the case of
Australia that the events team.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/697-0
02:14:34.802 --> 02:14:40.785
<v Josh Sparkes>Share that information with so then
that's close. You have the actual events.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/697-1
02:14:40.785 --> 02:14:44.389
<v Josh Sparkes>What?
What bits do you get involved in for the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/697-2
02:14:44.389 --> 02:14:49.528
<v Josh Sparkes>actual event? If anything,
are you just doing the pre and the post</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/697-3
02:14:49.528 --> 02:14:53.362
<v Josh Sparkes>not on the date,
not on the date you do register?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/698-0
02:14:54.442 --> 02:14:56.951
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so then the post event check was happened</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/698-1
02:14:56.951 --> 02:15:01.259
<v Josh Sparkes>so we didn't event happened or it might
have been cancelled actually might not</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/698-2
02:15:01.259 --> 02:15:04.204
<v Josh Sparkes>have even gone ahead.
So then the whole parent ticket</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/698-3
02:15:04.204 --> 02:15:08.349
<v Josh Sparkes>presumably is closed and complete or
there might be a reason that the event</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/698-4
02:15:08.349 --> 02:15:11.675
<v Josh Sparkes>was cancelled. Yeah,
there'll be the remainder confirmation,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/698-5
02:15:11.675 --> 02:15:13.202
<v Josh Sparkes>but it'll be a cancellation.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/699-0
02:15:13.842 --> 02:15:18.879
<v Josh Sparkes>Whether whatever it might you know,
we can have that root cause in the event</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/699-1
02:15:18.879 --> 02:15:22.935
<v Josh Sparkes>that it's gone ahead,
those post activities or do they follow</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/699-2
02:15:22.935 --> 02:15:25.682
<v Josh Sparkes>the same cycle, new whip review or a less?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/700-0
02:15:26.962 --> 02:15:32.909
<v Josh Sparkes>Stringent because it's a post event,
I can't remember what they were actually</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/700-1
02:15:32.909 --> 02:15:37.331
<v Josh Sparkes>on the phone call.
You discreetly put them on the screen.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/700-2
02:15:37.331 --> 02:15:41.905
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that all right? Usually.
Usually they do. It's just all.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/700-3
02:15:41.905 --> 02:15:44.802
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just thinking it's the whole call.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/701-0
02:15:46.522 --> 02:15:52.061
<v Josh Sparkes>If they want to set up a lot, yeah. OK.
They need to review it. OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/701-1
02:15:52.061 --> 02:15:56.134
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you want to share that in the team
chat? Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/701-2
02:15:56.134 --> 02:16:02.242
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just to get a sense of what what
requires? Review the review. OK, so.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/702-0
02:16:03.522 --> 02:16:09.084
<v Josh Sparkes>Are they tend to be so create follow up
that does have the vision that does have</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/702-1
02:16:09.084 --> 02:16:12.449
<v Josh Sparkes>the vision.
Is that one OK mark entrance in Mark</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/702-2
02:16:12.449 --> 02:16:15.470
<v Josh Sparkes>attendance mark attendance and
interaction.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/702-3
02:16:15.470 --> 02:16:20.482
<v Josh Sparkes>So that actually goes to the if it's got
CPA it goes to data management.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/703-0
02:16:21.762 --> 02:16:25.075
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's got CPD appoints,
it goes to data management.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/703-1
02:16:25.075 --> 02:16:29.554
<v Josh Sparkes>What does the CPD stand for? Sorry,
continuous professional development,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/703-2
02:16:29.554 --> 02:16:31.762
<v Josh Sparkes>continuous professional development.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/704-0
02:16:33.722 --> 02:16:33.842
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/707-0
02:16:43.322 --> 02:16:47.364
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, it's interesting,
the word continuous is in the front</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/707-1
02:16:47.364 --> 02:16:52.058
<v Josh Sparkes>because you think professional
development by the nature is continuous.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/707-2
02:16:52.058 --> 02:16:55.383
<v Josh Sparkes>So you do that. That's in Australia,
that happens.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/707-3
02:16:55.383 --> 02:17:00.402
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's for the APAC stages, OK,
that's the APAC, OK. So that's unique to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/708-0
02:17:00.962 --> 02:17:05.238
<v Josh Sparkes>To Australia. OK. I mean, it happens here,
but not in the same way,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/708-1
02:17:05.238 --> 02:17:09.200
<v Josh Sparkes>not in the same tracking. OK,
where's that information stored?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/708-2
02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:12.407
<v Josh Sparkes>How do you?
So you're you're creating that output,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/708-3
02:17:12.407 --> 02:17:15.802
<v Josh Sparkes>that artefact, that.
How do you get that information?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/709-0
02:17:17.202 --> 02:17:21.712
<v Josh Sparkes>From the events in the case of Australia,
from the events team,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/709-1
02:17:21.712 --> 02:17:26.857
<v Josh Sparkes>they give us the breakdown of.
Generally it's a spreadsheet and all that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/709-2
02:17:26.857 --> 02:17:31.155
<v Josh Sparkes>is a webinar output.
If you attended and then what? The CBD,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/709-3
02:17:31.155 --> 02:17:33.762
<v Josh Sparkes>what CBD points need to be allocated.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/710-0
02:17:34.082 --> 02:17:38.495
<v Josh Sparkes>So you allocate the CBD points to it. No,
we're told needs to be allocated.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/710-1
02:17:38.495 --> 02:17:41.399
<v Josh Sparkes>And where do you?
So you've got that information.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/710-2
02:17:41.399 --> 02:17:44.302
<v Josh Sparkes>Where do you then what?
What then gets populated?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/710-3
02:17:44.302 --> 02:17:48.715
<v Josh Sparkes>We then if it's got CPD attached to it,
it goes to data management and they</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/710-4
02:17:48.715 --> 02:17:52.082
<v Josh Sparkes>update interaction. OK.
Is that something therefore that?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/711-0
02:17:54.002 --> 02:17:58.682
<v Josh Sparkes>Also routed to data management without
you having to touch it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/712-0
02:18:00.242 --> 02:18:04.902
<v Josh Sparkes>Minus the Hong Kong.
I'm just wondering what you do with the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/712-1
02:18:04.902 --> 02:18:10.096
<v Josh Sparkes>data management are doing that,
but we have to do all the pre work.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/712-2
02:18:10.096 --> 02:18:16.282
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah, we compare the the spreadsheet.
Yeah, yeah, it's a spreadsheet formats.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/713-0
02:18:17.522 --> 02:18:22.605
<v Josh Sparkes>And is it something that they could
populate that therefore goes straight to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/713-1
02:18:22.605 --> 02:18:26.499
<v Josh Sparkes>data management?
I'm just questioning your network because</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/713-2
02:18:26.499 --> 02:18:30.592
<v Josh Sparkes>you know any other CPD events that's,
that's the the process.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/713-3
02:18:30.592 --> 02:18:35.938
<v Josh Sparkes>But then we support this particularly for
particular events called the Hong Kong</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/713-4
02:18:35.938 --> 02:18:36.202
<v Josh Sparkes>CPD.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/714-0
02:18:37.282 --> 02:18:41.663
<v Josh Sparkes>And that follow entirely different
process. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/714-1
02:18:41.663 --> 02:18:47.530
<v Josh Sparkes>So just to give you the output to to
populate that through data reporting,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/714-2
02:18:47.530 --> 02:18:53.162
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean is that where it's going to land
for all of these when it's CPD?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/715-0
02:18:53.602 --> 02:18:58.354
<v Josh Sparkes>Points. In the end, yes.
So so that's probably what I'm trying to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/715-1
02:18:58.354 --> 02:18:59.722
<v Josh Sparkes>get to is, are you?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/716-0
02:19:01.282 --> 02:19:05.212
<v Josh Sparkes>Why yourself in the middle?
If you're not doing the? I mean,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/716-1
02:19:05.212 --> 02:19:09.787
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe the spreadsheet for is this
something we give them that the post</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/716-2
02:19:09.787 --> 02:19:13.845
<v Josh Sparkes>event teams give and they give it
straight to data management?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/716-3
02:19:13.845 --> 02:19:15.842
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just sort of thinking what?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/717-0
02:19:16.362 --> 02:19:20.592
<v Josh Sparkes>Not not so. Give me for the language.
It's sort of 5:00 in the evening.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/717-1
02:19:20.592 --> 02:19:25.408
<v Josh Sparkes>Added value that your team are doing in
order to then give it to data management.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/717-2
02:19:25.408 --> 02:19:29.931
<v Josh Sparkes>So we're basically data cleansing in
order to then pass it back to the Asian</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/717-3
02:19:29.931 --> 02:19:31.282
<v Josh Sparkes>colleagues for them to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/718-0
02:19:31.922 --> 02:19:36.960
<v Josh Sparkes>Allocate because it's very regulated as
to the time that there's maybe Spain and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/718-1
02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:41.936
<v Josh Sparkes>a webinar as to whether they can actually
be allocated the full point for CPDS.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/718-2
02:19:41.936 --> 02:19:44.734
<v Josh Sparkes>So you're doing data cleansing part of
that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/718-3
02:19:44.734 --> 02:19:47.844
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's a data cleanse that goes back
to Asia.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/718-4
02:19:47.844 --> 02:19:51.762
<v Josh Sparkes>They give and allocate and then that goes
and will be the end.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/720-0
02:19:52.762 --> 02:19:58.548
<v Josh Sparkes>Part being this data management piece
then comes back because we've got the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/720-1
02:19:58.548 --> 02:20:02.888
<v Josh Sparkes>certificates, so it's the.
So the output actually is the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/720-2
02:20:02.888 --> 02:20:09.054
<v Josh Sparkes>certificates that then get distributed
and they come through yourself or they go</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/720-3
02:20:09.054 --> 02:20:11.642
<v Josh Sparkes>and they attach them and they say.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/721-0
02:20:11.762 --> 02:20:17.948
<v Josh Sparkes>Back to the original requester,
so they go to the the person that's</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/721-1
02:20:17.948 --> 02:20:22.315
<v Josh Sparkes>getting the point. Yeah, OK,
there's something.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/721-2
02:20:22.315 --> 02:20:27.682
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe we can explore about.
If they do the data cleansing.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/722-0
02:20:28.162 --> 02:20:33.390
<v Josh Sparkes>That whole process we've really tried to
automate, try and cut corners.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/722-1
02:20:33.390 --> 02:20:36.657
<v Josh Sparkes>It just does not work.
They're not on board.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/722-2
02:20:36.657 --> 02:20:40.651
<v Josh Sparkes>That seems so manual, doesn't it?
I just wonder again,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/722-3
02:20:40.651 --> 02:20:45.442
<v Josh Sparkes>is it maybe a parking lot item to that we
think I'd love to just.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/723-0
02:20:45.842 --> 02:20:50.347
<v Josh Sparkes>Stop that whole behaviour with time.
Nearest things and it's just a a brick</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/723-1
02:20:50.347 --> 02:20:55.148
<v Josh Sparkes>wall and it's follow the guide for what
I've given you. Stick to what I've said.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/723-2
02:20:55.148 --> 02:20:59.890
<v Josh Sparkes>That's pretty much what we get is this
from events from that's something we can</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/723-3
02:20:59.890 --> 02:21:00.482
<v Josh Sparkes>take as a.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/724-0
02:21:00.962 --> 02:21:05.443
<v Josh Sparkes>And I think it's because of the protected
nature of the Law Society,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/724-1
02:21:05.443 --> 02:21:09.339
<v Josh Sparkes>the importance of. Yeah, of course,
the gay and the output.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/724-2
02:21:09.339 --> 02:21:14.209
<v Josh Sparkes>We can't miss this because those points,
not just. Yes, the professionals.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/724-3
02:21:14.209 --> 02:21:18.559
<v Josh Sparkes>The professional points. Yeah.
When they actually get aligning the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/724-4
02:21:18.559 --> 02:21:20.442
<v Josh Sparkes>practises, which is actually.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/725-0
02:21:21.242 --> 02:21:24.989
<v Josh Sparkes>Sure that that's approved them to be a
lawyer. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/725-1
02:21:24.989 --> 02:21:30.387
<v Josh Sparkes>I want to see just importance. But for us,
it's like you're just making a clean stay</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/725-2
02:21:30.387 --> 02:21:33.181
<v Josh Sparkes>on.
And I did feel that you're just kind of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/725-3
02:21:33.181 --> 02:21:37.055
<v Josh Sparkes>dating, but it was just challenging.
White then lands a bit.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/725-4
02:21:37.055 --> 02:21:39.722
<v Josh Sparkes>Some of these white lands with the person.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/727-0
02:21:40.162 --> 02:21:42.175
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I think it was about it was it sat with</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/727-1
02:21:42.175 --> 02:21:44.319
<v Josh Sparkes>the function. So yeah,
they could sit and do it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/727-2
02:21:44.319 --> 02:21:46.725
<v Josh Sparkes>but then it's like, well,
from a function perspective,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/727-3
02:21:46.725 --> 02:21:49.962
<v Josh Sparkes>why should they sit and do that admin
activity when we could be doing it?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/728-0
02:21:52.002 --> 02:21:57.754
<v Josh Sparkes>When you say functions, you mean,
so that's his BMC. So yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/728-1
02:21:57.754 --> 02:22:05.082
<v Josh Sparkes>sorry because Asia do Joe rolls like they
do a mixture. So yeah, it's the BMC.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/729-0
02:22:10.922 --> 02:22:16.641
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. And then the UK differs,
you don't withdraw the park type as a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/729-1
02:22:16.641 --> 02:22:22.856
<v Josh Sparkes>whole. Oh, that was right. Yeah.
We're basically at the event managers and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/729-2
02:22:22.856 --> 02:22:24.762
<v Josh Sparkes>is that boundary whole?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/730-0
02:22:25.162 --> 02:22:29.119
<v Josh Sparkes>And we're looking at this whole process
end to end. Why? Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/730-1
02:22:29.119 --> 02:22:31.945
<v Josh Sparkes>with the event management project that
yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/730-2
02:22:31.945 --> 02:22:37.157
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe I think let's park it for just now,
we'll leave at the moment back and speak</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/730-3
02:22:37.157 --> 02:22:39.921
<v Josh Sparkes>with KR as well as tomorrow.
We need to be,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/730-4
02:22:39.921 --> 02:22:44.442
<v Josh Sparkes>I think everyone's probably gone now,
but just to make sure there's no.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/731-0
02:22:44.562 --> 02:22:50.018
<v Josh Sparkes>Overlapping anything like duplication or
just it's it's that if they should be</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/731-1
02:22:50.018 --> 02:22:53.747
<v Josh Sparkes>doing. I mean,
there's been some conversations say if</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/731-2
02:22:53.747 --> 02:22:57.684
<v Josh Sparkes>they should be doing it,
if it lies with them like event</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/731-3
02:22:57.684 --> 02:22:59.962
<v Josh Sparkes>management, your clients why are.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/732-0
02:23:00.602 --> 02:23:03.850
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's that whole workload. It's not.
Why not?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/732-1
02:23:03.850 --> 02:23:07.894
<v Josh Sparkes>So the problem is we have the
capabilities and the showroom,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/732-2
02:23:07.894 --> 02:23:13.263
<v Josh Sparkes>right and then you have the difference on
the other side of the world where they</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/732-3
02:23:13.263 --> 02:23:16.842
<v Josh Sparkes>want to have that control.
So APAC wants the control.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/733-0
02:23:17.242 --> 02:23:20.357
<v Josh Sparkes>Over here, they don't care.
So we've got the UK and Europe doing</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/733-1
02:23:20.357 --> 02:23:23.616
<v Josh Sparkes>whatever they like, running,
whatever events there is no structure.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/733-2
02:23:23.616 --> 02:23:25.916
<v Josh Sparkes>They tell us to run an event,
we run the event,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/733-3
02:23:25.916 --> 02:23:28.888
<v Josh Sparkes>we do all of the pre and post activity.
There is no briefing.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/733-4
02:23:28.888 --> 02:23:32.002
<v Josh Sparkes>There is no strategic alignment.
But which one is the right one?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/734-0
02:23:32.682 --> 02:23:36.877
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. And at the end of the day,
these points are critical, you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/734-1
02:23:36.877 --> 02:23:41.850
<v Josh Sparkes>but there has to be that if we're working
towards the global workflow of which you</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/734-2
02:23:41.850 --> 02:23:46.225
<v Josh Sparkes>can handle localised variations.
But this sounds like this is not even a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/734-3
02:23:46.225 --> 02:23:47.962
<v Josh Sparkes>globalised workflow. This is.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/735-0
02:23:48.802 --> 02:23:53.079
<v Josh Sparkes>Wild West West is nervous. You know,
I'm not, I'm guessing. But I mean,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/735-1
02:23:53.079 --> 02:23:56.880
<v Josh Sparkes>it should. Maybe if it needs to sit,
sit with event management.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/735-2
02:23:56.880 --> 02:24:00.443
<v Josh Sparkes>It sits with them.
So not the current agreed responsibility</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/735-3
02:24:00.443 --> 02:24:04.957
<v Josh Sparkes>lies with the events team that the
current approved process and how this is</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/735-4
02:24:04.957 --> 02:24:08.282
<v Josh Sparkes>all weighed out is the way that I've just
explained it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/736-0
02:24:08.362 --> 02:24:12.396
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, from an APAC perspective,
that's how it should work and what has</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/736-1
02:24:12.396 --> 02:24:15.350
<v Josh Sparkes>been agreed.
So we thought the workflow captures of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/736-2
02:24:15.350 --> 02:24:19.212
<v Josh Sparkes>how it should work and that's the evening
for the UK to match epac,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/736-3
02:24:19.212 --> 02:24:23.586
<v Josh Sparkes>is that what you're not working on?
Not necessarily because there's elements</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/736-4
02:24:23.586 --> 02:24:24.722
<v Josh Sparkes>as part of the APAC.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/737-0
02:24:25.522 --> 02:24:30.229
<v Josh Sparkes>That is quite rigid.
Then it's a lot of back and forth,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/737-1
02:24:30.229 --> 02:24:34.515
<v Josh Sparkes>but we can capture the ones that are UK
localised,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/737-2
02:24:34.515 --> 02:24:40.482
<v Josh Sparkes>but in overall it is a event pre activity
event post activity and the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/738-0
02:24:40.922 --> 02:24:45.726
<v Josh Sparkes>Artefact is artefact,
is those CPD points that still apply to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/738-1
02:24:45.726 --> 02:24:49.599
<v Josh Sparkes>the UK.
They still get their personal development</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/738-2
02:24:49.599 --> 02:24:53.783
<v Josh Sparkes>not listed.
The only way it's listed on CPD in the UK</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/738-3
02:24:53.783 --> 02:24:55.642
<v Josh Sparkes>is through learning hub.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/739-0
02:24:56.362 --> 02:24:58.635
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so we get their points for being a lawyer</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/739-1
02:24:58.635 --> 02:25:02.142
<v Josh Sparkes>in a different way. Yeah. OK.
So they get their points to the way they</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/739-2
02:25:02.142 --> 02:25:05.204
<v Josh Sparkes>they do their practising stuff where it's
all evidence based.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/739-3
02:25:05.204 --> 02:25:09.107
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not a point based. No problem. No,
it is. It's something like that. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/739-4
02:25:09.107 --> 02:25:11.922
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like a statement.
They have to write as opposed to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/740-0
02:25:13.402 --> 02:25:16.994
<v Josh Sparkes>Point based.
It's all point based and how they cap how</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/740-1
02:25:16.994 --> 02:25:21.043
<v Josh Sparkes>they get that qualification has to come
from different means.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/740-2
02:25:21.043 --> 02:25:26.528
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's like only five of the 20 is that
they have can only be done online or five.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/740-3
02:25:26.528 --> 02:25:30.642
<v Josh Sparkes>Five of those points can then only be
done by like e-learning.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/741-0
02:25:31.322 --> 02:25:35.363
<v Josh Sparkes>But there's no point.
There's structure that it's point to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/741-1
02:25:35.363 --> 02:25:40.362
<v Josh Sparkes>qualify to be a lawyer. Yeah. Yeah.
On APAC. Yeah, but not UKUK is that?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/742-0
02:25:40.602 --> 02:25:40.762
<v Josh Sparkes>No.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/743-0
02:25:42.642 --> 02:25:46.314
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's a worthy of CPA team.
Sorry.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/743-1
02:25:46.314 --> 02:25:53.157
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll just be all thinking of tomorrow,
Mark. And that was OK. You captured that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/743-2
02:25:53.157 --> 02:25:59.082
<v Josh Sparkes>You got that gist of that whole end to
end workflows to be globalised.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/744-0
02:25:59.562 --> 02:25:59.682
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/745-0
02:26:00.762 --> 02:26:01.802
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, well.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/746-0
02:26:01.642 --> 02:26:05.642
<v Josh Sparkes>To the well, I know it's 5:00.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/752-0
02:26:05.842 --> 02:26:11.058
<v Mark Sedge>I certainly I certainly got it. It's the,
it's the amount of batten hat batten hat,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/752-1
02:26:11.058 --> 02:26:14.287
<v Mark Sedge>you know,
passing so whether it's necessary or not,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/748-0
02:26:12.802 --> 02:26:12.922
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/752-2
02:26:14.287 --> 02:26:19.379
<v Mark Sedge>whether there's something that could be
done slicker, it's it's difficult to say,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/749-0
02:26:15.122 --> 02:26:15.242
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/750-0
02:26:16.282 --> 02:26:16.802
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/752-3
02:26:19.379 --> 02:26:20.682
<v Mark Sedge>but yes, followed it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/751-0
02:26:21.642 --> 02:26:21.882
<v Josh Sparkes>Hmm.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/753-0
02:26:30.682 --> 02:26:37.461
<v Josh Sparkes>Events management. OK,
so they're all hosted events association</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/753-1
02:26:37.461 --> 02:26:38.202
<v Josh Sparkes>events.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/754-0
02:26:39.162 --> 02:26:43.971
<v Josh Sparkes>Clients to recapture that one earlier.
Are they different or do they fall into</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/754-1
02:26:43.971 --> 02:26:47.075
<v Josh Sparkes>that same realm of oh, no,
that's that's research.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/754-2
02:26:47.075 --> 02:26:51.457
<v Josh Sparkes>That's one that we did. Yeah,
we've done that. That's that's not. It's.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/754-3
02:26:51.457 --> 02:26:54.682
<v Josh Sparkes>No, that one.
It's more than it's research. So it's.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/755-0
02:26:55.962 --> 02:27:02.059
<v Josh Sparkes>Research. Yeah, we we search for events,
but it's ******* not an event. OK?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/755-1
02:27:02.059 --> 02:27:08.395
<v Josh Sparkes>Correct minded confirmation follow-ups
there was that post event activity that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/755-2
02:27:08.395 --> 02:27:11.042
<v Josh Sparkes>we talked about if we go up bits.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/756-0
02:27:12.242 --> 02:27:16.778
<v Josh Sparkes>Confirmation current awards
administration on OK, OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/756-1
02:27:16.778 --> 02:27:23.414
<v Josh Sparkes>National Current awards request speaker
as was that was part of the checklist.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/756-2
02:27:23.414 --> 02:27:29.042
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah. OK. So that's the event.
And we're actually trying to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/757-0
02:27:30.082 --> 02:27:30.242
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/758-0
02:27:32.642 --> 02:27:37.346
<v Josh Sparkes>There's one last topic,
if you face it or whether you would like</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/758-1
02:27:37.346 --> 02:27:42.122
<v Josh Sparkes>to use other and you're probably is
reporting, but you might say.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/760-0
02:27:44.362 --> 02:27:49.386
<v Josh Sparkes>We could always do an additional workshop
or do they tend to maybe we could start</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/760-1
02:27:49.386 --> 02:27:54.287
<v Josh Sparkes>it in the sense that do they tend to come
in as queries reports should they lie</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/760-2
02:27:54.287 --> 02:27:58.943
<v Josh Sparkes>with you to at least so you've got client
reporting and internal reporting.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/760-3
02:27:58.943 --> 02:28:02.802
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that correct? Emily,
is this the reporting that you put in?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/761-0
02:28:03.682 --> 02:28:08.809
<v Josh Sparkes>In the Channel client reporting that
Mandy does and is this different?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/761-1
02:28:08.809 --> 02:28:13.718
<v Josh Sparkes>This is what I can see here.
Is quite an important client reporting</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/761-2
02:28:13.718 --> 02:28:18.122
<v Josh Sparkes>league tables internal.
What did I say with client internal?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/762-0
02:28:18.602 --> 02:28:19.722
<v Josh Sparkes>Big tables.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/763-0
02:28:24.162 --> 02:28:29.073
<v Josh Sparkes>Not many more so that one doesn't do
which one doesn't happen and then client</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/763-1
02:28:29.073 --> 02:28:34.173
<v Josh Sparkes>reporting. And so you've got your G21.
Suppose you've got your client reporting.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/763-2
02:28:34.173 --> 02:28:38.642
<v Josh Sparkes>So which one doesn't happen?
Which one were we on? Oh, gosh, that one.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/764-0
02:28:39.802 --> 02:28:42.987
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, the worst one,
this is maybe not talk to,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/764-1
02:28:42.987 --> 02:28:47.765
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just maybe we'll talk to.
So you have the three types of reporting</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/764-2
02:28:47.765 --> 02:28:53.338
<v Josh Sparkes>clients. So you've got client reporting,
yeah, your G20 client reporting G20. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/764-3
02:28:53.338 --> 02:28:56.722
<v Josh Sparkes>internal reporting. Yeah.
And then the new tables.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/765-0
02:28:57.882 --> 02:29:01.242
<v Josh Sparkes>And they all come in PR reporting,
PR reporting.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/766-0
02:29:05.202 --> 02:29:09.878
<v Josh Sparkes>Social media. Misha, sorry,
you do do that. Do you? Do so.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/766-1
02:29:09.878 --> 02:29:13.602
<v Josh Sparkes>Client does all of those as a global
function.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/767-0
02:29:16.122 --> 02:29:19.842
<v Josh Sparkes>Not week tables, not week.
That is UK only.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/768-0
02:29:21.402 --> 02:29:26.659
<v Josh Sparkes>The one we intend to get rid of,
it's the one you tend to get.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/768-1
02:29:26.659 --> 02:29:30.330
<v Josh Sparkes>You want to get rid of and pass it
through.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/768-2
02:29:30.330 --> 02:29:37.255
<v Josh Sparkes>Line needs to be gone completely or given
to back to CMG given back given back the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/768-3
02:29:37.255 --> 02:29:37.922
<v Josh Sparkes>kickers.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/769-0
02:29:38.922 --> 02:29:42.799
<v Josh Sparkes>Did you want to?
I don't want to get to a point where</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/769-1
02:29:42.799 --> 02:29:48.829
<v Josh Sparkes>everyone falls over and you can't take in
anymore. It's been a long day, hasn't it?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/769-2
02:29:48.829 --> 02:29:53.567
<v Josh Sparkes>We've gone whether we can offline,
pick up client reporting what?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/769-3
02:29:53.567 --> 02:29:55.002
<v Josh Sparkes>You just want to do?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/770-0
02:29:55.522 --> 02:29:59.036
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, I'm I'm happy to read the room.
Everyone's on it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/770-1
02:29:59.036 --> 02:30:02.973
<v Josh Sparkes>It's dark and that whether we pick that
up as a separates. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/770-2
02:30:02.973 --> 02:30:06.789
<v Josh Sparkes>we do a follow up call.
Quick one in the next couple of weeks.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/770-3
02:30:06.789 --> 02:30:10.665
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, if you're about that,
would you prefer that or is there a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/770-4
02:30:10.665 --> 02:30:12.482
<v Josh Sparkes>utopia, this is what new whip?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/771-0
02:30:13.122 --> 02:30:16.196
<v Josh Sparkes>Different reports?
Or is there a form in the very first</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/771-1
02:30:16.196 --> 02:30:19.050
<v Josh Sparkes>instance?
Is there a form that they create today to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/771-2
02:30:19.050 --> 02:30:22.343
<v Josh Sparkes>give you client reports?
There is a form OK that we have to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/771-3
02:30:22.343 --> 02:30:26.021
<v Josh Sparkes>complete on their behalf to send to
reporting to get the financial</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/771-4
02:30:26.021 --> 02:30:27.722
<v Josh Sparkes>information for client reports.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/772-0
02:30:29.242 --> 02:30:32.042
<v Josh Sparkes>So it comes in to you from who?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/773-0
02:30:33.642 --> 02:30:39.632
<v Josh Sparkes>Or is this something you're creating
internally? Strategic accounts manager?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/773-1
02:30:39.632 --> 02:30:43.210
<v Josh Sparkes>Strategic accounts manager? Yes. Yeah,
sorry.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/773-2
02:30:43.210 --> 02:30:49.122
<v Josh Sparkes>So do they tend to be your requesters for
these client reports? The ad hoc.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/774-0
02:30:52.122 --> 02:30:55.051
<v Josh Sparkes>Next,
a mixture of I talk and scheduled pieces.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/774-1
02:30:55.051 --> 02:30:59.627
<v Josh Sparkes>So the scheduled ones a bit like we said
before could be in your calendars</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/774-2
02:30:59.627 --> 02:31:02.617
<v Josh Sparkes>activities.
And so when you receive the layer of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/774-3
02:31:02.617 --> 02:31:06.705
<v Josh Sparkes>probably going to reporting now.
But I just thought you've got the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/774-4
02:31:06.705 --> 02:31:08.962
<v Josh Sparkes>standard form that they can complete.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/775-0
02:31:09.002 --> 02:31:12.588
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that correct?
I want this for this client. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/775-1
02:31:12.588 --> 02:31:17.277
<v Josh Sparkes>here's the selection of what I want in
financials requirements. OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/775-2
02:31:17.277 --> 02:31:22.793
<v Josh Sparkes>why do you complete it on their behalf?
Thank you. That's an advantage. I mean,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/775-3
02:31:22.793 --> 02:31:23.482
<v Josh Sparkes>that is a.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/777-0
02:31:23.002 --> 02:31:27.395
<v Mark Sedge>I was going to ask that I was going to
ask this self same question then why?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/776-0
02:31:24.322 --> 02:31:24.602
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/777-1
02:31:27.395 --> 02:31:32.072
<v Mark Sedge>Why can't they just do it themselves for
and present and answer all the questions</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/778-0
02:31:28.962 --> 02:31:33.344
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, they don't want. Yeah,
they don't know what they want. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/777-2
02:31:32.072 --> 02:31:32.642
<v Mark Sedge>you'd ask.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/778-1
02:31:33.344 --> 02:31:37.921
<v Josh Sparkes>they don't always available.
That's a good manager article. That's a.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/778-2
02:31:37.921 --> 02:31:41.452
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a chance for changes.
We have to get starting.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/778-3
02:31:41.452 --> 02:31:44.002
<v Josh Sparkes>I know it's easier said than done, but.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/779-0
02:31:44.562 --> 02:31:48.167
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, maybe capture it as a change?
Absolutely, but but their query?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/779-1
02:31:48.167 --> 02:31:50.570
<v Josh Sparkes>They want that from the reporting team.
Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/779-2
02:31:50.570 --> 02:31:54.697
<v Josh Sparkes>So the information that find that a lot
of what we request for client or comes</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/779-3
02:31:54.697 --> 02:31:59.138
<v Josh Sparkes>from the. So we're working with the team,
we can build the data based on parameters.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/779-4
02:31:59.138 --> 02:32:01.802
<v Josh Sparkes>We then build the report based on the
information.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/780-0
02:32:03.082 --> 02:32:10.482
<v Josh Sparkes>Not that I'm passing that your workloads
got. Could reporting do the reporting?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/781-0
02:32:12.282 --> 02:32:16.788
<v Josh Sparkes>They could do the reporting.
Could they do the report report in a way</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/781-1
02:32:16.788 --> 02:32:21.165
<v Josh Sparkes>that the client experience?
Could they do the initial because we've</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/781-2
02:32:21.165 --> 02:32:24.255
<v Josh Sparkes>got reporting this week as the initial
request?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/781-3
02:32:24.255 --> 02:32:27.602
<v Josh Sparkes>Could it be that I think your mic's gone
on? Hello.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/783-0
02:32:25.962 --> 02:32:31.179
<v Mark Sedge>So this this sorry this feel this feels
again that you've got a team that are not</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/782-0
02:32:28.922 --> 02:32:29.202
<v Josh Sparkes>Hold on.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/783-1
02:32:31.179 --> 02:32:35.823
<v Mark Sedge>able to deliver appropriate quality and
you're wiping her bums for them.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/783-2
02:32:35.823 --> 02:32:37.922
<v Mark Sedge>Sorry for for the bluntness that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/784-0
02:32:39.762 --> 02:32:42.362
<v Mark Sedge>But but sorry, sorry for the.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/786-0
02:32:43.522 --> 02:32:46.082
<v Josh Sparkes>So it could be maybe just.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/787-0
02:32:45.082 --> 02:32:47.362
<v Mark Sedge>Is is that a fair reflection?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/788-0
02:32:47.642 --> 02:32:50.815
<v Josh Sparkes>I think by the facial expressions in the
room,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/788-1
02:32:50.815 --> 02:32:55.471
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you've so it could be when we
discussed reporting this week,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/788-2
02:32:55.471 --> 02:32:59.318
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be the request comes into them.
They create it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/788-3
02:32:59.318 --> 02:33:04.650
<v Josh Sparkes>there's some cases where that already
happened and then you get it in and then</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/788-4
02:33:04.650 --> 02:33:07.282
<v Josh Sparkes>it's passed on to you to format I mean.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/789-0
02:33:07.482 --> 02:33:11.744
<v Josh Sparkes>It will be part of their remit as well,
but for you format it for the client</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/789-1
02:33:11.744 --> 02:33:15.452
<v Josh Sparkes>specific look and feel,
but the actual heavy lifting of reporting,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/789-2
02:33:15.452 --> 02:33:18.163
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean losing the name could sit with
reporting.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/789-3
02:33:18.163 --> 02:33:22.424
<v Josh Sparkes>Could they go down a little report and
report and do what you need to do and</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/789-4
02:33:22.424 --> 02:33:25.800
<v Josh Sparkes>then send it to you.
So really you don't need to be involved</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/789-5
02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:26.962
<v Josh Sparkes>at the start as well.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/790-0
02:33:27.282 --> 02:33:31.708
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just saying. Yeah. So the trigger.
Yeah. The trigger comes into report.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/790-1
02:33:31.708 --> 02:33:35.493
<v Josh Sparkes>They do the report and you make it pretty
for the clients. Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/790-2
02:33:35.493 --> 02:33:39.802
<v Josh Sparkes>we're related in the rate format. Yeah,
because we're we're proposing to.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/791-0
02:33:44.642 --> 02:33:50.244
<v Josh Sparkes>We're we're we're. Well, we. Yeah.
So one thing that to note on that is data</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/791-1
02:33:50.244 --> 02:33:56.209
<v Josh Sparkes>accuracy is where it also comes back to
that. I know about the name of the Aflac.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/791-2
02:33:56.209 --> 02:33:57.882
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you check the data?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/792-0
02:33:58.202 --> 02:34:03.202
<v Josh Sparkes>Accuracy or reporting should know
reporting to get us the rate and it just</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/792-1
02:34:03.202 --> 02:34:08.536
<v Josh Sparkes>sounds that it's the initial entry points.
It's with them and then based on the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/792-2
02:34:08.536 --> 02:34:12.936
<v Josh Sparkes>clients it is then the client reporting
it's fed to yourself. OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/792-3
02:34:12.936 --> 02:34:14.802
<v Josh Sparkes>so then I think about it as.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/793-0
02:34:15.842 --> 02:34:21.377
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it because we have the discussion to
flesh out what they actually need?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/793-1
02:34:21.377 --> 02:34:26.100
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's the part and the knowledge
that report doesn't have.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/793-2
02:34:26.100 --> 02:34:31.339
<v Josh Sparkes>So the client reports always have.
So the client one they like it in a</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/793-3
02:34:31.339 --> 02:34:32.962
<v Josh Sparkes>certain look and feel.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/794-0
02:34:34.392 --> 02:34:39.537
<v Josh Sparkes>And client to why? What?
What's the variation on why your client</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/794-1
02:34:39.537 --> 02:34:45.078
<v Josh Sparkes>might like cater driven by reporting?
It can come from other aspects.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/794-2
02:34:45.078 --> 02:34:49.272
<v Josh Sparkes>If you don't do such other systems.
So so basically.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/795-0
02:34:50.082 --> 02:34:55.130
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you're talking about the client
relationship reports, yes,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/795-1
02:34:55.130 --> 02:34:59.725
<v Josh Sparkes>and not the specific for G20. Yeah.
So it is different form.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/795-2
02:34:59.725 --> 02:35:04.320
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what you require.
So for like the client relationship</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/795-3
02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:04.922
<v Josh Sparkes>reports.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/796-0
02:35:05.642 --> 02:35:12.664
<v Josh Sparkes>They pull information from different
teams. For example, yeah, like financials.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/796-1
02:35:12.664 --> 02:35:17.929
<v Josh Sparkes>We we got them from reporting and for
some IDB information,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/796-2
02:35:17.929 --> 02:35:20.562
<v Josh Sparkes>we reach out to the IDB teams.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/797-0
02:35:21.802 --> 02:35:24.968
<v Josh Sparkes>So go on then.
Sometimes they reach out to the ask</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/799-0
02:35:24.042 --> 02:35:28.457
<v Mark Sedge>Are they, Mandy? Quick, Mandy,
quick question for are these are these of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/797-1
02:35:24.968 --> 02:35:25.402
<v Josh Sparkes>people.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/799-1
02:35:28.457 --> 02:35:33.173
<v Mark Sedge>similar structure and nature of type,
so you could almost say it's a type one</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/799-2
02:35:33.173 --> 02:35:36.076
<v Mark Sedge>type 2,
type 3 or are they different every time</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/798-0
02:35:36.002 --> 02:35:36.122
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/799-3
02:35:36.076 --> 02:35:39.522
<v Mark Sedge>and you guys have to gather the
requirements every time?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/800-0
02:35:37.602 --> 02:35:40.562
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what.
That's what we that's what we were</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/800-1
02:35:40.562 --> 02:35:44.693
<v Josh Sparkes>landing on. Is if it was the type,
what that structure looks like.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/800-2
02:35:44.693 --> 02:35:48.331
<v Josh Sparkes>So that reporting again could take a
heavy lift. You know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/800-3
02:35:48.331 --> 02:35:53.202
<v Josh Sparkes>it doesn't need to even come back to
yourself to make that look look and feel.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/801-0
02:35:54.642 --> 02:35:57.632
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, this is probably,
I know we said we wouldn't get into</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/801-1
02:35:57.632 --> 02:36:00.719
<v Josh Sparkes>reporting, we would park it,
but it certainly sounds like we've</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/801-2
02:36:00.719 --> 02:36:03.998
<v Josh Sparkes>uncovered the initial request go to
reporting because they have the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/801-3
02:36:03.998 --> 02:36:07.712
<v Josh Sparkes>information and that data accuracy
because if you don't do anything with it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/801-4
02:36:07.712 --> 02:36:11.618
<v Josh Sparkes>then I should request apart from send it
on to report and there's no really need</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/801-5
02:36:11.618 --> 02:36:13.402
<v Josh Sparkes>to involve you at that point exactly.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/802-0
02:36:14.002 --> 02:36:14.682
<v Josh Sparkes>It's understandable.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/805-0
02:36:17.482 --> 02:36:22.041
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So Emily can sorry, I misheard,
but are you you're doing the fine tuning</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/805-1
02:36:22.041 --> 02:36:25.331
<v Mark Sedge>of the requirements, aren't you?
And then you're making,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/803-0
02:36:25.082 --> 02:36:26.082
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, yes.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/805-2
02:36:25.331 --> 02:36:29.947
<v Mark Sedge>and then you're making sure that what is
delivered aligns to those requirements</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/805-3
02:36:29.947 --> 02:36:32.082
<v Mark Sedge>and is a good level of quality, yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/804-0
02:36:30.122 --> 02:36:30.242
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/806-0
02:36:33.482 --> 02:36:36.918
<v Josh Sparkes>More than fine tuning,
we obtain the actual requirement from the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/806-1
02:36:36.918 --> 02:36:39.296
<v Josh Sparkes>request. Yeah.
So that's the first briefing.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/806-2
02:36:39.296 --> 02:36:42.890
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a conversation that happens with
the the Sam to understand.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/806-3
02:36:42.890 --> 02:36:45.321
<v Josh Sparkes>What are we trying to deliver for the
client?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/806-4
02:36:45.321 --> 02:36:49.602
<v Josh Sparkes>But couldn't that be a part of a request
form that could be part of the initial?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/807-0
02:36:50.282 --> 02:36:54.659
<v Josh Sparkes>The requester could be led to get those
requirements.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/807-1
02:36:54.659 --> 02:37:00.170
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean that that's the big change piece.
Yeah, I think it's a sign.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/807-2
02:37:00.170 --> 02:37:05.842
<v Josh Sparkes>I think all our minds are dying.
Everybody. So, yeah, sorry, I think.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/808-0
02:37:10.282 --> 02:37:14.170
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the quick point I wanted to make
is I think there's an education piece in</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/808-1
02:37:14.170 --> 02:37:18.104
<v Josh Sparkes>general like it's similar to the PE Group,
how they use billing or how what to put</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/808-2
02:37:18.104 --> 02:37:21.991
<v Josh Sparkes>on, what to remove. I think it's similar.
How do you articulate what you actually</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/808-3
02:37:21.991 --> 02:37:24.219
<v Josh Sparkes>want?
So irrespective of whether they speak to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/808-4
02:37:24.219 --> 02:37:27.442
<v Josh Sparkes>you or whether they speak to the
reporting team, it shouldn't make.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/809-0
02:37:27.482 --> 02:37:30.905
<v Josh Sparkes>The difference,
like your request is your request,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/809-1
02:37:30.905 --> 02:37:35.938
<v Josh Sparkes>but if you're teasing it out with them,
there's clearly something missing.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/809-2
02:37:35.938 --> 02:37:40.032
<v Josh Sparkes>I think. I think as we said,
we wouldn't get into reporting.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/809-3
02:37:40.032 --> 02:37:41.642
<v Josh Sparkes>There's probably a good.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/811-0
02:37:43.722 --> 02:37:47.273
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
I think that's probably should we take</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/811-1
02:37:47.273 --> 02:37:51.815
<v Josh Sparkes>that? Should we take that as a a next?
Yeah. Yeah. OK.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/811-2
02:37:51.815 --> 02:37:56.522
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a good place to stop. Yep.
But I think we've got.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/813-0
02:37:59.202 --> 02:38:02.068
<v Josh Sparkes>They can't belong out,
so you might have I I can.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/813-1
02:38:02.068 --> 02:38:05.908
<v Josh Sparkes>What I'm saying is the different
reporting categories here are all</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/812-0
02:38:03.722 --> 02:38:03.962
<v Mark Sedge>S.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/813-2
02:38:05.908 --> 02:38:08.602
<v Josh Sparkes>different.
And then we also have the quarterly</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/813-3
02:38:08.602 --> 02:38:12.556
<v Josh Sparkes>reporting and then 10 on reporting.
But we need to cover up to that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/813-4
02:38:12.556 --> 02:38:14.562
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have those categories we can.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/814-0
02:38:15.722 --> 02:38:19.589
<v Josh Sparkes>Streamline the as you said,
client G20 clients internal and then we</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/814-1
02:38:19.589 --> 02:38:23.000
<v Josh Sparkes>can have that conversation and some are
easier than others.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/814-2
02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:27.264
<v Josh Sparkes>The client reporting is not one,
but it sounds certainly is an opportunity</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/814-3
02:38:27.264 --> 02:38:30.618
<v Josh Sparkes>to if the people doing the reporting are
doing the report,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/814-4
02:38:30.618 --> 02:38:33.347
<v Josh Sparkes>it goes to reporting you know,
get that change.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/814-5
02:38:33.347 --> 02:38:34.882
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm all up for that change.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/815-0
02:38:35.282 --> 02:38:38.274
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
it's maybe 11 worth having a discussion</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/815-1
02:38:38.274 --> 02:38:41.136
<v Josh Sparkes>with reporting.
We talked to them on those,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/815-2
02:38:41.136 --> 02:38:46.143
<v Josh Sparkes>so we'll introduce that conversation.
I think some of them already are male,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/815-3
02:38:46.143 --> 02:38:51.216
<v Josh Sparkes>so some of them do start with reporting
and they don't touch us or they start</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/815-4
02:38:51.216 --> 02:38:54.402
<v Josh Sparkes>there and do come to us.
So that's the G20 ones.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/816-0
02:38:55.922 --> 02:38:59.809
<v Josh Sparkes>And not so much.
The client reports where it's just ad hoc</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/816-1
02:38:59.809 --> 02:39:03.235
<v Josh Sparkes>like I want a bank.
I'm just thinking Kevin's ones,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/816-2
02:39:03.235 --> 02:39:08.374
<v Josh Sparkes>like the bank industry for a particular
client that goes to us to liaise with</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/816-3
02:39:08.374 --> 02:39:12.261
<v Josh Sparkes>reporting. OK. OK.
So we're seeing a bit of data, you see,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/816-4
02:39:12.261 --> 02:39:13.842
<v Josh Sparkes>where is it coming from?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/817-0
02:39:14.282 --> 02:39:18.084
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, reporting like,
where are they getting it?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/817-1
02:39:18.084 --> 02:39:24.601
<v Josh Sparkes>All the different sources or whatever the
every workshop about the single source of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/817-2
02:39:24.601 --> 02:39:30.031
<v Josh Sparkes>truth? Accuracy. Yeah, it's not.
Or what's being pulled. They're not.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/817-3
02:39:30.031 --> 02:39:33.522
<v Josh Sparkes>And I think we've got the data like
objects.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/818-0
02:39:34.162 --> 02:39:38.391
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it's a couple of years away. Yeah,
there's a data link project to address.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/818-1
02:39:38.391 --> 02:39:41.105
<v Josh Sparkes>Not that.
So we are we are proposing for reports in</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/818-2
02:39:41.105 --> 02:39:45.073
<v Josh Sparkes>a much more user friendly service where
through the form if they don't know</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/818-3
02:39:45.073 --> 02:39:48.361
<v Josh Sparkes>exactly what they want,
we're trying to guide them towards it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/818-4
02:39:48.361 --> 02:39:50.762
<v Josh Sparkes>So that is part of the reporting work
stream.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/819-0
02:39:51.162 --> 02:39:55.474
<v Josh Sparkes>We're trying to do that might help a bit
there. So go through that,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/819-1
02:39:55.474 --> 02:40:00.292
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe I'll find things on Thursday.
We can then set another remote workshop</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/819-2
02:40:00.292 --> 02:40:04.286
<v Josh Sparkes>with you for person,
whichever suits whatever you found useful</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/819-3
02:40:04.286 --> 02:40:06.885
<v Josh Sparkes>today,
and then we can feedback and then</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/819-4
02:40:06.885 --> 02:40:10.562
<v Josh Sparkes>continue that. Yeah,
it's important that we get it right.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/820-0
02:40:10.642 --> 02:40:13.769
<v Josh Sparkes>And obviously it's it's been a long day
for everyone.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/820-1
02:40:13.769 --> 02:40:18.633
<v Josh Sparkes>So just to make sure everyone is focused,
if it's OK if we leave it and we can pick</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/820-2
02:40:18.633 --> 02:40:21.239
<v Josh Sparkes>it,
I mean it kind of it's kind of good time</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/820-3
02:40:21.239 --> 02:40:25.293
<v Josh Sparkes>because we do have reporting on Thursday
as well. We'll get by Wayne,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/820-4
02:40:25.293 --> 02:40:26.682
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe we will do things.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/821-0
02:40:28.642 --> 02:40:33.396
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, he's happy with that.
Is that OK for me? Parking. Lotta. Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/821-1
02:40:33.396 --> 02:40:34.842
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you, everybody.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/822-0
02:40:37.482 --> 02:40:38.962
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you want to do something else?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/824-0
02:40:40.562 --> 02:40:45.002
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
we've just got some for your information</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/824-1
02:40:45.002 --> 02:40:51.424
<v Josh Sparkes>slides, there's no more heavy lifting.
I I swear. So just some FYI,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/824-2
02:40:51.424 --> 02:40:55.202
<v Josh Sparkes>look like 9:15 that slide 8 hours later.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/825-0
02:40:55.962 --> 02:40:59.115
<v Josh Sparkes>Reports and dashboards and we spoke a
little bit about it.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/825-1
02:40:59.115 --> 02:41:03.283
<v Josh Sparkes>We I think we'll be able to draw some
things that should be some good reports</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/825-2
02:41:03.283 --> 02:41:05.688
<v Josh Sparkes>for you guys.
But over the the coming weeks,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/825-3
02:41:05.688 --> 02:41:09.802
<v Josh Sparkes>if things come to mind that you would
like a specific reports capture those.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/826-0
02:41:11.802 --> 02:41:11.922
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/827-0
02:41:13.042 --> 02:41:16.963
<v Josh Sparkes>I think I did that. Yeah.
I shared the quarterly reporting that we</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/827-1
02:41:16.963 --> 02:41:21.235
<v Josh Sparkes>do and delivered to stakeholders and
stuck it in the team's channel. Oh,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/827-2
02:41:21.235 --> 02:41:24.161
<v Josh Sparkes>perfect.
It's probably not on the right location,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/827-3
02:41:24.161 --> 02:41:28.666
<v Josh Sparkes>but I'll have a search. Thank you.
I can catch it, teamly. But to move just.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/827-4
02:41:28.666 --> 02:41:32.762
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, if there's nothing in there,
just let us know when we can move.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/828-0
02:41:32.962 --> 02:41:37.704
<v Josh Sparkes>I can't even remember if I changed or not.
That's great. Yeah. And knowledge wise,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/828-1
02:41:37.704 --> 02:41:40.217
<v Josh Sparkes>can we spoke a little bit about this
today,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/828-2
02:41:40.217 --> 02:41:44.673
<v Josh Sparkes>what we can put for users up front to
help them solve their own things first.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/828-3
02:41:44.673 --> 02:41:47.757
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can capture what we've talked about.
But again,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/828-4
02:41:47.757 --> 02:41:49.642
<v Josh Sparkes>if there's any other things that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/829-0
02:41:50.042 --> 02:41:53.776
<v Josh Sparkes>You think over the next few weeks
following this discussion,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/829-1
02:41:53.776 --> 02:41:58.121
<v Josh Sparkes>you can throw them in a yeah,
channel the information that you want or</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/829-2
02:41:58.121 --> 02:42:03.017
<v Josh Sparkes>to cut it off that pushes it back. Yeah.
But we've got some from today as well.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/829-3
02:42:03.017 --> 02:42:06.077
<v Josh Sparkes>That's useful.
We're going to be doing user story</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/829-4
02:42:06.077 --> 02:42:08.402
<v Josh Sparkes>writing over the next couple of weeks.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/830-0
02:42:08.482 --> 02:42:13.661
<v Josh Sparkes>And you guys will have visibility of
everything before we put it in to build.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/830-1
02:42:13.661 --> 02:42:19.040
<v Josh Sparkes>So you think I mentioned earlier a long
time ago that you'll be able to see that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/830-2
02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:23.887
<v Josh Sparkes>and just some next dates I think here.
Can I just check on annual leave?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/830-3
02:42:23.887 --> 02:42:28.202
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm aware of Monday's leave,
did that come back mail from these?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/831-0
02:42:28.442 --> 02:42:28.962
<v Josh Sparkes>Back.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/832-0
02:42:30.322 --> 02:42:33.298
<v Josh Sparkes>Around availability and user stories and
support for that,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/832-1
02:42:33.298 --> 02:42:37.182
<v Josh Sparkes>I've personally not heard anything.
Whether Joe has it or not, I'm not sure,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/832-2
02:42:37.182 --> 02:42:41.166
<v Josh Sparkes>but obviously we put a message in the
channel for everyone to update an annual</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/832-3
02:42:41.166 --> 02:42:45.251
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail. We saw that you've done that,
so we'll pick it up. Don't worry that now,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/832-4
02:42:45.251 --> 02:42:45.402
<v Josh Sparkes>OK?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/833-0
02:42:45.762 --> 02:42:50.329
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just aware of there's Mandy's got
three weeks. Yeah, yeah, that's fine.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/833-1
02:42:50.329 --> 02:42:54.595
<v Josh Sparkes>I also did mention to Jill after her
catch up anyway. So she is aware,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/833-2
02:42:54.595 --> 02:42:58.921
<v Josh Sparkes>but she's not mentioned anything.
If if these has been flagged with the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/833-3
02:42:58.921 --> 02:43:00.122
<v Josh Sparkes>Wayne thing. OK, so.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/834-0
02:43:00.482 --> 02:43:04.338
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll speak to Joe tomorrow. Yeah,
I'll make a real note of it,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/834-1
02:43:04.338 --> 02:43:09.050
<v Josh Sparkes>but we can pick up with you separately
and that it's just around start date.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/834-2
02:43:09.050 --> 02:43:13.639
<v Josh Sparkes>So if we were to pick up reporting,
you might need three weeks leave after</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/834-3
02:43:13.639 --> 02:43:16.882
<v Josh Sparkes>when's your start date?
If you don't mind me asking.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/835-0
02:43:17.722 --> 02:43:17.842
<v Josh Sparkes>And.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/836-0
02:43:19.242 --> 02:43:23.820
<v Josh Sparkes>I think now should be on the 26th of
November. November. Yeah, OK. All right.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/836-1
02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:27.166
<v Josh Sparkes>And then these,
these other things in blue that so these</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/836-2
02:43:27.166 --> 02:43:31.568
<v Josh Sparkes>all upcoming things on the project,
that's why I might cut off as well all</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/836-3
02:43:31.568 --> 02:43:36.381
<v Josh Sparkes>things that are coming up on the project,
the blue ones in blue are ones that you</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/836-4
02:43:36.381 --> 02:43:37.202
<v Josh Sparkes>might be most.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/837-0
02:43:37.762 --> 02:43:41.820
<v Josh Sparkes>Interested in but Mali?
Looks like that's that's way beyond your</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/837-1
02:43:41.820 --> 02:43:44.879
<v Josh Sparkes>the holiday days there.
So going into next year,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/837-2
02:43:44.879 --> 02:43:48.687
<v Josh Sparkes>testing that you guys be involved in
training on the system.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/837-3
02:43:48.687 --> 02:43:52.619
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll really get into it then and go
live. That's the plan.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/837-4
02:43:52.619 --> 02:43:54.242
<v Josh Sparkes>So key dates for you guys.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/838-0
02:43:54.522 --> 02:43:57.899
<v Josh Sparkes>The other stuff ahead of that is is more
for us,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/838-1
02:43:57.899 --> 02:44:03.411
<v Josh Sparkes>but just so you can see what's going on,
but I think that's it. No, sorry. Yep,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/838-2
02:44:03.411 --> 02:44:07.477
<v Josh Sparkes>user story stuff.
What's our involvement from there? Yeah,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/838-3
02:44:07.477 --> 02:44:12.162
<v Josh Sparkes>over the next couple of weeks,
we we're doing the dates, aren't we?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/839-0
02:44:13.602 --> 02:44:19.450
<v Josh Sparkes>I understand all the time based on the
based on the workshops,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/839-1
02:44:19.450 --> 02:44:26.782
<v Josh Sparkes>I will start presenting all the user
stories which form part of the functional</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/839-2
02:44:26.782 --> 02:44:32.722
<v Josh Sparkes>requirements. I start,
but I think next week is the first part.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/840-0
02:44:33.202 --> 02:44:35.842
<v Josh Sparkes>Julian,
we're going to then because these</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/840-1
02:44:35.842 --> 02:44:40.808
<v Josh Sparkes>workshops have been mutually exclusive.
You know each part and then there's an</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/840-2
02:44:40.808 --> 02:44:44.768
<v Josh Sparkes>overlay of that whole end to end process
that we talked about.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/840-3
02:44:44.768 --> 02:44:49.608
<v Josh Sparkes>So certainly the first pass of them for
clients we can share that's and then</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/840-4
02:44:49.608 --> 02:44:50.802
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll join them up.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/841-0
02:44:51.162 --> 02:44:54.567
<v Josh Sparkes>To give an overall,
so they'll be sort of probably in phase</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/841-1
02:44:54.567 --> 02:44:58.538
<v Josh Sparkes>as we do, we're doing this,
we're discussing it internally that we'll</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/841-2
02:44:58.538 --> 02:45:03.361
<v Josh Sparkes>do, you'll get those. And then I'm hoping,
so we're probably going to take them one.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/841-3
02:45:03.361 --> 02:45:07.162
<v Josh Sparkes>It'll take me one a day, presumably,
so maybe the week commencing.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/842-0
02:45:07.722 --> 02:45:13.075
<v Josh Sparkes>I just think about the 12th of November
potentially have the first pass for</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/842-1
02:45:13.075 --> 02:45:17.724
<v Josh Sparkes>clients, yes, if not before.
But that's the sort of timeline that</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/842-2
02:45:17.724 --> 02:45:23.429
<v Josh Sparkes>we've got in last week's to write and
then I'll turn around in that in that way.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/842-3
02:45:23.429 --> 02:45:27.162
<v Josh Sparkes>But it could be that if you because of
annual leave.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/843-0
02:45:29.202 --> 02:45:31.593
<v Josh Sparkes>I bring it forward so that you've got a,
you know,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/843-1
02:45:31.593 --> 02:45:34.640
<v Josh Sparkes>I can jiggle it around so that you get
transparency before that.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/843-2
02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:38.344
<v Josh Sparkes>So the other thing to notice there is
there's a lot of requirements across the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/843-3
02:45:38.344 --> 02:45:40.735
<v Josh Sparkes>whole farm.
So what we're trying to do is break it</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/843-4
02:45:40.735 --> 02:45:43.688
<v Josh Sparkes>down into some of these,
which will release certain batches of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/843-5
02:45:43.688 --> 02:45:45.657
<v Josh Sparkes>stories.
So we'll try to make sure that's</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/843-6
02:45:45.657 --> 02:45:46.922
<v Josh Sparkes>contained within a kind of.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/844-0
02:45:47.002 --> 02:45:51.096
<v Josh Sparkes>So particular services can be reviewed as
kind of separate item,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/844-1
02:45:51.096 --> 02:45:54.307
<v Josh Sparkes>but that will start from the second week
November.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/844-2
02:45:54.307 --> 02:45:58.715
<v Josh Sparkes>So you'll start to see some of that.
We'll work with Joe as well. OK,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/844-3
02:45:58.715 --> 02:46:02.682
<v Josh Sparkes>here's about the data of plans to share
those stores with you.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/845-0
02:46:03.602 --> 02:46:06.865
<v Josh Sparkes>We are getting one week to review
approved sign off and I'm ready to</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/845-1
02:46:06.865 --> 02:46:10.790
<v Josh Sparkes>provide back to us because we don't need
to build into our strength cycles, right.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/845-2
02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:13.910
<v Josh Sparkes>So we decide to build it,
demo some of that functionality to use.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/845-3
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:16.747
<v Josh Sparkes>You can look actually that looks exactly
as I wanted or no,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/845-4
02:46:16.747 --> 02:46:18.922
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll make some tweaks here and there as
well.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/846-0
02:46:19.322 --> 02:46:23.016
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we can certainly incorporate
that feedback back into the spring cycle</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/846-1
02:46:23.016 --> 02:46:25.166
<v Josh Sparkes>just initially for that continuously as
well.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/846-2
02:46:25.166 --> 02:46:28.485
<v Josh Sparkes>We plan to kind of have all of the design
done by the end of February.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/846-3
02:46:28.485 --> 02:46:30.542
<v Josh Sparkes>So I don't know how your sessions are
done,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/846-4
02:46:30.542 --> 02:46:34.002
<v Josh Sparkes>but there's might be some additional
product design sessions that we have</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/846-5
02:46:34.002 --> 02:46:34.282
<v Josh Sparkes>where?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/847-0
02:46:34.802 --> 02:46:39.277
<v Josh Sparkes>If you look at it, yes, take some away.
There might be a couple of parking items,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/847-1
02:46:39.277 --> 02:46:43.697
<v Josh Sparkes>so we might have some additional design
sessions which might swan another set of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/847-2
02:46:43.697 --> 02:46:46.862
<v Josh Sparkes>stories as well. So yeah,
that's kind of no, that's good.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/847-3
02:46:46.862 --> 02:46:51.282
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good to understand expectations
around outfits. So yeah, we need to keep.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/848-0
02:46:53.082 --> 02:46:57.634
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, we'll share.
So Joe's got a view of kind of when the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/848-1
02:46:57.634 --> 02:47:02.571
<v Josh Sparkes>Council of these stories across each
functions and ask as well.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/848-2
02:47:02.571 --> 02:47:06.042
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll do it on the session as well,
yeah.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/849-0
02:47:12.922 --> 02:47:16.722
<v Josh Sparkes>The only thing left Ruth is if you wanted
to top the tail of change.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/850-0
02:47:23.682 --> 02:47:26.308
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so the key points I kind of taken away,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/850-1
02:47:26.308 --> 02:47:28.994
<v Josh Sparkes>the key themes were from early this
morning,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/850-2
02:47:28.994 --> 02:47:33.709
<v Josh Sparkes>better ownership on the requester to
provide the relevant details and managing</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/850-3
02:47:33.709 --> 02:47:37.528
<v Josh Sparkes>their stakeholder groups.
That stops you guys being paid in the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/850-4
02:47:37.528 --> 02:47:38.602
<v Josh Sparkes>middle that stops.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/851-0
02:47:39.922 --> 02:47:43.453
<v Josh Sparkes>The C scenes in the e-mail.
I think the auto signing will change.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/851-1
02:47:43.453 --> 02:47:46.395
<v Josh Sparkes>It feels like it will change the culture
in your team,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/851-2
02:47:46.395 --> 02:47:50.085
<v Josh Sparkes>but because we're going to make
everything go to you out on day one,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/851-3
02:47:50.085 --> 02:47:53.509
<v Josh Sparkes>Emily, hopefully you can.
We can phase that in and look at when</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/851-4
02:47:53.509 --> 02:47:57.842
<v Josh Sparkes>it's the appropriate time to bring in the
skills matrix that Deborah was talking</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/851-5
02:47:57.842 --> 02:47:58.162
<v Josh Sparkes>about.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/853-0
02:47:59.322 --> 02:48:02.570
<v Josh Sparkes>For GCC,
my understanding was we're keen to keep</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/853-1
02:48:02.570 --> 02:48:07.674
<v Josh Sparkes>the look and feel so that stakeholders
feel like it feels the same. However,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/853-2
02:48:07.674 --> 02:48:12.778
<v Josh Sparkes>we need to maybe make it a bit more
interactive and more visible to show the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/853-3
02:48:12.778 --> 02:48:15.960
<v Josh Sparkes>status,
and it's easier hopefully for your team</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/853-4
02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:17.882
<v Josh Sparkes>to manage. There seems to be.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/854-0
02:48:20.042 --> 02:48:24.319
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe support is needed or this is an
opportunity to reset behaviours of the</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/854-1
02:48:24.319 --> 02:48:28.263
<v Josh Sparkes>customers or stakeholders around adhering
to Slas and ways of working.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/854-2
02:48:28.263 --> 02:48:30.706
<v Josh Sparkes>Because service now give more
transparency,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/854-3
02:48:30.706 --> 02:48:34.372
<v Josh Sparkes>it may still encourage the behaviour to
go to Mandy and say, hey,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/854-4
02:48:34.372 --> 02:48:37.482
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm going to great,
I'm going to get this in two hours.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/855-0
02:48:38.402 --> 02:48:45.010
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll just need to think of maybe the
softer skill training or how we phase out</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/855-1
02:48:45.010 --> 02:48:51.300
<v Josh Sparkes>some of that behaviour for research.
It seems that the main change seems to be</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/855-2
02:48:51.300 --> 02:48:54.802
<v Josh Sparkes>around getting the detail upfront from
BIT.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/856-0
02:48:55.242 --> 02:48:59.912
<v Josh Sparkes>Completing that and the ServiceNow form
nominations and awards was the lengthy</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/856-1
02:48:59.912 --> 02:49:02.513
<v Josh Sparkes>ones.
I've saved you reporting will pick up</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/856-2
02:49:02.513 --> 02:49:06.592
<v Josh Sparkes>next week, but for ticketing, again,
I think there's an opportunity.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/856-3
02:49:06.592 --> 02:49:10.021
<v Josh Sparkes>And Deborah touched on it,
how do you put all the upfront</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/856-4
02:49:10.021 --> 02:49:13.922
<v Josh Sparkes>information first? So the approvals,
the cost code, the practise.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/857-0
02:49:14.842 --> 02:49:18.957
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's a common theme about how do we
make sure we get the right information</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/857-1
02:49:18.957 --> 02:49:21.548
<v Josh Sparkes>upfront,
right to avoid the to and fro making sure</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/857-2
02:49:21.548 --> 02:49:24.292
<v Josh Sparkes>we have mandatory boxes rather than drop
down fields.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/857-3
02:49:24.292 --> 02:49:27.188
<v Josh Sparkes>If we feel people are just going to keep
clicking other.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/857-4
02:49:27.188 --> 02:49:28.762
<v Josh Sparkes>Did I miss anything other than?</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/858-0
02:49:29.802 --> 02:49:30.162
<v Josh Sparkes>I know you.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/859-0
02:49:32.882 --> 02:49:35.282
<v Josh Sparkes>Anything from you, Mark or others online?
Sorry.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/861-0
02:49:39.092 --> 02:49:43.252
<v Josh Sparkes>Take silence.
We'll put some follow up to a calendar.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/860-0
02:49:40.762 --> 02:49:42.162
<v Mark Sedge>All good, no all good.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/861-1
02:49:43.252 --> 02:49:47.796
<v Josh Sparkes>Save your availability and we'll feed
back into reporting,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/861-2
02:49:47.796 --> 02:49:53.573
<v Josh Sparkes>and then we'll set that session up.
We need a break from us for this week,</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/861-3
02:49:53.573 --> 02:49:55.652
<v Josh Sparkes>but maybe the beginning of.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/862-0
02:49:56.282 --> 02:50:00.630
<v Josh Sparkes>Next week, to pick that up,
but I think you're going to share some of</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/862-1
02:50:00.630 --> 02:50:04.729
<v Josh Sparkes>that checklist. You know,
some of that information anyway that we</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/862-2
02:50:04.729 --> 02:50:07.958
<v Josh Sparkes>discussed.
So this gives us triple points for those</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/862-3
02:50:07.958 --> 02:50:10.442
<v Josh Sparkes>reports, G20 client client and internal.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/863-0
02:50:11.082 --> 02:50:15.642
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, that'd be great. Thank you.
Thanks so much.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/864-0
02:50:17.042 --> 02:50:17.762
<v Mark Sedge>Thank you all.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/867-0
02:50:17.962 --> 02:50:20.562
<v Josh Sparkes>Cheers on the phone. Bye guys.</v>

42bdcdb5-0297-480b-a4a2-b60e72c81bee/868-0
02:50:19.362 --> 02:50:21.042
<v Mark Sedge>All good. Thanks. Bye.</v>
