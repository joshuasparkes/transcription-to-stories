00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:08.081
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>For this JP Morgan one,
you trigger it daily,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1053-1
00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:11.258
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you do it and then you raise those
invoices. I'm not sure.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1053-2
00:00:11.258 --> 00:00:14.974
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm not saying that it falls in the happy
path, but it sort of does,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1053-3
00:00:14.974 --> 00:00:19.282
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it's just based on volumes and the
assignment group will always be yourself</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1053-4
00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:23.590
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that where they tend to land and what has
been worked kind of in the process of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1053-5
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.044
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there is another in Jordan.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1054-0
00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:29.388
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And the team has taken a lot of this work
over, but at the at the moment you,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1054-1
00:00:29.388 --> 00:00:32.121
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it's always generated internally,
but it was,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1054-2
00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:36.386
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it will always be an internal thing.
And but although for actually although I</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1054-3
00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:39.065
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>say that that's not actually true for JP
Morgan,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1054-4
00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:42.235
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so they have a kind of combination of we
do get requests,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1054-5
00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:44.204
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they all fall under the one partner.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1055-0
00:00:44.484 --> 00:00:48.793
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we do get requests and from that PE
and that could be split with a.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1055-1
00:00:48.793 --> 00:00:52.617
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It could be those scenarios that we
talked about typically no,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1055-2
00:00:52.617 --> 00:00:56.320
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>because it will just be billed because
they are filled fees.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1055-3
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.447
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So they're a little bit more
straightforward in terms of the actual</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1055-4
00:01:00.447 --> 00:01:01.844
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing, but it's just.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1056-0
00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:04.876
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>As I say,
they just have a slightly different</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1056-1
00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:09.683
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>process than and the volumes of them and
they're bigger. Yeah. OK, that's good. OK,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1056-2
00:01:09.683 --> 00:01:14.147
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we've got some actions from that and
that'll be opportunity to have a look at</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1056-3
00:01:14.147 --> 00:01:17.524
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that. Thank you.
And then I think we've got query as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1057-0
00:01:19.644 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think this this area is something
critical for skills matrix.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1057-1
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.807
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's heavily keep us independent.
Do you put general queries, Tim?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1057-2
00:01:28.807 --> 00:01:33.844
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think there's a general query as well.
Yeah. Why the second from top?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1058-0
00:01:34.284 --> 00:01:39.106
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, we can put that as query. OK,
now these are probably some of the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1058-1
00:01:39.106 --> 00:01:42.299
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>queries that we talked about in the
beginning,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1058-2
00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.597
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know support I think it's billing
support on three EI think it's a few of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1058-3
00:01:47.597 --> 00:01:52.964
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>those maybe take those are those are the
ones that you get as can you help me?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1059-0
00:01:53.404 --> 00:01:57.199
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>How do I do 3E and then maybe they could
be addressed by a knowledge ask you know</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1059-1
00:01:57.199 --> 00:02:00.532
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so you don't actually get them.
They don't land with you. There's some.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1059-2
00:02:00.532 --> 00:02:02.662
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK.
There's always one that slips through the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1059-3
00:02:02.662 --> 00:02:05.300
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>net that you are.
You're willing to help to transfer the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1059-4
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.726
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>next time that they don't ask you.
But these are the sorts of things that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1059-5
00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:12.429
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we're talking about when we talk about
knowledge that we capture them that they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1059-6
00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:13.124
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>self-serve and.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1061-0
00:02:13.204 --> 00:02:17.008
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And do it themselves.
So anything that we have on those</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1061-1
00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:20.609
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>knowledge articles that you give back to
them today,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1061-2
00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:26.181
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we can start collecting those and that
will be form of that knowledge base. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1061-3
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:27.404
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>yeah, that's good.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1062-0
00:02:27.604 --> 00:02:32.429
<v Mark Sedge>In those in those we we said yesterday
and I think it applies here that if the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1062-1
00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:37.255
<v Mark Sedge>if your audience is starting to type
something in that we can use the keywords</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1062-2
00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:40.492
<v Mark Sedge>and actually present the articles as
they're typing,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1062-3
00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:44.524
<v Mark Sedge>so potentially they will be able to see
what's available to them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1065-0
00:02:44.844 --> 00:02:47.736
<v Mark Sedge>And then click on it,
read it and then they might not do a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1063-0
00:02:46.684 --> 00:02:46.804
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1065-1
00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:50.384
<v Mark Sedge>submission,
and that's what Deborah is saying to save</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1065-2
00:02:50.384 --> 00:02:53.032
<v Mark Sedge>it even coming in.
But we use it almost as as they're</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1066-0
00:02:52.764 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yes, yeah, yeah.
It's a gating process so that you're</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1065-3
00:02:53.032 --> 00:02:57.004
<v Mark Sedge>raising it to guide them as to what's
possible and what they can get themselves.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1066-1
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.676
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>preventing them even hitting you that
you're giving them that, that knowledge.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1066-2
00:03:04.676 --> 00:03:10.767
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, no, that'd be good. Yeah.
Are we actually maybe that practise</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1066-3
00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:11.484
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>finance?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1067-0
00:03:13.044 --> 00:03:17.027
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Report maybe that part. I mean,
that's come in there as a report.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1067-1
00:03:17.027 --> 00:03:19.924
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is that something that they run as a city
bank?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1068-0
00:03:21.164 --> 00:03:25.316
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Maybe that's part of a weekly thing that
they do, or yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1068-1
00:03:25.316 --> 00:03:29.750
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm not sure why that's one under IF,
because it shouldn't be.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1068-2
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.958
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That is a sort of part of like the
process that we do for the Citigroup's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1068-3
00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.084
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>monthly billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1069-0
00:03:36.684 --> 00:03:39.028
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Right.
So that kind of comes in that completes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1069-1
00:03:39.028 --> 00:03:41.521
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing,
it comes in the complex billing as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1069-2
00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:45.461
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But that's just like in a monthly task,
is it the same with like the JP Morgan</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1069-3
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:47.705
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>daily,
but you're doing it monthly for them?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1069-4
00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:50.997
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, it's a similar thing. Yeah. OK,
so that could be scheduled.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1069-5
00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:55.136
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And does it go to the other teams that do
like that workflow that touches other or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1069-6
00:03:55.136 --> 00:03:56.084
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is it sheer volume?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1070-0
00:03:56.364 --> 00:03:59.328
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You're you're raising it,
and then you've raised the bill.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1070-1
00:03:59.328 --> 00:04:03.146
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You do the bill. Essentially. Yes.
It does have to go to sometimes a couple</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1070-2
00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:07.065
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of other people to get the information.
And then it does ultimately go to the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1070-3
00:04:07.065 --> 00:04:09.326
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>client to get that information,
which is it?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1070-4
00:04:09.326 --> 00:04:10.884
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What other teams does it go to?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1071-0
00:04:12.964 --> 00:04:17.712
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's like the SSDG admin team.
I think those guys come under something</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1071-1
00:04:17.712 --> 00:04:21.030
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>like, yeah,
maybe we can get that workflow and see</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1071-2
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.933
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>whether the yeah,
the commonalities of these ones that come</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1071-3
00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:25.844
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>under complex.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1072-0
00:04:27.084 --> 00:04:31.827
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>No, I'm just checking whether it won't be.
It'll be outside of, but outside the mask.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1072-1
00:04:31.827 --> 00:04:35.689
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, that's not an IT team, is it? No.
It'll be like a finance team.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1072-2
00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:39.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's not on ServiceNow.
Legal finance team or something. Whatever.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1072-3
00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:43.687
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, I know. I just kind of know.
I always e-mail like Andrew or Christian</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1072-4
00:04:43.687 --> 00:04:46.004
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>or something like that. So. Sure, exactly.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1073-0
00:04:46.404 --> 00:04:49.228
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>OK, who does what?
But they I don't think they would come</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1073-1
00:04:49.228 --> 00:04:52.587
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>under ServiceNow. OK, anyway, OK,
but you tend to do this outside of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1073-2
00:04:52.587 --> 00:04:55.070
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>service that these aren't queries that
you get in.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1073-3
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.479
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm just thinking about officiating your
time and activity. Yeah, no,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1073-4
00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.228
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that that report is just run as part of
the monthly billing process for that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1073-5
00:05:02.228 --> 00:05:02.764
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>client. OK.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1074-0
00:05:04.644 --> 00:05:09.945
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>These tend to be reports of daily billing
audit, check, simple billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1074-1
00:05:09.945 --> 00:05:13.700
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm not sure if we had many simple
Billings today,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1074-2
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.044
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it was scenario of each,
but there's lots of you know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1075-0
00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:21.905
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It can come under,
but these are the reports that you're</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1075-1
00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:25.673
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>running. Are these reports scheduled?
Are they just like prompts for you?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1075-2
00:05:25.673 --> 00:05:28.625
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They don't say they're scheduled,
but I'm just wondering.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1075-3
00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:32.851
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think the Citibank thing requests for
them or Citibank. One says it's scheduled,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1075-4
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:36.669
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think is it scheduled? But it's not.
I don't think it is on share. Well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1075-5
00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.044
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think it's only that RTB.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1076-0
00:05:38.284 --> 00:05:41.639
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is that what that is? No.
So something different? Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1076-1
00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.234
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that although it's, that's not sure.
It's not done on like,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1076-2
00:05:45.234 --> 00:05:49.488
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>a specific date or anything that you
can't really schedule it as such.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1076-3
00:05:49.488 --> 00:05:52.604
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So these are things that you're running
internally.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1077-0
00:05:54.044 --> 00:05:57.225
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They're not queries.
You don't get asked to do them again.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1077-1
00:05:57.225 --> 00:06:01.647
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It could be something that you that might
be calendar events that we could put in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1077-2
00:06:01.647 --> 00:06:05.098
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as a task, as a reminder.
So that transparency across the whole</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1077-3
00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:08.604
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>team can see it and it's something that
just closed complete so.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1078-0
00:06:09.164 --> 00:06:13.733
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Catches your time spent on it,
and do those reports just is it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1078-1
00:06:13.733 --> 00:06:19.463
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>internally prompt for you to do extra
tasks or is it actually reports that you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1078-2
00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:23.670
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>run and then you need to send somebody
the daily billing,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1078-3
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.644
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>one that actually comes in from a fences?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1079-0
00:06:27.044 --> 00:06:31.894
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>To us each morning, and that's for us.
That's the audit check on the PES that do</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1079-1
00:06:31.894 --> 00:06:36.504
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>their own billing just to check that
they're OK in the house doing all stuff</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1079-2
00:06:36.504 --> 00:06:40.755
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that. Why is that something?
So that check is something that just sits</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1079-3
00:06:40.755 --> 00:06:43.570
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>in your team.
So you just do it and it's done.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1079-4
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.564
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we're just counting time really for
that when.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1080-0
00:06:46.884 --> 00:06:50.517
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Comes in from fences.
You're just logging that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1080-1
00:06:50.517 --> 00:06:55.438
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That work's getting done. Yeah,
a separate monthly one then gets</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1080-2
00:06:55.438 --> 00:07:00.434
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>generated. Yeah, that one.
But those ones fences send us a report</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1080-3
00:07:00.434 --> 00:07:03.084
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and, but we go in and shake it all.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1081-0
00:07:04.484 --> 00:07:08.959
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And see and the check on that isn't.
If you just said marking that the PS are</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1081-1
00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:12.402
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>doing it correctly,
it's not marking their homework and you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1081-2
00:07:12.402 --> 00:07:15.501
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>capture that.
I'm just the metrics moving forward to,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1081-3
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:18.427
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know,
people that might need extra training or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1081-4
00:07:18.427 --> 00:07:23.305
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they're not doing it correctly, you know,
so you have that metrics and feed it back.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1081-5
00:07:23.305 --> 00:07:23.764
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So next.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1082-0
00:07:23.844 --> 00:07:28.078
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Month you're not scooping up the same
names? No. A bit. Well, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1082-1
00:07:28.078 --> 00:07:30.665
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's not something you would like to
track.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1082-2
00:07:30.665 --> 00:07:34.723
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We we need to discuss it and it will come
back to Glasgow. Actually,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1082-3
00:07:34.723 --> 00:07:39.604
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>at some stage it's it's just good to have
kind of an access for the BES right now.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1083-0
00:07:40.924 --> 00:07:45.235
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So when you get that report from Princess,
you go through everything that the peas</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1083-1
00:07:45.235 --> 00:07:49.546
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>have done and you all we've captured that
amount wrong or something or whatever it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1083-2
00:07:49.546 --> 00:07:53.078
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>could be. What do you do with that?
Basically, we're just checking.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1083-3
00:07:53.078 --> 00:07:54.844
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's mainly to make sure that the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1084-0
00:07:55.124 --> 00:08:00.659
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The cake that's been applied to the
report or commend with the you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1084-1
00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:05.284
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the P whose action that then voice number
matter client the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1085-0
00:08:05.524 --> 00:08:05.604
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1087-0
00:08:06.924 --> 00:08:11.786
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Location for tax to from so on the how
like is that UK bill is it went to UK</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1087-1
00:08:11.786 --> 00:08:16.459
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>client or is that went to you know
outside of we applied that the default</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1087-2
00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:21.385
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>peer is that because that always has to
be the same as a client and it's just</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1087-3
00:08:21.385 --> 00:08:25.932
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's where all the sort of errors can
happen and if the E in the system</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1087-4
00:08:25.932 --> 00:08:26.564
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>sometimes.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1088-0
00:08:26.804 --> 00:08:30.925
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we just want to make sure that they've
not missed no spoken, I'm not spoken.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1088-1
00:08:30.925 --> 00:08:33.243
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So if everyone's fine,
that's a general app,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1088-2
00:08:33.243 --> 00:08:36.386
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we wouldn't know what the amount to get
billed was supposed.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1088-3
00:08:36.386 --> 00:08:39.529
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm wondering if that's a good one.
They just tax in client.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1088-4
00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:42.980
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If there's an error, right.
So say you go or that that hasn't been</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1088-5
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.484
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>applied properly. Who do you go back to?
Well, we would go back to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1089-0
00:08:46.564 --> 00:08:49.666
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>To the PE. Right. OK.
I would think that the request because we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1089-1
00:08:49.666 --> 00:08:52.623
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>don't have the request. Sorry.
Let me just get back to them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1089-2
00:08:52.623 --> 00:08:56.355
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And so it's it's more about from a three
E system perspective that they have</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1089-3
00:08:56.355 --> 00:08:58.925
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>selected, yeah,
there are three absolutely get that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1089-4
00:08:58.925 --> 00:09:01.882
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>What I'm trying to understand is do we
need a workflow here?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1089-5
00:09:01.882 --> 00:09:03.724
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Because if you're going to be sending.</v>

00:09:05.284 --> 00:09:09.209
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Back if you like, probably a grant.
But you're you're saying that these are</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1090-1
00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:12.825
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the errors, it can be open.
It doesn't need to be a lengthy, but who?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1090-2
00:09:12.825 --> 00:09:15.821
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It was responsible?
The reason why there was an error and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1090-3
00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:18.765
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>closed complete,
whether they get notified at that point</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1090-4
00:09:18.765 --> 00:09:21.348
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we could park because it might be a
conversation.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1090-5
00:09:21.348 --> 00:09:23.724
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But at the end of the month it could be
this.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1091-0
00:09:23.804 --> 00:09:28.278
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>To be incorporated into training,
they might not want to get a notification</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1091-1
00:09:28.278 --> 00:09:31.281
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that say they don't,
but it could be a collection.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1091-2
00:09:31.281 --> 00:09:34.755
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>A good net that then stops these things
that are, I think,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1091-3
00:09:34.755 --> 00:09:39.406
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>more things about is making sure that the
information is updated. And so yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1091-4
00:09:39.406 --> 00:09:41.644
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>right. So that's your response to see.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1092-0
00:09:43.164 --> 00:09:47.138
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That fact has been captured wrong. Yeah,
you wouldn't just update the fact you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1092-1
00:09:47.138 --> 00:09:50.458
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>would just go back to them and see that
you update the VAT. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1092-2
00:09:50.458 --> 00:09:53.778
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we would go back. I mean,
I can't find when was last year we sort</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1092-3
00:09:53.778 --> 00:09:57.350
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of had an example we would back and query
it and then, you know, look,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1092-4
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.016
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>worst case scenario,
if they hadn't come back to us,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1092-5
00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:02.884
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we would just begin in reverse and then
voice ourselves.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1093-0
00:10:03.044 --> 00:10:05.711
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Because if you know that's wrong,
it's you're right.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1093-1
00:10:05.711 --> 00:10:08.882
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There is some actions on the back of it.
Yeah, there's a task.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1093-2
00:10:08.882 --> 00:10:12.808
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There's a task to be done because you're
not just checking it and going well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1093-3
00:10:12.808 --> 00:10:16.633
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There was mistakes there. Oh, well, yeah.
You know. No, no, it needs to be.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1093-4
00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:20.459
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The changes need to be made in three.
But what I'm trying to understand is,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1093-5
00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:22.724
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>is that your responsibility made the
change.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1094-0
00:10:22.804 --> 00:10:26.757
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Changes or does it go back to the PE?
So if it goes back to the PE then that's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1094-1
00:10:26.757 --> 00:10:29.910
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we can catch up. Yeah. Yeah.
It should always go back and they</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1094-2
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.162
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>evaluate it. Yeah. Yeah,
we'd expect him to.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1094-3
00:10:32.162 --> 00:10:34.164
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But I think we're a little bit so again.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1095-0
00:10:36.844 --> 00:10:40.308
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>No, they wouldn't know. No,
but they'll get a notification. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1095-1
00:10:40.308 --> 00:10:44.454
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they can get the notification. Yeah.
Then it's not a point that we're unclear.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1095-2
00:10:44.454 --> 00:10:47.866
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think we're hesitant because we want to
bring this back to us.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1095-3
00:10:47.866 --> 00:10:51.067
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So maybe four months,
five months down the line might not be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1095-4
00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:54.164
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>required because I'm.
I'm just trying to check a couple of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1095-5
00:10:54.164 --> 00:10:55.004
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>things, but one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1096-0
00:10:55.564 --> 00:10:58.705
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>This is a report that's automatically run
every day,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1096-1
00:10:58.705 --> 00:11:03.447
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and you might have multiple different
issues in there which might mean that you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1096-2
00:11:03.447 --> 00:11:06.351
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>might have to go out to multiple
different P ES,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1096-3
00:11:06.351 --> 00:11:10.678
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>which would be a lot of kind of creating
the cases creating the request,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1096-4
00:11:10.678 --> 00:11:15.124
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>creating the tasks to then there's not
too many P ES doing billing anyway.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1097-0
00:11:16.124 --> 00:11:20.337
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We've got one department who do one. Yeah,
they need other PES,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1097-1
00:11:20.337 --> 00:11:24.879
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but even then they don't.
They don't have to action their own bills.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1097-2
00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:28.369
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I mean you,
you might have some days will win and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1097-3
00:11:28.369 --> 00:11:33.438
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>there won't be any in any way to check.
And I think this is probably how why</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1097-4
00:11:33.438 --> 00:11:35.084
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>billing in the UK exists.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1098-0
00:11:35.164 --> 00:11:38.361
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Because in Australia that obviously
they're all doing it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1098-1
00:11:38.361 --> 00:11:42.495
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but you're just scooping up the ones
where they are doing it on their own,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1098-2
00:11:42.495 --> 00:11:47.015
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you're doing all the others that you're
just iterative. Yeah. Verification check.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1098-3
00:11:47.015 --> 00:11:50.764
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You're that sort of reconciliation part
of that process, attention.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1099-0
00:11:51.004 --> 00:11:54.111
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Because what I was trying to think was,
could we have a request that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1099-1
00:11:54.111 --> 00:11:57.624
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>automatically creates a few every day
that you can then assign to one of your</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1099-2
00:11:57.624 --> 00:11:59.965
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>team or automatically have it assigned to
the team,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1099-3
00:11:59.965 --> 00:12:03.208
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>which is really kind of part of that kind
of daily check on the report.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1099-4
00:12:03.208 --> 00:12:05.685
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's just that if you have multiple
issues, let's say,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1099-5
00:12:05.685 --> 00:12:08.657
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I know it's not as many,
but let's say you've got multiple issues</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1099-6
00:12:08.657 --> 00:12:10.684
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>with different PES across different
matters.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1100-0
00:12:11.884 --> 00:12:15.522
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Then trying to close off for that
particular request every day might be</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1100-1
00:12:15.522 --> 00:12:18.959
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>dependent on multiple PES.
I'm just trying to figure out how we can</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1100-2
00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:22.193
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's not that big. Yeah.
What do they do in? Because Australia,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1100-3
00:12:22.193 --> 00:12:25.680
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean, there's only everyone's.
All the PS are doing their billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1100-4
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.167
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So do they check how do they do their
daily check that that happens.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1100-5
00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:30.684
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They don't know that how they.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1101-0
00:12:30.764 --> 00:12:34.183
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>They do their daily cheques,
but they have to get that they have their</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1101-1
00:12:34.183 --> 00:12:36.639
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>own. I mean,
they would have their access on three</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1101-2
00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:38.902
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>East,
so it's easier for them whereas we are I</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1101-3
00:12:38.902 --> 00:12:42.369
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>think that limitations of the access
would be there for the PS as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1101-4
00:12:42.369 --> 00:12:45.066
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we are dependent, all right,
it's it's not that big,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1101-5
00:12:45.066 --> 00:12:48.197
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we could officially as you said
there's not that many years,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1101-6
00:12:48.197 --> 00:12:50.364
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but we could certainly put a workflow in
or.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1102-0
00:12:50.444 --> 00:12:54.850
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And that's I think it goes,
it goes a step before because we get this</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1102-1
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.312
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>from fences.
So when fences are sending automatically,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1102-2
00:12:58.312 --> 00:13:01.837
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that case is initiated, you know,
and fences are in IT.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1102-3
00:13:01.837 --> 00:13:06.684
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So we'll be what you get a task from them.
We do. Yeah. OK. OK, that's good.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1103-0
00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:13.759
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Simple billing report, scheduled billing.
We've done those report schedules that we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1103-1
00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:16.867
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>can.
There's calendar events that you normally</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1103-2
00:13:16.867 --> 00:13:18.124
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>do to capture that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1104-0
00:13:20.804 --> 00:13:24.237
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Sundry invoice. We did that one.
That's why I put it under the general.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1104-1
00:13:24.237 --> 00:13:26.764
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's probably why I kept this was the
query, yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1105-0
00:13:28.644 --> 00:13:33.058
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But the last one do we need to discuss
the secondment schedule one further or do</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1105-1
00:13:33.058 --> 00:13:37.308
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we want to put that as a parking lot and
put that as a parking lot because of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1105-2
00:13:37.308 --> 00:13:40.524
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>different teams?
You know there's multiple teams involved.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1106-0
00:13:44.284 --> 00:13:48.090
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Oh, managed time.
I knew that something in the tab at the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1106-1
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.093
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>top of my head managed time cards,
of which there are a few,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1106-2
00:13:52.093 --> 00:13:55.178
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so I suppose back on the back of the
invoices.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1106-3
00:13:55.178 --> 00:13:59.444
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Is this something you raise or this comes
in as a general query?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1107-0
00:14:00.084 --> 00:14:02.696
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Or it might be these are rates and
matters.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1107-1
00:14:02.696 --> 00:14:06.079
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I just wanted to check the check in time
card narrative.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1107-2
00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:10.888
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Maybe that's something they've written
upon it transferring time or purging time</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1107-3
00:14:10.888 --> 00:14:13.737
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>a bit.
That probably write offs we talked about</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1107-4
00:14:13.737 --> 00:14:18.724
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and that the transfer we did the top one
checking time now is that I'll check with.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1108-0
00:14:19.644 --> 00:14:20.564
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yes, I don't.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1109-0
00:14:22.484 --> 00:14:25.508
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't. I don't.
I wasn't aware I was part of the process.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1109-1
00:14:25.508 --> 00:14:29.592
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So I think that might have been something
that was the at the beginning and it's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1109-2
00:14:29.592 --> 00:14:32.314
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>still just been left.
We talked about time yesterday,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1109-3
00:14:32.314 --> 00:14:35.540
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>a lot with rates of matter is everything
with investment funds.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1109-4
00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.204
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>As far as I'm aware just because.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1110-0
00:14:37.524 --> 00:14:40.161
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Under the one box. Yeah. OK,
so I could take.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1110-1
00:14:40.161 --> 00:14:44.690
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Maybe you could serve with Chris and I'll
check also under the rates of matter</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1110-2
00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.557
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>narrative,
whether that's captured as part of the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1110-3
00:14:47.557 --> 00:14:52.029
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>quick, you know, because the queries,
whether it routes to rates of matter or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1110-4
00:14:52.029 --> 00:14:53.004
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that's something.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1111-0
00:14:53.564 --> 00:14:57.116
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>As a particular case,
or whether there's some, yeah, I. Well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1111-1
00:14:57.116 --> 00:15:01.127
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I wouldn't have. Yeah, I'll double check.
But I wasn't aware of that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1111-2
00:15:01.127 --> 00:15:04.336
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We extensively covered queries on time
cards yesterday,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1111-3
00:15:04.336 --> 00:15:07.831
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so maybe that's something that might be a
special exception,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1111-4
00:15:07.831 --> 00:15:12.244
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>or if you could check that would be very
helpful. Yeah, I'll check that one.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1112-0
00:15:14.084 --> 00:15:17.275
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's some billing done.
I mean extensively.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1112-1
00:15:17.275 --> 00:15:20.328
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So thank you for today.
Obviously it's not.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1112-2
00:15:20.328 --> 00:15:25.879
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's bringing that up to that happy path
queries and then managing that service</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1112-3
00:15:25.879 --> 00:15:28.724
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>for the building. So I really appreciate.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1113-0
00:15:29.284 --> 00:15:32.950
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know all the inputs there,
there's lots of activity that's part of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1113-1
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.429
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that.
And then we go away and the user story so</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1113-2
00:15:35.429 --> 00:15:38.270
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you contributed to all that, you know,
ads in billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1113-3
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.420
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I want to do the following complex
billing because you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1113-4
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.828
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we'll write all of that,
bring that together to you to view which</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1113-5
00:15:44.828 --> 00:15:48.444
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>will be formed as part of the functional
spec that we did save today.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1114-0
00:15:48.804 --> 00:15:51.620
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But certainly having this sort of simply
so,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1114-1
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.562
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>each thing is in a mutually exclusive
process.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1114-2
00:15:54.562 --> 00:15:59.445
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It manages up to managing voice service
and we've seen managing voice service</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1114-3
00:15:59.445 --> 00:16:04.640
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>across many of the work streams this week.
So it's our task to go away and come up</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1114-4
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.204
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>with the.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1115-0
00:16:05.844 --> 00:16:09.547
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Consolidated managing invoice,
I mean you touched on E billing,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1115-1
00:16:09.547 --> 00:16:14.060
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know and AP as well there's there's
some crossover and we certainly don't</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1115-2
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.748
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>want different swim lanes where there is
a handshake between them and that would</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1115-3
00:16:18.748 --> 00:16:20.484
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>all be you know a streamlined.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1116-0
00:16:20.964 --> 00:16:25.692
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>She says with Utopia hat on,
it's a workflow easier said than done,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1116-1
00:16:25.692 --> 00:16:30.768
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but this is this is not, as you said,
three. The master of all the work.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1116-2
00:16:30.768 --> 00:16:36.400
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>This is managing your task in the most
efficient way so that you're not managing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1116-3
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.364
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>tasks more than you are in,
you know in the actual work.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1117-0
00:16:40.564 --> 00:16:43.534
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But no,
I really appreciate to say thank you. No,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1117-1
00:16:43.534 --> 00:16:46.682
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>thank you.
Do you have any other questions or I mean</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1117-2
00:16:46.682 --> 00:16:50.008
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it doesn't stop here,
this is the beginning as it were.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1117-3
00:16:50.008 --> 00:16:54.166
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>One of the ones I want to mention earlier,
which would be quite good.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1117-4
00:16:54.166 --> 00:16:58.562
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't know if it worked with with the
request coming in for an invoice.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1117-5
00:16:58.562 --> 00:17:00.404
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Now I've mentioned like urgent.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1118-0
00:17:00.484 --> 00:17:03.544
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And a budget was faulty to the top,
the subject heading.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1118-1
00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:06.927
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But if there was again,
we don't want to complicate the forum,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1118-2
00:17:06.927 --> 00:17:10.954
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but if there was a section see.
But if it was like how much we're billing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1118-3
00:17:10.954 --> 00:17:13.424
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And yeah,
the actual amount that amount would</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1118-4
00:17:13.424 --> 00:17:17.559
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>actually that's what I'm saying the
subject you know to get that as you said</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1118-5
00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:20.244
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think you gave the example that it's a
million.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1119-0
00:17:20.364 --> 00:17:23.538
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But they only want to build the value.
You would capture that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1119-1
00:17:23.538 --> 00:17:27.618
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's a key that's a key data in which,
because that would that would be really</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1119-2
00:17:27.618 --> 00:17:31.246
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>hilt. And that separates God.
It's not for a million, it's only for 20,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1119-3
00:17:31.246 --> 00:17:34.268
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>000 and not only,
but those are the type of metrics that we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1119-4
00:17:34.268 --> 00:17:36.284
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>want them to complete. So that you know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1120-0
00:17:37.204 --> 00:17:40.420
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The actual amount,
so I assume they may know the kind of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1120-1
00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.484
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>process or to planned process date for
that particular bill or invoice.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1120-2
00:17:44.484 --> 00:17:48.942
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Would they have that kind of indication
of it needs to be billed by the end of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1120-3
00:17:48.942 --> 00:17:51.764
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>this month or by next month or in two
weeks time?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1121-0
00:17:52.244 --> 00:17:56.105
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>If they were requesting invite voice it,
you know, we would have it done. You know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1121-1
00:17:56.105 --> 00:17:58.403
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we'll finish about 24 hours. OK.
Let me be. Yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1121-2
00:17:58.403 --> 00:18:01.667
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we wouldn't really want them to.
Just wondering if we could do that an</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1121-3
00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:05.252
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>amount and also a date that we want to
target to so we can then start to help</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1121-4
00:18:05.252 --> 00:18:07.872
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>with the priority. Yeah,
we capture like effective date.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1121-5
00:18:07.872 --> 00:18:10.355
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know that things were yesterday,
today next week.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1121-6
00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:11.964
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know that will be part of that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1122-0
00:18:12.004 --> 00:18:16.152
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Prioritisation. Nature.
I mean generally we ever been able to do</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1122-1
00:18:16.152 --> 00:18:19.725
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>more scheduled billing. Yeah,
you know that would work,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1122-2
00:18:19.725 --> 00:18:24.703
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but at the moment everything just comes
in as you personally definitely yeah.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1122-3
00:18:24.703 --> 00:18:29.936
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>When scheduled billing would be you get
to be first week you get to be the second</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1122-4
00:18:29.936 --> 00:18:31.404
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know that would be.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1123-0
00:18:31.564 --> 00:18:34.543
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That deal,
rather than everything on the 4th week or</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1123-1
00:18:34.543 --> 00:18:35.724
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the end of the month.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1124-0
00:18:37.284 --> 00:18:41.055
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Would that be a good change that you know?
Yeah, but I'm not sure there. When you go,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1124-1
00:18:41.055 --> 00:18:43.292
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Julie. No.
I was gonna say just very quickly we'll</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1124-2
00:18:43.292 --> 00:18:45.397
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>cover this as well.
We can share this with you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1124-3
00:18:45.397 --> 00:18:48.949
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But as you start to work through those
different cases and now that you're using</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1124-4
00:18:48.949 --> 00:18:51.186
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ServiceNow,
it will give you a lot more insight in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1124-5
00:18:51.186 --> 00:18:54.738
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>terms of that kind of transparency in
terms of workloads, the cases, the states,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1124-6
00:18:54.738 --> 00:18:56.844
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what do you need to react to?
What do you need?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1126-0
00:18:56.884 --> 00:19:00.396
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's kind of so actually that's less less
higher priority that you need to work on.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1126-1
00:19:00.396 --> 00:19:02.654
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>This is an example of kind of reports and
dashboards.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1126-2
00:19:02.654 --> 00:19:06.083
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You'll have your own kind of workspace
that you can work through different cases.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1126-3
00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:08.131
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know,
team leads can then start to allocate,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1126-4
00:19:08.131 --> 00:19:10.933
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>etcetera if they need to.
We're hoping that we can use some of the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1126-5
00:19:10.933 --> 00:19:13.275
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>auto assignment,
but that's something to to work for as</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1126-6
00:19:13.275 --> 00:19:13.484
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1127-0
00:19:14.284 --> 00:19:17.532
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah, I was going to say not just yours.
You get transparency.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1127-1
00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:20.059
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Each of you could have transparency in
the team,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1127-2
00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:24.081
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so you don't have to just see my and
think I'm a busy is no one else but you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1127-3
00:19:24.081 --> 00:19:26.763
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You get to see that whole transparency of
the team.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1127-4
00:19:26.763 --> 00:19:29.084
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It's not segregated that you only see
yours.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1128-0
00:19:29.404 --> 00:19:33.240
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You'll have full transparency as a team,
and presuming that that's how you want it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1128-1
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.985
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you don't want the segregation that you
get. You want everyone to say everything.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1128-2
00:19:36.985 --> 00:19:39.178
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah,
I think ideally including complex billing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1128-3
00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:42.877
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>or is that do you tend to you don't mind
the rest of the team saying it or yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1128-4
00:19:42.877 --> 00:19:44.887
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>no,
I would say it's fine because again and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1128-5
00:19:44.887 --> 00:19:48.267
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>again as well as that instance like
showing if I wasn't here or something</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1128-6
00:19:48.267 --> 00:19:48.724
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>like that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1129-0
00:19:49.364 --> 00:19:52.512
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And at least there's awareness that and
it's good. I mean,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1129-1
00:19:52.512 --> 00:19:55.288
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we usually you usually know when you're
on complex,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1129-2
00:19:55.288 --> 00:19:59.024
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but it just it gives everyday that
awareness as well on it like yeah,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1129-3
00:19:59.024 --> 00:20:03.187
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think the biggest benefit from what
we've got and share with all the now is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1129-4
00:20:03.187 --> 00:20:07.563
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we've got a standard dashboard and you're
filtering really AC different groups of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1129-5
00:20:07.563 --> 00:20:08.364
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>things whereas.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1130-0
00:20:09.404 --> 00:20:12.395
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Give you dashboards for each thing so you
can flip between them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1130-1
00:20:12.395 --> 00:20:15.524
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So if you imagine like tabs,
I suppose you could move through tabs,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1130-2
00:20:15.524 --> 00:20:17.871
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>etcetera,
so that you're looking at different cues</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1130-3
00:20:17.871 --> 00:20:21.230
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and things. It's. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
It's probably that mindset. Like,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1130-4
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.623
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know, I don't know,
you sort of start your day.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1130-5
00:20:23.623 --> 00:20:25.924
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Now you go into your calendar in your
e-mail box.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1131-0
00:20:26.724 --> 00:20:30.066
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You sigh and think, oh, I'm not busy.
I might say this is presented to this</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1131-1
00:20:30.066 --> 00:20:33.672
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>replaces that you know what you're doing.
You know how your day's panning out and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1131-2
00:20:33.672 --> 00:20:36.443
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's laid out in front of you as well as
the rest of the team.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1131-3
00:20:36.443 --> 00:20:39.785
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think one of one of the things ticket
ran kind of reports and dashboards.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1131-4
00:20:39.785 --> 00:20:42.204
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We will build a set of base set for you
to review. So.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1132-0
00:20:42.924 --> 00:20:45.816
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I always find that actually,
as you start to use it as you get used to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1132-1
00:20:45.816 --> 00:20:48.708
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it, then you start to think, oh,
actually I'd love to see this tougher</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1132-2
00:20:48.708 --> 00:20:50.703
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>report or I'd love to see this on the
dashboard.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1132-3
00:20:50.703 --> 00:20:53.677
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So these are quite easy to build,
but it's best when you start to use it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1132-4
00:20:53.677 --> 00:20:56.569
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and start to get used to it.
So start with the base and the foundation</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1132-5
00:20:56.569 --> 00:20:59.461
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of what we will provide for now.
And if you have certain requirements,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1132-6
00:20:59.461 --> 00:21:00.724
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we can start to build those in.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1133-0
00:21:01.164 --> 00:21:05.086
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>But as you get used to it,
then you can start to to build additional</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1133-1
00:21:05.086 --> 00:21:08.837
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ones on top. Yeah. Yeah.
And I I always think of reports at word,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1133-2
00:21:08.837 --> 00:21:11.509
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>but I always think of them as their
questions.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1133-3
00:21:11.509 --> 00:21:16.056
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And you can sort of say I would like to
know how many invoices you know you can</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1133-4
00:21:16.056 --> 00:21:16.284
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>use.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1134-0
00:21:16.604 --> 00:21:19.020
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Without exporting a report,
you can use your table.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1134-1
00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.228
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's a table view with lists.
I would like to know how many and it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1134-2
00:21:22.228 --> 00:21:24.551
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>answers the question you know rather than
report.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1134-3
00:21:24.551 --> 00:21:27.666
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'd like to think of them if it can
answer my question of the day.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1134-4
00:21:27.666 --> 00:21:30.966
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't need to go somewhere,
so I'd like to think about ServiceNow is</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1134-5
00:21:30.966 --> 00:21:34.266
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>doing that rather than reports.
It's answering those insights that you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1134-6
00:21:34.266 --> 00:21:36.404
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>didn't know that you had or you want to
know.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1135-0
00:21:36.524 --> 00:21:39.380
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Immediately. Yeah,
and it can do that through the feet,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1135-1
00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.359
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the filtering and the look up features.
The other piece that we've touched on</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1135-2
00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:47.389
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>this a few Times Now is particularly
around cloud knowledge management and how</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1135-3
00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:50.603
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>do we start to drive the users and
employees and PES etcetera.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1135-4
00:21:50.603 --> 00:21:52.644
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So the space where actually you can get.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1136-0
00:21:52.964 --> 00:21:56.422
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The certain knowledge I need on FAQ very
quickly rather than engaging with the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1136-1
00:21:56.422 --> 00:21:59.749
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>team constantly where they need to get
and they get that support that makes</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1136-2
00:21:59.749 --> 00:22:01.719
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>sense,
but it's almost like helping to drive</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1136-3
00:22:01.719 --> 00:22:05.133
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that kind of self-service capability.
It's one of the things that we'll start</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1136-4
00:22:05.133 --> 00:22:07.804
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to walk through as well. Yeah. Yeah. No,
no, it sounds good.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1137-0
00:22:10.724 --> 00:22:13.482
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Just very quickly in terms of what we'll
do, so all of it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1137-1
00:22:13.482 --> 00:22:16.849
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you know this has been great discussions
kind of understand some of the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1137-2
00:22:16.849 --> 00:22:20.356
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>intricacies of the process and the
dependencies on some of the other teams</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1137-3
00:22:20.356 --> 00:22:22.648
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as well.
We are going to start to build those as</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1137-4
00:22:22.648 --> 00:22:25.219
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>user stories.
So you know what is it that we want as a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1137-5
00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:27.324
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>requirement from a user centric
perspective.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1138-0
00:22:27.964 --> 00:22:30.039
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That's what we'll then take into our
Sprint backlog.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1138-1
00:22:30.039 --> 00:22:32.701
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We'll start to plan those out.
We'll also think about some of those</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1138-2
00:22:32.701 --> 00:22:35.716
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>cross department dependencies as well.
So you know we talked about all those</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1138-3
00:22:35.716 --> 00:22:38.457
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>different functions and there's handoff
points and certain, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1138-4
00:22:38.457 --> 00:22:40.610
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>build capabilities that we're going to be
standing up.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1138-5
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.664
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>How do those all connect together as well?
So those are the things that we'll</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1138-6
00:22:43.664 --> 00:22:44.604
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>capture in here as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1139-0
00:22:46.524 --> 00:22:49.813
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'm going to skip over this for the
moment.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1139-1
00:22:49.813 --> 00:22:54.748
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I'll just let joy just talk through some
of those change impacts.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1139-2
00:22:54.748 --> 00:22:58.337
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So today's conversation has been really
useful,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1139-3
00:22:58.337 --> 00:23:04.244
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>really helpful to understand the billing
processes and how you currently work.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1140-0
00:23:04.764 --> 00:23:08.308
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I should.
I've captured a couple of different</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1140-1
00:23:08.308 --> 00:23:12.007
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>impacts.
One kind of overarching one around the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1140-2
00:23:12.007 --> 00:23:17.864
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>move to service now and how you'll be
managing billing requests on that new</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1140-3
00:23:17.864 --> 00:23:21.871
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>platform.
Also the cultural shift for P ES partners</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1140-4
00:23:21.871 --> 00:23:23.644
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to shift their mindset.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1141-0
00:23:24.444 --> 00:23:30.074
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>From using emails for the requests and
written notes as well to using a formal</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1141-1
00:23:30.074 --> 00:23:34.066
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>request form.
So that's going to be a huge like mindset</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1141-2
00:23:34.066 --> 00:23:38.129
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>change. Obviously.
I completely appreciate partners have</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1141-3
00:23:38.129 --> 00:23:41.764
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>always worked that way.
It's been easier for them.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1142-0
00:23:42.764 --> 00:23:47.865
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So yeah, to help mitigate that change,
we would definitely recommend doing a</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1142-1
00:23:47.865 --> 00:23:51.509
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>phased approach,
so we'll work with certain groups and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1142-2
00:23:51.509 --> 00:23:54.689
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>make them the early adopters. For example,
PES.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1142-3
00:23:54.689 --> 00:23:57.869
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Hopefully they'll be a lot easier to work
with,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1142-4
00:23:57.869 --> 00:24:01.844
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so we can just make sure that they
understand the benefits.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1143-0
00:24:02.004 --> 00:24:05.367
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>We make the form as easy as possible for
them to fill in,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1143-1
00:24:05.367 --> 00:24:09.716
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and then they can start to see the
benefit of of doing things in that way,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1143-2
00:24:09.716 --> 00:24:14.529
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and then that should hopefully help them
build the the desire to use that platform</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1143-3
00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:19.110
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>and they can see the results as well.
So hopefully that will support them with</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1143-4
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:20.444
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>their adoption journey.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1144-0
00:24:21.604 --> 00:24:25.924
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I've also captured some changes around
the OP model change,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1144-1
00:24:25.924 --> 00:24:31.180
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so the P ES in the UK having less billing
responsibilities in Australia,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1144-2
00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:37.084
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>so the need for training to help enhance
their skills and knowledge in that area.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1145-0
00:24:38.204 --> 00:24:43.632
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And we mentioned about mandating bill
guides to streamline the Bill amendment</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1145-1
00:24:43.632 --> 00:24:48.643
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>process. What else have I got here?
Partners as well taking their bill,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1145-2
00:24:48.643 --> 00:24:54.072
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>checking responsibility seriously again
to help streamline the Bill amendment</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1145-3
00:24:54.072 --> 00:24:57.204
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>process,
reducing the workload on your team.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1146-0
00:24:58.804 --> 00:25:02.705
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>And then finally,
I've got something around moving complex</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1146-1
00:25:02.705 --> 00:25:07.996
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>queries to ServiceNow to help manage the
communication process and in turn that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1146-2
00:25:07.996 --> 00:25:13.286
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>should help the team as well. Sandeep,
I know you're quite keen on tracking the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1146-3
00:25:13.286 --> 00:25:16.924
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>team capacity,
so if that can also move to ServiceNow.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1147-0
00:25:17.084 --> 00:25:20.533
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That would help,
but that's kind of the impact that I've</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1147-1
00:25:20.533 --> 00:25:25.375
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>captured just opening it up to see if
there's anything else you think I need to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1147-2
00:25:25.375 --> 00:25:28.644
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>capture here as one of the key impacts
for your team.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1148-0
00:25:31.684 --> 00:25:36.083
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I don't know that kind of course,
and I think we'll roll them up with the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1148-1
00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:40.304
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>as a services as we go through each of
the services, we'll roll those.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1148-2
00:25:40.304 --> 00:25:43.455
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>The impact you know,
we'll roll them all up to their</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1148-3
00:25:43.455 --> 00:25:46.844
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>associated service so that you'll see all
those impacts.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1149-0
00:25:47.204 --> 00:25:51.889
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Yeah. And you don't have to.
Don't have to think of everything right</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1149-1
00:25:51.889 --> 00:25:54.945
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>now.
What I would do after this workshop and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1149-2
00:25:54.945 --> 00:26:00.649
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>after every workshop I've been writing up
a report called a Change Impact report on</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1149-3
00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:05.809
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>how like the current ways of working and
how ServiceNow will impact various</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1149-4
00:26:05.809 --> 00:26:06.964
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>different themes.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1150-0
00:26:07.604 --> 00:26:10.858
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So what I will do,
I will send that report to you once it's</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1150-1
00:26:10.858 --> 00:26:13.354
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>ready.
So after all the finance workshops are</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1150-2
00:26:13.354 --> 00:26:17.368
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>done next week on Tuesday I'll do that,
write up and then I'll share that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1150-3
00:26:17.368 --> 00:26:20.839
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>document with you for review.
And obviously when you review it,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1150-4
00:26:20.839 --> 00:26:24.853
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>you can if you think of any other
processes or any other impacts you want</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1150-5
00:26:24.853 --> 00:26:26.644
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>to add or if maybe I've captured.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1151-0
00:26:26.724 --> 00:26:30.877
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Something and it's not quite accurate or
this specific ways of working that you</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1151-1
00:26:30.877 --> 00:26:34.199
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>want to call out as well.
Then you can we can do that and I can</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1151-2
00:26:34.199 --> 00:26:36.484
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>make sure that that captured in the
report.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1152-0
00:26:39.684 --> 00:26:42.168
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Great. Thank you. Did you want to? No,
just very quick,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1152-1
00:26:42.168 --> 00:26:45.230
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's a couple of dates for you.
So you can see also so from a design</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1152-2
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.449
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>perspective,
you know we've done these kind of in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1152-3
00:26:47.449 --> 00:26:50.732
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>person workshops. You as you can see,
there's already a number of kind of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1152-4
00:26:50.732 --> 00:26:53.794
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>outstanding design sessions.
We need to go through as well some that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1152-5
00:26:53.794 --> 00:26:55.924
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we have caption we can take that way and
build.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1153-0
00:26:56.364 --> 00:26:59.205
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So for our plan,
February 27th is kind of where we have to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1153-1
00:26:59.205 --> 00:27:03.153
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>get the design complete that allow us to
kind of have that opportunity to kind of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1153-2
00:27:03.153 --> 00:27:06.717
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>build out all of those different
requirements and also thinking about the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1153-3
00:27:06.717 --> 00:27:10.714
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>end to end services that we need to build
as well by the beginning of June is when</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1153-4
00:27:10.714 --> 00:27:11.244
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we'll have.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1154-0
00:27:11.604 --> 00:27:14.501
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Really can't the effects even most of
that Bill is complete.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1154-1
00:27:14.501 --> 00:27:17.969
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So that's the opportunity for us to then
start doing things like testing</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1154-2
00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:20.106
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>engagement with other business
stakeholders,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1154-3
00:27:20.106 --> 00:27:23.859
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>do some of that user acceptance testing
and then we're aiming for a go live in</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1154-4
00:27:23.859 --> 00:27:27.231
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the first week of September,
just a couple of key days just to kind of</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1154-5
00:27:27.231 --> 00:27:28.324
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>share with you as well.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1155-0
00:27:29.604 --> 00:27:33.289
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think you know there was some some
rates that matter yesterday, you know,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1155-1
00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:36.489
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>not waiting for the 1st of September to
sort of change behaviour.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1155-2
00:27:36.489 --> 00:27:40.320
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There was one you know that they get
multiple requests for example of you know</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1155-3
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.151
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>what are the time rates and what are you
know they get lots of questions where</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1155-4
00:27:44.151 --> 00:27:48.127
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>they sort of think well they could have
there is a standard rate card it's on the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1155-5
00:27:48.127 --> 00:27:48.564
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>interest.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1156-0
00:27:48.644 --> 00:27:51.460
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know, yes,
there might be things actually even now</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1156-1
00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.635
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>that you say, well,
actually this is part of the knowledge it</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1156-2
00:27:54.635 --> 00:27:57.657
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>exists. You know,
you don't have to wait till next year to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1156-3
00:27:57.657 --> 00:28:00.627
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>push that back,
but they could be maybe based on like our</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1156-4
00:28:00.627 --> 00:28:03.803
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>conversations that we had today that
probably exists already.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1156-5
00:28:03.803 --> 00:28:07.644
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You can divert them to a knowledge
article and get that behaviour started.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1157-0
00:28:08.044 --> 00:28:11.949
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>You know in the interim as a just
suggestion based on the things that we</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1157-1
00:28:11.949 --> 00:28:14.571
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>discussed today that are coming
downstream, the,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1157-2
00:28:14.571 --> 00:28:18.744
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the one last thing I was going to say.
So once we get the stories into a good</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1157-3
00:28:18.744 --> 00:28:22.971
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>state, we will go for an approval cycle.
So you know distributing the stories,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1157-4
00:28:22.971 --> 00:28:24.844
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>having yourself, Sandeep, etcetera.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1158-0
00:28:25.324 --> 00:28:28.482
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Reviewing those stories approving that
allows us to then start on that build</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1158-1
00:28:28.482 --> 00:28:31.354
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>activity as soon as possible.
Then it gives us an opportunity to kind</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1158-2
00:28:31.354 --> 00:28:33.815
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>of demo some of that functionality.
So it's not a sign off.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1158-3
00:28:33.815 --> 00:28:37.138
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Here's all the requirements we have to
wait until the end of you know that build</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1158-4
00:28:37.138 --> 00:28:39.107
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>cycle.
There'll be iterations that you can then</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1158-5
00:28:39.107 --> 00:28:42.142
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>start to review and have a look at.
Does that look, does that look right?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1158-6
00:28:42.142 --> 00:28:44.604
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Does it make sense? Yes. Happy.
Completely happy with that.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1159-0
00:28:44.924 --> 00:28:48.255
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Some of the requests we've actually,
I want to slightly tweak some of that</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1159-1
00:28:48.255 --> 00:28:50.787
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>functionality.
So we'll have opportunity to do that over</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1159-2
00:28:50.787 --> 00:28:53.674
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>the coming weeks as well.
And I think the first drop with you to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1159-3
00:28:53.674 --> 00:28:55.673
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>see the user stories is the week
commencing.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1159-4
00:28:55.673 --> 00:28:59.049
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I mean we've got to work on them,
we finish workshops next week and I think</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1159-5
00:28:59.049 --> 00:29:00.204
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it's probably one week or.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1160-0
00:29:00.844 --> 00:29:03.739
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>It'll be two weeks. Yeah,
we need to two weeks splitting out the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1160-1
00:29:03.739 --> 00:29:06.767
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>finance bits. That's one.
We need to kind of take away and then and</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1160-2
00:29:06.767 --> 00:29:09.084
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>then when you next,
expect to see the first output.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1162-0
00:29:12.844 --> 00:29:15.970
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Like I appreciate,
like many of us are actually coming to</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1162-1
00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:20.013
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>your team all at the same time,
so if you can just let us know, like, hey,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1162-2
00:29:20.013 --> 00:29:22.384
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we need because I know you've also got
BAU.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1162-3
00:29:22.384 --> 00:29:25.133
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So just let us know like can you bring it
forward,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1162-4
00:29:25.133 --> 00:29:28.691
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>can you move this a little and we can
flex your schedule as well,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1162-5
00:29:28.691 --> 00:29:31.764
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>not at the end of the month,
avoid the end of the month?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1163-0
00:29:32.484 --> 00:29:37.131
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Everybody's been pre warned. Listen,
and that's a really good point.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1163-1
00:29:37.131 --> 00:29:41.373
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>There will be a label.
So we all kind of do the first check on</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1163-2
00:29:41.373 --> 00:29:46.020
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>things then when it's ready to go we'll
get passed over to you guys.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1163-3
00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.186
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>I think when we get into the user story
piece,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1163-4
00:29:49.186 --> 00:29:52.284
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>it will be quite exciting actually
something.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1164-0
00:29:52.364 --> 00:29:56.210
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Really quite new if he's to get involved
in and we'll need to keep the momentum</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1164-1
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.614
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>going there,
so that's something we need to start</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1164-2
00:29:58.614 --> 00:30:01.258
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>thinking about.
How we do that and the team and manage</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1164-3
00:30:01.258 --> 00:30:05.105
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>work so that we've got some time to spend
on that. But some, like Sandeep says,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1164-4
00:30:05.105 --> 00:30:06.884
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we'll work that out. Yeah. Thank you.</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1165-0
00:30:08.004 --> 00:30:11.029
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>That was very enjoyable today. Thank you.
Any other questions?</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1165-1
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:14.486
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>Any other questions for us before we
close? I've seen on other clients,</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1165-2
00:30:14.486 --> 00:30:17.848
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>we've sometimes used, you know,
when you do the retrospectives or the</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1165-3
00:30:17.848 --> 00:30:21.593
<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>playback where they can see can we start
bringing in maybe some of the change</v>

99f8bbc7-cd29-4b95-ba8c-843968d8d758/1165-4
00:30:21.593 --> 00:30:25.579

<v Elsworth, Tim 14011>So it's just something to think about.</v>
