a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/126-1
00:24:00.794 --> 00:24:01.181
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/127-0
00:24:03.181 --> 00:24:07.715
<v Josh Sparkes>Let me switch to.
So I tried to put them into logical order</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/127-1
00:24:07.715 --> 00:24:11.568
<v Josh Sparkes>of starting,
so we're going to start with managing</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/127-2
00:24:11.568 --> 00:24:15.270
<v Josh Sparkes>vendors,
of which there were multiple processes.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/127-3
00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:18.821
<v Josh Sparkes>But I think you have the full processes
there.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/128-0
00:24:19.621 --> 00:24:25.924
<v Josh Sparkes>And consolidated it into one service and
again from this we'll probably look at</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/128-1
00:24:25.924 --> 00:24:30.729
<v Josh Sparkes>some localization,
but that be incorporated as the workflow.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/128-2
00:24:30.729 --> 00:24:35.141
<v Josh Sparkes>So maybe sorry you get the zoom,
the Zoom's gone crazy.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/129-0
00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:40.623
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that too zoomed out?
You see what new vendor request?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/129-1
00:24:40.623 --> 00:24:44.634
<v Josh Sparkes>I think supplier management comes under
that, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/129-2
00:24:44.634 --> 00:24:49.719
<v Josh Sparkes>and the workflow of onboarding them going
through the details of that,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/129-3
00:24:49.719 --> 00:24:52.941
<v Josh Sparkes>what is required for for them you also
have.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/130-0
00:24:53.541 --> 00:24:58.340
<v Josh Sparkes>Changes in that,
plus there's been announced Awa 6A Wax</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/130-1
00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.624
<v Josh Sparkes>reports.
I think it's triggered which I saw every</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/130-2
00:25:02.624 --> 00:25:09.394
<v Josh Sparkes>Friday and some questions around that.
But basically like on boarding that you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/130-3
00:25:09.394 --> 00:25:12.821
<v Josh Sparkes>did yesterday or when you remember it's.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/131-0
00:25:12.941 --> 00:25:16.071
<v Josh Sparkes>Some more onboarding or managing that
vendor?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/131-1
00:25:16.071 --> 00:25:21.445
<v Josh Sparkes>Would that be a fair assumption that we
consolidate the onboarding of a vendor</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/131-2
00:25:21.445 --> 00:25:26.956
<v Josh Sparkes>supplier as a consolidated service and
really it's discussing everywhere there's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/131-3
00:25:26.956 --> 00:25:30.901
<v Josh Sparkes>localizations and high level processes
that you do today.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/132-0
00:25:32.141 --> 00:25:34.711
<v Josh Sparkes>If you take the happy part,
probably at new,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/132-1
00:25:34.711 --> 00:25:39.221
<v Josh Sparkes>that's you know how you start with it on
boarding a new vendor stoat supplier.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/133-0
00:25:44.901 --> 00:25:50.734
<v Josh Sparkes>The vendor payee requests to onboard that
we get actually don't come directly from</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/133-1
00:25:50.734 --> 00:25:54.177
<v Josh Sparkes>someone.
It's automated through 3 E so we've got</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/133-2
00:25:54.177 --> 00:25:58.043
<v Josh Sparkes>two workflows.
How we can have a new vendor PE created</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/133-3
00:25:58.043 --> 00:26:02.821
<v Josh Sparkes>in 3 E 1st workflow is directly through P
to P procurement process.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/135-0
00:26:03.501 --> 00:26:08.244
<v Josh Sparkes>Where someone else is putting in a
request to add or update,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/135-1
00:26:08.244 --> 00:26:11.975
<v Josh Sparkes>which is lines four and six on the
spreadsheet.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/135-2
00:26:11.975 --> 00:26:17.106
<v Josh Sparkes>So someone else puts that information in
and sends a request off.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/135-3
00:26:17.106 --> 00:26:22.781
<v Josh Sparkes>Because AP is our roles and pick up that
request in three and review it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/136-0
00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:28.248
<v Josh Sparkes>So it doesn't touch or there's an
automatic notification that comes through</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/136-1
00:26:28.248 --> 00:26:33.792
<v Josh Sparkes>our system currently. Like we can e-mail,
but that's no one would be going into</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/136-2
00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:38.781
<v Josh Sparkes>that user like sending us an e-mail
directly. It's an automated e-mail.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/137-0
00:26:40.661 --> 00:26:46.261
<v Josh Sparkes>And then second workflow for onboarding
new event payees is just done through.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/138-0
00:26:48.621 --> 00:26:53.565
<v Josh Sparkes>Getting an invoice so we might get an
invoice where we haven't processed that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/138-1
00:26:53.565 --> 00:26:58.255
<v Josh Sparkes>for a particular vendor before.
We don't know that until we go to process</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/138-2
00:26:58.255 --> 00:27:01.804
<v Josh Sparkes>the invoice as well.
So there are actually not a lot of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/138-3
00:27:01.804 --> 00:27:04.846
<v Josh Sparkes>instances.
Let me know if I'm wrong or not that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/138-4
00:27:04.846 --> 00:27:07.381
<v Josh Sparkes>anyone from the business would actually.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/139-0
00:27:07.421 --> 00:27:11.559
<v Josh Sparkes>To tell us that we need to create a new
vendor payee, right.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/139-1
00:27:11.559 --> 00:27:16.647
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not something you proactively do
first. It's triggered by activities.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/139-2
00:27:16.647 --> 00:27:22.141
<v Josh Sparkes>As you talk 3 or the fact that you've
received the invoice. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/141-0
00:27:22.501 --> 00:27:28.042
<v Josh Sparkes>It's it's different to someone sending us
an invoice and asking us to process it,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/141-1
00:27:28.042 --> 00:27:33.042
<v Josh Sparkes>and most people won't know unless they're
going through our P2P workflow.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/141-2
00:27:33.042 --> 00:27:37.501
<v Josh Sparkes>Whether a vendor is new or not for us.
So a lot of it is just us.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/142-0
00:27:37.861 --> 00:27:43.128
<v Josh Sparkes>Knowing and understanding the processes
as to how we know whether a new one needs</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/142-1
00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:47.431
<v Josh Sparkes>to be created or not. OK,
so in that let's take the scenario where</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/142-2
00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:52.055
<v Josh Sparkes>you're driving that you know,
so you've got an invoice that needs to be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/142-3
00:27:52.055 --> 00:27:53.981
<v Josh Sparkes>paid and then you're going to.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/143-0
00:27:54.341 --> 00:27:57.402
<v Josh Sparkes>On board that vendor is that as it is
here,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/143-1
00:27:57.402 --> 00:28:01.714
<v Josh Sparkes>it's capturing that that is a activity
that needs to be done.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/143-2
00:28:01.714 --> 00:28:06.374
<v Josh Sparkes>So you're creating new vendor,
it's new whether it needs approval.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/143-3
00:28:06.374 --> 00:28:11.381
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that fair to say that in show will say
that you would create a task?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/144-0
00:28:11.741 --> 00:28:16.387
<v Josh Sparkes>And then that's processed and assigned to
different members of the team.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/144-1
00:28:16.387 --> 00:28:21.287
<v Josh Sparkes>The task is created by the invoice
getting sent to us and so essentially the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/144-2
00:28:21.287 --> 00:28:26.441
<v Josh Sparkes>process is adding an invoice into 3A and
if a new vendor pay needs to be created</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/144-3
00:28:26.441 --> 00:28:29.941
<v Josh Sparkes>off the back of that,
it's kind of like a sub process.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/145-0
00:28:31.541 --> 00:28:35.895
<v Josh Sparkes>Two different processes,
which is why we have two different kind</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/145-1
00:28:35.895 --> 00:28:40.182
<v Josh Sparkes>of processes on our MPL.
Two different process maps because not</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/145-2
00:28:40.182 --> 00:28:45.272
<v Josh Sparkes>all invoices need a new vendor payee.
It's kind of like an exception to the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/145-3
00:28:45.272 --> 00:28:48.353
<v Josh Sparkes>rule.
So we've separated those processes out.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/145-4
00:28:48.353 --> 00:28:48.621
<v Josh Sparkes>But.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/146-0
00:28:49.061 --> 00:28:54.189
<v Josh Sparkes>The creation of a new vendor pay is only
triggered most of the time is generally</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/146-1
00:28:54.189 --> 00:28:58.936
<v Josh Sparkes>triggered through processing an invoice
first OK because we've got managed</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/146-2
00:28:58.936 --> 00:29:01.975
<v Josh Sparkes>invoices,
of which there's a sort of a journey.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/146-3
00:29:01.975 --> 00:29:06.596
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm from what you're saying,
I wonder if that then becomes a sub task</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/146-4
00:29:06.596 --> 00:29:08.621
<v Josh Sparkes>or task of the managing invoice.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/147-0
00:29:08.701 --> 00:29:13.154
<v Josh Sparkes>Voice process rather than its unique
services. We sit here. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/147-1
00:29:13.154 --> 00:29:16.932
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that would be really helpful
because if we can,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/147-2
00:29:16.932 --> 00:29:22.261
<v Josh Sparkes>I think there's going to be quite a few
tough one or may hopefully agree that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/148-0
00:29:23.661 --> 00:29:29.923
<v Josh Sparkes>We might start off with categorising a
request. It's something specific,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/148-1
00:29:29.923 --> 00:29:33.783
<v Josh Sparkes>but it involves a second process or a
third.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/148-2
00:29:33.783 --> 00:29:39.101
<v Josh Sparkes>It changes as we go through adding an
invoice in or you know.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/149-0
00:29:39.261 --> 00:29:43.201
<v Josh Sparkes>Credit card applications.
It can go across a number of different</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/149-1
00:29:43.201 --> 00:29:46.414
<v Josh Sparkes>work flows,
so we have the possibility to categorise</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/149-2
00:29:46.414 --> 00:29:51.445
<v Josh Sparkes>something as a processing a new invoice
with some migrating. Yeah, sometimes good.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/149-3
00:29:51.445 --> 00:29:55.384
<v Josh Sparkes>Creating the vendor. Yeah.
And other activities that come out of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/149-4
00:29:55.384 --> 00:29:59.021
<v Josh Sparkes>that definitely.
And a lot of that categorization would be.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/150-0
00:29:59.221 --> 00:30:03.907
<v Josh Sparkes>Mostly beneficial to us internally,
it wouldn't really matter to the external</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/150-1
00:30:03.907 --> 00:30:08.112
<v Josh Sparkes>person that's sending us the invoice,
but it would help for us, sure,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/150-2
00:30:08.112 --> 00:30:12.557
<v Josh Sparkes>and how many you've set up in the month,
how many you've had to do, yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/150-3
00:30:12.557 --> 00:30:15.741
<v Josh Sparkes>impact on workloads,
impact on you know as you said.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/151-0
00:30:17.221 --> 00:30:20.315
<v Josh Sparkes>Receiving the invoice to paying that
invoice and the task that had to be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/151-1
00:30:20.315 --> 00:30:23.705
<v Josh Sparkes>completed to do that, yeah, definitely.
Even if it just comes down to the split</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/151-2
00:30:23.705 --> 00:30:27.053
<v Josh Sparkes>of how many invoices were just straight
up invoices or how many invoices moved</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/151-3
00:30:27.053 --> 00:30:29.341
<v Josh Sparkes>into a different workflow. Yeah,
that would be great.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/152-0
00:30:31.861 --> 00:30:32.141
<v Josh Sparkes>Honour.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/154-0
00:30:35.101 --> 00:30:37.974
<v Josh Sparkes>Name because the way it comes in to share,
well,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/154-1
00:30:37.974 --> 00:30:41.962
<v Josh Sparkes>just now we can only assign it one
category. But as Anna just said,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/154-2
00:30:41.962 --> 00:30:44.894
<v Josh Sparkes>it could go through a number of different
stages.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/154-3
00:30:44.894 --> 00:30:49.467
<v Josh Sparkes>So just now we can't capture it properly
because we can only assign it to one</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/154-4
00:30:49.467 --> 00:30:50.581
<v Josh Sparkes>category. So we've.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/155-0
00:30:51.021 --> 00:30:54.148
<v Josh Sparkes>We're maybe categorising it as a new
invoice,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/155-1
00:30:54.148 --> 00:30:59.109
<v Josh Sparkes>but in that process there's been
different processes so we can't capture</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/155-2
00:30:59.109 --> 00:31:04.071
<v Josh Sparkes>how long it's actually taken us to deal
with that ticket just now. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/155-3
00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:07.061
<v Josh Sparkes>And in that process that you described
you.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/156-0
00:31:07.821 --> 00:31:11.452
<v Josh Sparkes>Same person would handle it.
Or you can in service now the ability</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/156-1
00:31:11.452 --> 00:31:14.107
<v Josh Sparkes>that once you've closed it moves from one
state.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/156-2
00:31:14.107 --> 00:31:18.442
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be assigned to auto assign.
You know based on thresholds that you set.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/156-3
00:31:18.442 --> 00:31:22.668
<v Josh Sparkes>You know maybe this group of people set
up the vendor or it's assigned to one</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/156-4
00:31:22.668 --> 00:31:26.461
<v Josh Sparkes>person that does the end to end.
So you have that ability within the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/157-0
00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:32.607
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably fall out when we go into manage
invoicing based on the categories that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/157-1
00:31:32.607 --> 00:31:36.512
<v Josh Sparkes>you're mentioning,
it could be auto assigned based on the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/157-2
00:31:36.512 --> 00:31:41.897
<v Josh Sparkes>matrix that you could have as well. OK,
that's good. Just just wondering never,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/157-3
00:31:41.897 --> 00:31:42.301
<v Josh Sparkes>sorry.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/158-0
00:31:43.021 --> 00:31:46.483
<v Josh Sparkes>So with the the new new vendor that
always come through,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/158-1
00:31:46.483 --> 00:31:51.221
<v Josh Sparkes>that roots of a new invoice being added
or is there possibility of proactive?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/159-0
00:31:53.861 --> 00:31:59.475
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't need to set that with the second
option and the first option of two</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/159-1
00:31:59.475 --> 00:32:03.906
<v Josh Sparkes>different workflows,
so it's either through the new invoice</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/159-2
00:32:03.906 --> 00:32:09.815
<v Josh Sparkes>process which I would categorise right
now as that vendor pay intake or the 2nd</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/159-3
00:32:09.815 --> 00:32:11.661
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow is that someone.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/160-0
00:32:12.381 --> 00:32:14.850
<v Josh Sparkes>Else,
within the firm is requesting to add a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/160-1
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.922
<v Josh Sparkes>new vendor payee throughout procurement P
to P process,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/160-2
00:32:17.922 --> 00:32:22.256
<v Josh Sparkes>which is where we get the update vendor
and new vendor request items on there.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/160-3
00:32:22.256 --> 00:32:26.699
<v Josh Sparkes>Perfect anything that we haven't touched
on is the I back which Lorna might need</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/160-4
00:32:26.699 --> 00:32:27.741
<v Josh Sparkes>to talk more about.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/161-0
00:32:28.421 --> 00:32:32.233
<v Mark Sedge>Is that how are we saying? Sorry.
Just jumping back to that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/161-1
00:32:32.233 --> 00:32:37.294
<v Mark Sedge>So at the point of which the P2P process
starts where you, you know, in essence,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/161-2
00:32:37.294 --> 00:32:40.293
<v Mark Sedge>identify the vendor,
you're going to work with,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/161-3
00:32:40.293 --> 00:32:45.479
<v Mark Sedge>that will be a logical trigger obviously
to get it on the system so that you don't</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/161-4
00:32:45.479 --> 00:32:47.541
<v Mark Sedge>have to do it reactively when an.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/163-0
00:32:47.621 --> 00:32:51.550
<v Mark Sedge>Voice lands.
Are we saying that that's that's slightly</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/163-1
00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:57.193
<v Mark Sedge>sub optimal at the moment in the sense
that you're not everything goes through</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/163-2
00:32:57.193 --> 00:32:58.621
<v Mark Sedge>that P to P process?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/166-0
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:07.163
<v Josh Sparkes>It's 5050, to be honest.
It does save up a bit of work of not</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/166-1
00:33:07.163 --> 00:33:11.005
<v Josh Sparkes>having to create new vendor payees all
the time,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/166-2
00:33:11.005 --> 00:33:17.277
<v Josh Sparkes>but there's still a bit of work involved,
and the externals don't always get it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/166-3
00:33:17.277 --> 00:33:18.061
<v Josh Sparkes>right. So.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/168-0
00:33:18.941 --> 00:33:21.556
<v Josh Sparkes>It's kind of,
it would be great if we could have a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/168-1
00:33:21.556 --> 00:33:25.095
<v Josh Sparkes>little bit more control over adding all
the vendor payees ourselves.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/167-0
00:33:22.181 --> 00:33:22.581
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/168-2
00:33:25.095 --> 00:33:28.017
<v Josh Sparkes>But at the same time,
it also does save us more time for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/168-3
00:33:28.017 --> 00:33:30.581
<v Josh Sparkes>someone else to do most of that hard work
for us.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/170-0
00:33:30.901 --> 00:33:33.843
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, you'd want to fix it right up front,
wouldn't you?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/170-1
00:33:33.843 --> 00:33:37.455
<v Mark Sedge>So that you you didn't have to react.
And when you say the externals,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/169-0
00:33:33.901 --> 00:33:34.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/170-2
00:33:37.455 --> 00:33:39.261
<v Mark Sedge>who do you mean by those externals?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/172-0
00:33:40.301 --> 00:33:44.034
<v Josh Sparkes>External to AP,
so like our when I say external</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/172-1
00:33:44.034 --> 00:33:50.333
<v Josh Sparkes>stakeholders more often than not they're
return referring to like internal Asher</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/171-0
00:33:49.621 --> 00:33:50.781
<v Mark Sedge>They're like partners.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/172-2
00:33:50.333 --> 00:33:54.221
<v Josh Sparkes>staff. It's just external to AP.
Yeah so because.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/173-0
00:33:52.741 --> 00:33:56.939
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, OK. Understood. So again,
if they if they were, if they were,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/173-1
00:33:56.939 --> 00:34:02.062
<v Mark Sedge>if there was some appropriate controls to
ensure that they did what they needed to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/173-2
00:34:02.062 --> 00:34:05.086
<v Mark Sedge>upfront,
it would reduce your failure demand and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/173-3
00:34:05.086 --> 00:34:07.061
<v Mark Sedge>reactive work downstream, right.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/174-0
00:34:08.261 --> 00:34:08.541
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/175-0
00:34:09.021 --> 00:34:10.421
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. OK. Thank you.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/176-0
00:34:13.261 --> 00:34:16.609
<v Josh Sparkes>Right. But in the event that, you know,
sorry you have,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/176-1
00:34:16.609 --> 00:34:19.896
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just going to ask one more question
on that PTP.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/176-2
00:34:19.896 --> 00:34:24.439
<v Josh Sparkes>But so we how does that commence?
The team is that an automated e-mail that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/176-3
00:34:24.439 --> 00:34:28.444
<v Josh Sparkes>comes in from three, OK,
so that's something that we probably want</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/176-4
00:34:28.444 --> 00:34:29.101
<v Josh Sparkes>to capture.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/177-0
00:34:29.341 --> 00:34:30.061
<v Josh Sparkes>Cool, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/178-0
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:34.545
<v Mark Sedge>I think I think that's one of the 32 odd
that come into Cherwell from various</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/178-1
00:34:34.545 --> 00:34:37.739
<v Mark Sedge>sources.
So you know that's one of the things that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/178-2
00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:42.310
<v Mark Sedge>we'd certainly like to explore,
whether there's something we can do more</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/178-3
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:43.061
<v Mark Sedge>efficiently.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/179-0
00:34:43.741 --> 00:34:46.602
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, definitely.
If anyone has looked at usher. Well,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/179-1
00:34:46.602 --> 00:34:50.036
<v Josh Sparkes>the tickets all come up as an action
required. New vendor, payee,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/179-2
00:34:50.036 --> 00:34:52.689
<v Josh Sparkes>request or action required. Update.
Vendor. Payee.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/179-3
00:34:52.689 --> 00:34:55.914
<v Josh Sparkes>That's the subject for all of them.
It's all automated. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/179-4
00:34:55.914 --> 00:34:59.400
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm going to ask you what the subject
header. It do differentiate.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/179-5
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.781
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not just new requests,
but you do get that subject heading.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/180-0
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:06.387
<v Josh Sparkes>Within that notification,
every time it's consistent,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/180-1
00:35:06.387 --> 00:35:09.369
<v Josh Sparkes>so we can built it out and pick up what
we need.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/180-2
00:35:09.369 --> 00:35:13.993
<v Josh Sparkes>If we're looking at how many show all
requests of like the automated emails</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/180-3
00:35:13.993 --> 00:35:17.461
<v Josh Sparkes>that we've had in a month,
it's really easy to identify.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/181-0
00:35:19.741 --> 00:35:25.447
<v Josh Sparkes>That's not probably we can invest it
based on the back of that notification to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/182-0
00:35:25.261 --> 00:35:30.987
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, that's that's exactly it's it. It,
Parikh and I already obviously talking to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/181-1
00:35:25.447 --> 00:35:27.541
<v Josh Sparkes>trigger a task already, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/182-1
00:35:30.987 --> 00:35:36.781
<v Mark Sedge>Alex and the broader teams about what you
know what what level of feeds come out of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/182-2
00:35:36.781 --> 00:35:40.989
<v Mark Sedge>those systems. But yeah,
it's certainly something we need to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/182-3
00:35:40.989 --> 00:35:41.541
<v Mark Sedge>explore.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/183-0
00:35:42.701 --> 00:35:47.699
<v Mark Sedge>Because I think there's we could just be
smarter and then what we want to be able</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/183-1
00:35:47.699 --> 00:35:52.576
<v Mark Sedge>to do is gather enough metrics that we
can show the level of failure demand and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/183-2
00:35:52.576 --> 00:35:57.635
<v Mark Sedge>in essence, which externals, for example,
are not maybe as effective as they could</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/183-3
00:35:57.635 --> 00:36:00.317
<v Mark Sedge>be.
And then again for that for the benefit</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/183-4
00:36:00.317 --> 00:36:01.901
<v Mark Sedge>of the whole organisation.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/184-0
00:36:01.981 --> 00:36:05.121
<v Mark Sedge>Organisation what could be done to
incentivize?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/184-1
00:36:05.121 --> 00:36:07.541
<v Mark Sedge>Perhaps those communities to do that?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/185-0
00:36:09.421 --> 00:36:14.470
<v Josh Sparkes>It may be our failed to note that the
original request retailers that the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/185-1
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:19.996
<v Josh Sparkes>vendor is waiting approval doesn't come
in to share well just now it comes on to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/185-2
00:36:19.996 --> 00:36:25.045
<v Josh Sparkes>the 3E on the action list to see that
there is a vendor sitting week that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/185-3
00:36:25.045 --> 00:36:27.501
<v Josh Sparkes>someone has created in the business.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/187-0
00:36:27.941 --> 00:36:33.660
<v Josh Sparkes>And it comes to the AP role initially.
So then we have to go in and approve it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/186-0
00:36:32.181 --> 00:36:32.701
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/187-1
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.062
<v Josh Sparkes>as such.
And then it goes to the EP supervisor</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/187-2
00:36:37.062 --> 00:36:43.070
<v Josh Sparkes>role and that is when the ticket goes on
to share will to pay that the approver or</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/187-3
00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:47.341
<v Josh Sparkes>the supervisor line manager,
the EP manager basically has.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/190-0
00:36:47.421 --> 00:36:51.944
<v Josh Sparkes>To then one and do the final approval.
So that's the only notification that goes</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/190-1
00:36:51.944 --> 00:36:56.077
<v Josh Sparkes>through share will. I don't know.
There's one that goes to the user if we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/188-0
00:36:53.741 --> 00:36:54.181
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, there's.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/190-2
00:36:56.077 --> 00:36:59.818
<v Josh Sparkes>reject it for any reason.
So if the the upper vendor that we maybe</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/190-3
00:36:59.818 --> 00:37:04.229
<v Josh Sparkes>already have and they haven't and we
return that I'm not sure we don't see the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/190-4
00:37:04.229 --> 00:37:06.295
<v Josh Sparkes>ones,
but I don't know if they get a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/190-5
00:37:06.295 --> 00:37:07.021
<v Josh Sparkes>notification.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/191-0
00:37:07.181 --> 00:37:09.623
<v Josh Sparkes>That,
but the only way for us that comes</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/189-0
00:37:07.821 --> 00:37:08.461
<v Mark Sedge>I think that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/191-1
00:37:09.623 --> 00:37:12.541
<v Josh Sparkes>through to share well is for the final
approval.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/192-0
00:37:13.301 --> 00:37:17.801
<v Mark Sedge>There's an opportunity, I think,
to lift the lid on that and just look at</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/192-1
00:37:17.801 --> 00:37:20.415
<v Mark Sedge>what,
whether there's anything that we can</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/192-2
00:37:20.415 --> 00:37:24.793
<v Mark Sedge>support with on that because ultimately
you want you want to, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/192-3
00:37:24.793 --> 00:37:28.685
<v Mark Sedge>again it comes back to,
you want the earliest notification that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/192-4
00:37:28.685 --> 00:37:32.941
<v Mark Sedge>there's some actions so that you're not.
You haven't got a a complex.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/193-0
00:37:33.061 --> 00:37:38.519
<v Mark Sedge>Process downstream to cater for, you know,
lack of insight upstream,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/193-1
00:37:38.519 --> 00:37:40.101
<v Mark Sedge>if that makes sense.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/194-0
00:37:41.221 --> 00:37:45.900
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, building on what Lorna said.
Because we do get the notifications</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/194-1
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:50.380
<v Josh Sparkes>through three directly as well.
There's something that pops up very</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/194-2
00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:55.652
<v Josh Sparkes>visible in what we call an action list.
So the e-mail notifications are nice to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/194-3
00:37:55.652 --> 00:37:55.981
<v Josh Sparkes>have.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/195-0
00:37:56.381 --> 00:38:00.821
<v Josh Sparkes>But I wouldn't say we necessarily rely on
them on having them so.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/197-0
00:38:02.181 --> 00:38:04.798
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's,
if it's going to be easier if it's an</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/197-1
00:38:04.798 --> 00:38:07.525
<v Josh Sparkes>option,
we can have a look at maybe stopping the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/197-2
00:38:07.525 --> 00:38:12.257
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail notifications because we know that
we need to action it through three anyway.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/197-3
00:38:12.257 --> 00:38:15.375
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what that's generally what our
first trigger is.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/197-4
00:38:15.375 --> 00:38:19.661
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the automatic emails are kind of
secondary or supplementary for us.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/196-0
00:38:15.701 --> 00:38:15.981
<v Mark Sedge>Right.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/199-0
00:38:20.021 --> 00:38:22.525
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I mean this is about managing your</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/199-1
00:38:22.525 --> 00:38:26.983
<v Josh Sparkes>workload, isn't it? And having foresight,
you know? Yeah. For the teams,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/199-2
00:38:26.983 --> 00:38:31.746
<v Josh Sparkes>for all the other activities that we can
see that you do well in all honesty,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/199-3
00:38:31.746 --> 00:38:35.898
<v Josh Sparkes>the automatic emails just create extra
tickets for us anyway. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/198-0
00:38:34.901 --> 00:38:35.861
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, exactly.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/199-4
00:38:35.898 --> 00:38:39.501
<v Josh Sparkes>it is just extra work for us to kind of
pick up and close.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/200-0
00:38:39.621 --> 00:38:42.819
<v Josh Sparkes>The ticket and it doesn't take time,
but it's.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/200-1
00:38:42.819 --> 00:38:46.220
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't always feel personally from from
my team.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/200-2
00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:51.731
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't feel like it's reflective of the
work that's going into it because we're</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/200-3
00:38:51.731 --> 00:38:56.901
<v Josh Sparkes>not always the one that are actioning it.
The emails triggered to go, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/201-0
00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:56.987
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, it's a moot point, really, isn't it?
It's almost.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/201-1
00:38:56.987 --> 00:39:01.067
<v Mark Sedge>It almost gives you a false measure
because you're doing the activities you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/201-2
00:39:01.067 --> 00:39:04.448
<v Mark Sedge>say from the, from the real alert.
If you like to take action,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/201-3
00:39:04.448 --> 00:39:08.581
<v Mark Sedge>and then you've got this subsidiary piece
where you might close it, open it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/202-0
00:39:09.221 --> 00:39:12.268
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
review close it and it just is a false</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/202-1
00:39:12.268 --> 00:39:15.316
<v Mark Sedge>metric.
So I think where there's the opportunity</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/202-2
00:39:15.316 --> 00:39:20.104
<v Mark Sedge>and I don't know if this is a design
principle that we might apply that says</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/202-3
00:39:20.104 --> 00:39:23.400
<v Mark Sedge>if you're,
if you're actioning something directly in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/202-4
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.581
<v Mark Sedge>the system like 3E.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/203-0
00:39:24.981 --> 00:39:27.403
<v Mark Sedge>Any debt,
any other alerts that are just a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/203-1
00:39:27.403 --> 00:39:30.557
<v Mark Sedge>duplicate of that,
IE you've already been triggered and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/203-2
00:39:30.557 --> 00:39:33.880
<v Mark Sedge>taking the action,
we should just cease because it adds no</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/203-3
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.442
<v Mark Sedge>value to you and then the only time that
we would look to say do we do something</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/203-4
00:39:38.442 --> 00:39:42.948
<v Mark Sedge>to a level of betterment would be if you
have something that you want triggered</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/203-5
00:39:42.948 --> 00:39:44.581
<v Mark Sedge>where it goes to multi party.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/205-0
00:39:45.141 --> 00:39:49.580
<v Mark Sedge>That you can leverage some of
servicenow's workflow capabilities to get</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/205-1
00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:54.265
<v Mark Sedge>multitask to multi people to take action.
So those are the sorts of things.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/205-2
00:39:54.265 --> 00:39:58.642
<v Mark Sedge>But clearly we should be turning off
anything that just gives you work</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/205-3
00:39:58.642 --> 00:39:59.381
<v Mark Sedge>pointlessly.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/204-0
00:40:00.421 --> 00:40:00.661
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/206-0
00:40:01.981 --> 00:40:02.381
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/207-0
00:40:02.341 --> 00:40:07.470
<v Josh Sparkes>And on and on that e-mail that you get,
is there any localization you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/207-1
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:11.114
<v Josh Sparkes>so does it,
is it enough detail in there that you can</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/207-2
00:40:11.114 --> 00:40:14.218
<v Josh Sparkes>say,
oh this this team will be handling it or</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/207-3
00:40:14.218 --> 00:40:18.941
<v Josh Sparkes>there any local variations afterwards,
is there any way in which you?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/208-0
00:40:19.341 --> 00:40:22.446
<v Josh Sparkes>Manage or don't think differently with
those, no.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/208-1
00:40:22.446 --> 00:40:25.240
<v Josh Sparkes>So it'll be a global process of. Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/208-2
00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:30.269
<v Josh Sparkes>All all of the details that's in e-mail
is in three and Australia and UK are the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/208-3
00:40:30.269 --> 00:40:33.621
<v Josh Sparkes>only teams that get the notifications.
So all of the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/210-0
00:40:34.661 --> 00:40:40.094
<v Josh Sparkes>New new vendor payee or update of vendor
payee requests globally come through US.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/210-1
00:40:40.094 --> 00:40:44.599
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, so I think the e-mail, the e-mail,
the supplementary, the work,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/210-2
00:40:44.599 --> 00:40:50.031
<v Josh Sparkes>everything's available in three E we've
got a workflow table in three E we can do</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/210-3
00:40:50.031 --> 00:40:51.621
<v Josh Sparkes>everything through that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/211-0
00:40:52.101 --> 00:40:54.955
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
So that's the update and the new perfect,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/211-1
00:40:54.955 --> 00:40:55.141
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/212-0
00:41:03.221 --> 00:41:08.198
<v Josh Sparkes>So when we talk about P2P,
we have to be slightly kind of like</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/212-1
00:41:08.198 --> 00:41:11.990
<v Josh Sparkes>careful,
I would say current processes that the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/212-2
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:15.940
<v Josh Sparkes>procurement team,
the procurement guys and ashes,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/212-3
00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:22.181
<v Josh Sparkes>they're using 3 as a system to to kind of
like initiate the vendor setups and.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/213-0
00:41:22.381 --> 00:41:28.435
<v Josh Sparkes>Under changes and the vendor process,
that piece of technical process is gonna</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/213-1
00:41:28.435 --> 00:41:33.953
<v Josh Sparkes>go away in March 26 because three is
getting upgraded to a new version.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/213-2
00:41:33.953 --> 00:41:38.781
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know if you guys have heard that,
but it's one of the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/214-0
00:41:39.141 --> 00:41:44.568
<v Josh Sparkes>Key project for the farm as well,
and that procurement kind of like walk</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/214-1
00:41:44.568 --> 00:41:49.028
<v Josh Sparkes>around which was put in 3D is not gonna
be there available.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/214-2
00:41:49.028 --> 00:41:54.678
<v Josh Sparkes>So basically there will be a period of
time where procurement piece will be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/214-3
00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:55.941
<v Josh Sparkes>handled manually.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/215-0
00:41:56.661 --> 00:42:01.089
<v Josh Sparkes>But the firm has approved new P2P vendor
to be set up.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/215-1
00:42:01.089 --> 00:42:07.046
<v Josh Sparkes>That one would a new P2P vendor,
so that would what I hear and what what?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/215-2
00:42:07.046 --> 00:42:13.084
<v Josh Sparkes>Whatever we have been discussing at this
stage that P2P system will not be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/215-3
00:42:13.084 --> 00:42:15.901
<v Josh Sparkes>integrated with three so basically.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/216-0
00:42:15.981 --> 00:42:20.352
<v Josh Sparkes>The P to P is coming out of three E
completely and you're getting a new</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/216-1
00:42:20.352 --> 00:42:23.327
<v Josh Sparkes>system,
new new vendor and then the AP processes</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/216-2
00:42:23.327 --> 00:42:26.301
<v Josh Sparkes>are gonna be driven with that new P to P
vendor.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/217-0
00:42:27.661 --> 00:42:32.871
<v Josh Sparkes>So the reason is because I know as I was
asked me specifically to raise this point</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/217-1
00:42:32.871 --> 00:42:36.009
<v Josh Sparkes>because yes,
this is as is event as you said Josh</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/217-2
00:42:36.009 --> 00:42:41.344
<v Josh Sparkes>before we have to look at the present yes,
but the P to P side or the AP side of the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/217-3
00:42:41.344 --> 00:42:45.172
<v Josh Sparkes>process is kind of like might be changing
very soon as well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/217-4
00:42:45.172 --> 00:42:46.741
<v Josh Sparkes>If we go ahead with that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/218-0
00:42:48.381 --> 00:42:52.587
<v Josh Sparkes>On a different note,
what we're trying to do is we're trying</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/218-1
00:42:52.587 --> 00:42:58.309
<v Josh Sparkes>to understand what the new vendor portal
system will offer us because currently we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/218-2
00:42:58.309 --> 00:43:03.686
<v Josh Sparkes>house everything in three years well.
So we also don't want our AP process to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/218-3
00:43:03.686 --> 00:43:06.581
<v Josh Sparkes>be done in the new P2P portal and also 3E.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/219-0
00:43:06.981 --> 00:43:07.581
<v Josh Sparkes>So if.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/220-0
00:43:08.941 --> 00:43:14.191
<v Josh Sparkes>If the new portal is gonna be better,
then there might be a chance that we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/220-1
00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:17.761
<v Josh Sparkes>might do our AP in that new winter portal
as well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/220-2
00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:21.191
<v Josh Sparkes>But I think again that is your upstream
process.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/220-3
00:43:21.191 --> 00:43:24.621
<v Josh Sparkes>So it should not change like from a
service now.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/221-0
00:43:25.421 --> 00:43:27.893
<v Josh Sparkes>Service what we should be getting,
but yes,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/221-1
00:43:27.893 --> 00:43:31.880
<v Josh Sparkes>like when we're talking from IT
perspective technical perspective that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/221-2
00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:36.486
<v Josh Sparkes>the integrations of the systems and then
how it will look in future highly likely</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/221-3
00:43:36.486 --> 00:43:39.631
<v Josh Sparkes>it will change,
it will not be three or should in March</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/221-4
00:43:39.631 --> 00:43:43.619
<v Josh Sparkes>onwards you know understood yeah we
really need we do need to consider</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/221-5
00:43:43.619 --> 00:43:44.461
<v Josh Sparkes>September 2020.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/222-0
00:43:44.701 --> 00:43:47.381
<v Josh Sparkes>26 So if you're,
if you're the process is changing,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/222-1
00:43:47.381 --> 00:43:51.451
<v Josh Sparkes>your tech is changing with it as well,
then we need to incorporate that. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/222-2
00:43:51.451 --> 00:43:53.873
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
our station actually with the team later</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/222-3
00:43:53.873 --> 00:43:57.841
<v Josh Sparkes>last week to pick up on exactly that
because as much as it's changing in 26,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/222-4
00:43:57.841 --> 00:43:59.541
<v Josh Sparkes>we also know it's changing in 27.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/223-0
00:43:59.781 --> 00:44:03.999
<v Josh Sparkes>But I think it would be really good to
obviously stay connected because you guys</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/223-1
00:44:03.999 --> 00:44:07.643
<v Josh Sparkes>are in terms of decoupling that and
because why we may not be able to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/223-2
00:44:07.643 --> 00:44:11.548
<v Josh Sparkes>integrate definitely with you know
straight into three if three is pushing</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/223-3
00:44:11.548 --> 00:44:14.412
<v Josh Sparkes>that data somewhere else,
CDP or whatever it might be,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/223-4
00:44:14.412 --> 00:44:15.661
<v Josh Sparkes>that might be an option.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/224-0
00:44:16.501 --> 00:44:19.958
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. And. And so, yeah,
I'm just going out of this on stable</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/224-1
00:44:19.958 --> 00:44:22.299
<v Josh Sparkes>topic.
I think the guys would have raised</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/224-2
00:44:22.299 --> 00:44:26.759
<v Josh Sparkes>yesterday as well about E billing that
they are also getting like you know this</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/224-3
00:44:26.759 --> 00:44:30.661
<v Josh Sparkes>how the new European regulations are
there, that there will be a new.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/225-0
00:44:30.941 --> 00:44:33.729
<v Josh Sparkes>Portal,
which will be there for uploading all</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/225-1
00:44:33.729 --> 00:44:36.881
<v Josh Sparkes>sort of invoices.
I don't know if they mentioned it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/225-2
00:44:36.881 --> 00:44:41.244
<v Josh Sparkes>yesterday. Yeah. No we didn't.
They mentioned the the different portals</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/225-3
00:44:41.244 --> 00:44:44.941
<v Josh Sparkes>that they're they mentioned all the
different portals. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/225-4
00:44:44.941 --> 00:44:46.941
<v Josh Sparkes>So whatever inventions we upload.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/226-0
00:44:47.341 --> 00:44:50.905
<v Josh Sparkes>In AP and in Eber,
like any invoice coming in and going out,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/226-1
00:44:50.905 --> 00:44:54.996
<v Josh Sparkes>it has to go through one centralised
portal which access will attain.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/226-2
00:44:54.996 --> 00:44:59.086
<v Josh Sparkes>You know for their services.
It's a regulatory requirement and Europe</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/226-3
00:44:59.086 --> 00:45:02.299
<v Josh Sparkes>coming forward.
So it's like Belgium or actually going</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/226-4
00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:04.461
<v Josh Sparkes>live or it has already been live now.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/227-0
00:45:05.501 --> 00:45:08.947
<v Josh Sparkes>But I don't know if they've mentioned,
but if not then I can pick up.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/227-1
00:45:08.947 --> 00:45:12.049
<v Josh Sparkes>They do later on. They didn't. Obviously,
I grabbed, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/227-2
00:45:12.049 --> 00:45:15.938
<v Josh Sparkes>if this morning because definitely we
didn't need to do a we break out on that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/227-3
00:45:15.938 --> 00:45:19.630
<v Josh Sparkes>to see. Yes, exactly just likely.
So you don't get the flood of rejections</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/227-4
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:22.092
<v Josh Sparkes>that. Yeah.
So that's slightly out of this topic.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/227-5
00:45:22.092 --> 00:45:24.701
<v Josh Sparkes>But again when we talk about from an IT
perspective.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/228-0
00:45:24.941 --> 00:45:29.193
<v Josh Sparkes>Our system integrations B2B and that yes
from AD com are the two new ones which</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/228-1
00:45:29.193 --> 00:45:32.914
<v Josh Sparkes>going to be integrated from by ServiceNow
as well. Yeah. No that yes,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/228-2
00:45:32.914 --> 00:45:35.518
<v Josh Sparkes>you'll be good.
So come to use the two use cases</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/228-3
00:45:35.518 --> 00:45:39.823
<v Josh Sparkes>effectively and just have that capture
because we need to think about what's the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/228-4
00:45:39.823 --> 00:45:43.810
<v Josh Sparkes>right solution to then support that
solution that comes into here as well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/228-5
00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:44.341
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/229-0
00:45:45.421 --> 00:45:49.779
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh yeah, we can sit back quickly into IT.
So you know side,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/229-1
00:45:49.779 --> 00:45:53.411
<v Josh Sparkes>whereas I suppose from this side of the
business,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/229-2
00:45:53.411 --> 00:45:59.221
<v Josh Sparkes>you know your activity and managing that
service for you to handle new vendors.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/230-0
00:45:59.741 --> 00:46:03.822
<v Josh Sparkes>And then park that integration counsellor
work in the background feed.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/230-1
00:46:03.822 --> 00:46:07.674
<v Josh Sparkes>But this is the upfront of managing your
work, looking at service,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/230-2
00:46:07.674 --> 00:46:10.433
<v Josh Sparkes>how you're more than new vendors. So,
but yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/230-3
00:46:10.433 --> 00:46:14.341
<v Josh Sparkes>all of those misinformation providers,
you know, Paramount to that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/231-0
00:46:18.061 --> 00:46:22.193
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. So that's very helpful for and.
I just wanted to check.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/231-1
00:46:22.193 --> 00:46:26.118
<v Josh Sparkes>So your second method when you do it on
the new invoice,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/231-2
00:46:26.118 --> 00:46:31.696
<v Josh Sparkes>but I said what I also wanted to catch on
is we've done the new and amend on the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/231-3
00:46:31.696 --> 00:46:34.381
<v Josh Sparkes>three sides PC but also the amendments.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/232-0
00:46:34.861 --> 00:46:39.804
<v Josh Sparkes>You may have to handle so you talk about
new vendor on your second process where</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/232-1
00:46:39.804 --> 00:46:44.686
<v Josh Sparkes>you're doing it based on a new invoice,
but you have a new when you also have a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/232-2
00:46:44.686 --> 00:46:48.897
<v Josh Sparkes>menus through that process,
your second process where OK so you have</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/232-3
00:46:48.897 --> 00:46:52.742
<v Josh Sparkes>to manage that as well.
So that could service could take that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/232-4
00:46:52.742 --> 00:46:53.901
<v Josh Sparkes>So when you bought.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/233-0
00:46:54.261 --> 00:46:58.601
<v Josh Sparkes>And the new or amends based on possibly
the change of the invoice,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/233-1
00:46:58.601 --> 00:47:02.358
<v Josh Sparkes>whether that's what the change might be,
contact details,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/233-2
00:47:02.358 --> 00:47:06.051
<v Josh Sparkes>address or yeah most commonly bank
details bank details.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/233-3
00:47:06.051 --> 00:47:10.261
<v Josh Sparkes>So change of bank details for suppliers,
yeah. Again like if we.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/234-0
00:47:11.301 --> 00:47:17.421
<v Josh Sparkes>I guess going through the conversation,
the 3A automated process through P2P.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/235-0
00:47:19.061 --> 00:47:25.362
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably easy to take it off the table as
part of service now because it's not</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/235-1
00:47:25.362 --> 00:47:31.821
<v Josh Sparkes>going to be helpful for us. But yeah,
if we go through the new invoice workflow.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/236-0
00:47:33.461 --> 00:47:38.228
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll either let's check bank details on
an invoice that we get against what we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/236-1
00:47:38.228 --> 00:47:42.757
<v Josh Sparkes>have in the system and then we have our
own manual check that we have to go</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/236-2
00:47:42.757 --> 00:47:45.617
<v Josh Sparkes>through or we do.
We can sometimes get a formal</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/236-3
00:47:45.617 --> 00:47:48.954
<v Josh Sparkes>notification from vendors,
from suppliers to say, yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/236-4
00:47:48.954 --> 00:47:50.861
<v Josh Sparkes>we're changing our bank details.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/237-0
00:47:51.541 --> 00:47:56.187
<v Josh Sparkes>I would say that's less common than just
checking the bank details on the invoice</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/237-1
00:47:56.187 --> 00:48:00.549
<v Josh Sparkes>and we we have to make sure that it's
checked against our system and then do</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/237-2
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:02.701
<v Josh Sparkes>our offline manual cheques after that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/238-0
00:48:04.021 --> 00:48:04.461
<v Josh Sparkes>It's.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/239-0
00:48:07.181 --> 00:48:11.327
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, we can incorporate that.
You said part of that managing the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/239-1
00:48:11.327 --> 00:48:16.301
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice or mark correctly I'm wrong.
In ServiceNow, you can create a subtask.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/240-0
00:48:17.941 --> 00:48:21.826
<v Josh Sparkes>Part of that to amends those details with
bank details with approval,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/240-1
00:48:21.826 --> 00:48:25.656
<v Josh Sparkes>presumably with an approval.
But for those you're not changing it to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/240-2
00:48:25.656 --> 00:48:29.319
<v Josh Sparkes>your own bank details,
so you know it has to be enough, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/240-3
00:48:29.319 --> 00:48:32.427
<v Josh Sparkes>so it's peer reviews and approve. Yeah.
Sign off. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/240-4
00:48:32.427 --> 00:48:33.981
<v Josh Sparkes>I think if we can build the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/241-0
00:48:35.061 --> 00:48:38.741
<v Josh Sparkes>New vend,
like the vendor intake into the new</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/241-1
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:43.381
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice workflow.
That would be a lot easier because that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/241-2
00:48:43.381 --> 00:48:47.941
<v Josh Sparkes>works with our process and our workflow
is a lot better.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/241-3
00:48:47.941 --> 00:48:50.421
<v Josh Sparkes>The Arax report is a scheduled.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/242-0
00:48:51.101 --> 00:48:54.221
<v Josh Sparkes>Request in shower at the moment because
there's no.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/243-0
00:48:55.821 --> 00:49:00.856
<v Josh Sparkes>There's no external request outside AP
that someone tells AP to run this report</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/243-1
00:49:00.856 --> 00:49:04.569
<v Josh Sparkes>or do anything with it.
I have some questions on that one,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/243-2
00:49:04.569 --> 00:49:09.540
<v Josh Sparkes>so that is that an e-mail that you get is
it for the backs? Invoicing is that,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/243-3
00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:13.002
<v Josh Sparkes>that's yeah.
So the the e-mail that sends share e-mail</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/243-4
00:49:13.002 --> 00:49:15.141
<v Josh Sparkes>just now is the scheduled request.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/244-0
00:49:15.221 --> 00:49:20.265
<v Josh Sparkes>So we don't get a notification like
e-mail as such as a scheduled request to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/244-1
00:49:20.265 --> 00:49:25.505
<v Josh Sparkes>remind us on a Friday to go on to the
banking portal and anybody that's changed</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/244-2
00:49:25.505 --> 00:49:30.942
<v Josh Sparkes>their bank details, it gives us a report.
So that when we can update the system so</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/244-3
00:49:30.942 --> 00:49:34.741
<v Josh Sparkes>that the bank details are changed so that
their expenses.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/245-0
00:49:34.821 --> 00:49:40.082
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's safe to get paid into the correct
account, so it's not a specific process,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/245-1
00:49:40.082 --> 00:49:44.899
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's like a request for us as a
remainder of that calendar event. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/245-2
00:49:44.899 --> 00:49:49.970
<v Josh Sparkes>being automated or something that we,
it's a general task that's been estimated</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/245-3
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:51.301
<v Josh Sparkes>greatly every Friday.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/246-0
00:49:51.781 --> 00:49:54.538
<v Josh Sparkes>That reminds you,
in order to do that process,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/246-1
00:49:54.538 --> 00:49:58.819
<v Josh Sparkes>so you know as a workflow would be you
know new, you know reminds of it,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/246-2
00:49:58.819 --> 00:50:02.220
<v Josh Sparkes>it's been done,
you've checked you need to count how many</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/246-3
00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:06.912
<v Josh Sparkes>changes that are made or signed off or
what sort of details you capture as part</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/246-4
00:50:06.912 --> 00:50:07.381
<v Josh Sparkes>of that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/247-0
00:50:07.901 --> 00:50:12.401
<v Josh Sparkes>And I think we we we just put it through,
we had it in our team calendar,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/247-1
00:50:12.401 --> 00:50:17.265
<v Josh Sparkes>but I think it went through share well.
So that we could track it for the other</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/247-2
00:50:17.265 --> 00:50:20.792
<v Josh Sparkes>handling times,
the first we've been able to track that's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/247-3
00:50:20.792 --> 00:50:24.197
<v Josh Sparkes>a process like what we're doing that on a
weekly basis,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/247-4
00:50:24.197 --> 00:50:27.541
<v Josh Sparkes>but it doesn't take long to do,
you're just literally.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/248-0
00:50:27.621 --> 00:50:32.236
<v Josh Sparkes>We went into the the portal and just
looking at the report and that's in the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/248-1
00:50:32.236 --> 00:50:37.151
<v Josh Sparkes>banking portal and if there's any changes,
if we're into 3D and checking the bank</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/248-2
00:50:37.151 --> 00:50:40.207
<v Josh Sparkes>details,
updating them and then sending them on to</v>

00:50:57.954 --> 00:51:03.021
<v Josh Sparkes>the ship judge request to remind us to do
it OK and everything else is done within.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/251-0
00:51:03.461 --> 00:51:09.562

<v Josh Sparkes>ask to see that there has been changes,
can't these are names of the bank details?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/251-2
00:51:15.813 --> 00:51:18.901
<v Josh Sparkes>Can the AP manager go in and just do the?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/252-0
00:51:19.341 --> 00:51:22.645
<v Josh Sparkes>The stains check on them the final to
make sure that yes,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/252-1
00:51:22.645 --> 00:51:27.429
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm wondering if it could be an automated
request that you know coming to assign to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/252-2
00:51:27.429 --> 00:51:31.587
<v Josh Sparkes>a team member or based on your skill
matrix, whoever wants to handle it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/252-3
00:51:31.587 --> 00:51:35.061
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've got the new when it was open,
so work in progress.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/253-0
00:51:35.381 --> 00:51:40.258
<v Josh Sparkes>And then the close you've got that
handling metric always measured each week.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/253-1
00:51:40.258 --> 00:51:44.759
<v Josh Sparkes>You can have some work notes or
description you know for referencing to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/253-2
00:51:44.759 --> 00:51:48.073
<v Josh Sparkes>report upon.
You know it could be as simple as that,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/253-3
00:51:48.073 --> 00:51:50.261
<v Josh Sparkes>but you are capturing it as a task.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/254-0
00:51:50.661 --> 00:51:54.692
<v Josh Sparkes>Part of your activity or we might have
been missed or handling time,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/254-1
00:51:54.692 --> 00:51:58.897
<v Josh Sparkes>might be long for certain reason,
but it could be auto scheduled within</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/254-2
00:51:58.897 --> 00:52:01.701
<v Josh Sparkes>service now as a as a task I'll have
there's a.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/256-0
00:52:05.141 --> 00:52:08.501
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Good point. Yeah, just to check,
do you have anything about SLOS,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/256-1
00:52:08.501 --> 00:52:11.348
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's that's something that's in soon
as the first stage,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/256-2
00:52:11.348 --> 00:52:14.288
<v Josh Sparkes>just to remind me that someone is
interesting to do it and no,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/256-3
00:52:14.288 --> 00:52:17.928
<v Josh Sparkes>that might be you know if it's just a
reminder for us to go in and check just</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/256-4
00:52:17.928 --> 00:52:21.661
<v Josh Sparkes>to make sure that we've got the right
bank details before we meet the paints on</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/255-0
00:52:20.781 --> 00:52:20.901
<v Mark Sedge>Yep.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/256-5
00:52:21.661 --> 00:52:22.221
<v Josh Sparkes>the Tuesday.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/258-0
00:52:23.061 --> 00:52:28.381
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that done generally in the UK or can
anybody pick it up some teams?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/257-0
00:52:23.341 --> 00:52:23.581
<v Mark Sedge>That.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/259-0
00:52:30.261 --> 00:52:36.352
<v Josh Sparkes>That report specifically is you. Yeah,
Australia has our own separate process.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/259-1
00:52:36.352 --> 00:52:41.518
<v Josh Sparkes>So where you just go into payroll
specifically or we got automatic</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/259-2
00:52:41.518 --> 00:52:45.141
<v Josh Sparkes>automatic emails,
sorry from payroll into our.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/260-0
00:52:45.981 --> 00:52:49.707
<v Josh Sparkes>One someone's personal inbox,
so we can't send it to a team.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/260-1
00:52:49.707 --> 00:52:54.287
<v Josh Sparkes>We have to send it to an individual,
but it's triggered automatically from</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/260-2
00:52:54.287 --> 00:52:58.501
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia's payroll system,
so there's nothing that we need to do in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/260-3
00:52:58.501 --> 00:53:03.326
<v Josh Sparkes>show well for that and it's handled into
an individual for sensitivity issues.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/260-4
00:53:03.326 --> 00:53:05.341
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that how it's handled so that?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/261-0
00:53:05.421 --> 00:53:07.623
<v Josh Sparkes>Or would be out of scope for the service
now,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/261-1
00:53:07.623 --> 00:53:11.021
<v Josh Sparkes>just because of the way in which you need
to handle it? Yeah, exactly.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/262-0
00:53:18.621 --> 00:53:21.501
<v Josh Sparkes>So just the scheduled regular asking the
UK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/263-0
00:53:24.421 --> 00:53:31.107
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. I think that's very useful.
Having that managing vendor as part of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/263-1
00:53:31.107 --> 00:53:33.461
<v Josh Sparkes>the managing invoice bit.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/264-0
00:53:35.221 --> 00:53:35.341
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/265-0
00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:42.347
<v Josh Sparkes>And just carry on. Yeah. Yeah. One more.
OK to go through one if we've covered</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/265-1
00:53:42.347 --> 00:53:45.108
<v Josh Sparkes>everything for this one.
Fields on the four,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/265-2
00:53:45.108 --> 00:53:49.525
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we'll get into we might.
So we might come back to the fields on</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/265-3
00:53:49.525 --> 00:53:53.941
<v Josh Sparkes>the four as we go through the managing
voice steps. But yeah I suppose.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/266-0
00:53:54.301 --> 00:53:59.955
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just as a quick summary that you
would need a name. A legal name,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/266-1
00:53:59.955 --> 00:54:04.494
<v Josh Sparkes>also known as.
Do you capture those sorts of details for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/266-2
00:54:04.494 --> 00:54:10.545
<v Josh Sparkes>each vendor for that enrichment? Yeah.
Generally we can't accept an invoice</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/266-3
00:54:10.545 --> 00:54:11.421
<v Josh Sparkes>that's not.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/267-0
00:54:12.021 --> 00:54:17.265
<v Josh Sparkes>Like tax or that appropriate.
So it has to have the tax number has to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/267-1
00:54:17.265 --> 00:54:20.785
<v Josh Sparkes>have legal names,
it has to have bank details,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/267-2
00:54:20.785 --> 00:54:26.178
<v Josh Sparkes>whether it's about taxable or not.
So if we can invoice that's outside,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/267-3
00:54:26.178 --> 00:54:30.298
<v Josh Sparkes>that's good,
can't process it anyway reference and all</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/267-4
00:54:30.298 --> 00:54:31.421
<v Josh Sparkes>company number.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/268-0
00:54:31.661 --> 00:54:34.410
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
but they're registered on registered for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/268-1
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:38.621
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia has both something. Similarly,
these House you Australia have</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/268-2
00:54:38.621 --> 00:54:43.300
<v Josh Sparkes>equivalents in all the other countries.
So it has to be a valid tax invoice for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/268-3
00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:47.861
<v Josh Sparkes>us to be able to process if it's not a
valid tax invoice that we can't do it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/269-0
00:54:48.581 --> 00:54:48.861
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/270-0
00:54:51.381 --> 00:54:56.039
<v Josh Sparkes>Sanctions or anything you capture
regulatory or compliance issues on that,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/270-1
00:54:56.039 --> 00:54:58.461
<v Josh Sparkes>do you do any of those cheques? No. OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/271-0
00:55:00.341 --> 00:55:04.773
<v Josh Sparkes>That they've got the right to invoice in
that country, for example,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/271-1
00:55:04.773 --> 00:55:10.117
<v Josh Sparkes>but we just assume that that's the case,
that compliance has been done outside of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/271-2
00:55:10.117 --> 00:55:13.962
<v Josh Sparkes>AP. You know, yeah,
there's generally people outside of AP</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/271-3
00:55:13.962 --> 00:55:15.461
<v Josh Sparkes>that are engaging with.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/272-0
00:55:16.061 --> 00:55:21.084
<v Josh Sparkes>The merchant or the company.
So their responsibility is to make sure</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/272-1
00:55:21.084 --> 00:55:25.889
<v Josh Sparkes>that they're doing. Yeah,
that the invoice when it comes to us is</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/272-2
00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:30.621
<v Josh Sparkes>from a legitimate company.
We've got our own kind of compliance.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/273-0
00:55:30.981 --> 00:55:35.630
<v Josh Sparkes>Processes at the back end that if we
think something doesn't look right,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/273-1
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:40.471
<v Josh Sparkes>then we do our own cheques thing,
but it's not mandatory for everything and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/273-2
00:55:40.471 --> 00:55:42.381
<v Josh Sparkes>it's very few and far between.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/274-0
00:55:46.221 --> 00:55:52.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, the new supplies over ten. Yeah.
New supplies over 10,000 lbs, I think.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/275-0
00:55:53.661 --> 00:55:56.850
<v Josh Sparkes>You do the bank? Yeah,
they'll check there. Yeah, we do.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/275-1
00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:59.926
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a match. Yeah, I think. Yeah.
Can I just ask him,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/275-2
00:55:59.926 --> 00:56:02.891
<v Josh Sparkes>what's the verification approval process
over there?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/275-3
00:56:02.891 --> 00:56:06.807
<v Josh Sparkes>And is it just within the team?
Do you guys approve or do you have to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/275-4
00:56:06.807 --> 00:56:08.261
<v Josh Sparkes>formally log in an e-mail?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/276-0
00:56:08.621 --> 00:56:13.334
<v Josh Sparkes>And say, hey, after the first check,

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/276-1

<v Josh Sparkes>check or something?
It's an e-mail process so someone will go</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/276-2

<v Josh Sparkes>in,
put the details in and then ask for the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/276-3
00:56:19.995 --> 00:56:23.514
<v Josh Sparkes>AP supervisor.
Generally me at the moment to review and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/276-4
00:56:23.514 --> 00:56:26.781
<v Josh Sparkes>approve and we've got the workflows
timestamps 33A.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/277-0
00:56:27.901 --> 00:56:32.167
<v Josh Sparkes>But we capture that as part of the
workflow managing that onboarding new</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/277-1
00:56:32.167 --> 00:56:36.316
<v Josh Sparkes>vendor in ServiceNow for example,
you know that threshold bank details</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/277-2
00:56:36.316 --> 00:56:39.763
<v Josh Sparkes>check because over 10,
000 you know the value of it. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/277-3
00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:42.626
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a new vendor pay.
You put these details in,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/277-4
00:56:42.626 --> 00:56:46.541
<v Josh Sparkes>it needs authorization or go onto the
next workflow authorization.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/278-0
00:56:46.781 --> 00:56:49.300
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
Sign the group water signs and you can</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/278-1
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:54.002
<v Josh Sparkes>you can do. But I have the same question.
That's because I wanted to make sure that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/278-2
00:56:54.002 --> 00:56:57.753
<v Josh Sparkes>it's covered in that ServiceNow whole
workflow because I think so.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/278-3
00:56:57.753 --> 00:57:02.007
<v Josh Sparkes>We do it in a better form and shape right
now. OK. Yeah, that sounds great.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/278-4
00:57:02.007 --> 00:57:04.862
<v Josh Sparkes>And so you're just just jumping a few
steps ahead.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/278-5
00:57:04.862 --> 00:57:06.541
<v Josh Sparkes>And will there be a dashboard?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/279-0
00:57:06.661 --> 00:57:10.745
<v Josh Sparkes>But capturing the data like say for
example how many vendors we want to get,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/279-1
00:57:10.745 --> 00:57:13.768
<v Josh Sparkes>etcetera as well, yeah,
we can use them very powerfully.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/279-2
00:57:13.768 --> 00:57:17.162
<v Josh Sparkes>They're not such reports.
They're not the output. This is your,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/279-3
00:57:17.162 --> 00:57:19.920
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
if there was SL as breaching SL as what I</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/279-4
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.821
<v Josh Sparkes>need to do there.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/280-0
00:57:22.501 --> 00:57:25.300
<v Josh Sparkes>And that removes a lot of your
notifications.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/280-1
00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:30.166
<v Josh Sparkes>It is your first place that you open on
the day. Could be your go to, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/280-2
00:57:30.166 --> 00:57:34.425
<v Josh Sparkes>replaces your e-mail box. Essentially,
it's all there in front of you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/280-3
00:57:34.425 --> 00:57:37.101
<v Josh Sparkes>pictorially,
but you can draw down into no.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/281-0
00:57:37.341 --> 00:57:45.501
<v Josh Sparkes>Not yet. Yeah, that's very helpful,
Patrick.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/282-0
00:57:49.661 --> 00:57:54.462
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good. And I suppose as you said,
having that detail is that it's over 10,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/282-1
00:57:54.462 --> 00:57:58.019
<v Josh Sparkes>000 lbs for that bank cheque.
You can check that. You know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/282-2
00:57:58.019 --> 00:58:02.879
<v Josh Sparkes>we've reviewed it, who's done that check?
What's the details approval that can go</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/282-3
00:58:02.879 --> 00:58:05.783
<v Josh Sparkes>through that process? It's very good.
Thank you.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/282-4
00:58:05.783 --> 00:58:09.221
<v Josh Sparkes>Let me just check some processing fields
that we will do.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/283-0
00:58:09.541 --> 00:58:13.821
<v Josh Sparkes>Ann Smith's AP Team talked about some
country certificates,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/283-1
00:58:13.821 --> 00:58:18.100
<v Josh Sparkes>particularly on the backs,
reporting scheduling some of the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/283-2
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:23.948
<v Josh Sparkes>workflows and fauna under the lands with
country specifics on that manage invoice</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/283-3
00:58:23.948 --> 00:58:24.661
<v Josh Sparkes>processes.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/284-0
00:58:26.301 --> 00:58:30.084
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's good.
Other information that you need on the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/284-1
00:58:30.084 --> 00:58:34.485
<v Josh Sparkes>vendor. So for example,
I said that's a three-point whether you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/284-2
00:58:34.485 --> 00:58:38.198
<v Josh Sparkes>have any rejection processes,
you know on an invoice.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/284-3
00:58:38.198 --> 00:58:40.261
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've received an invoice.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/285-0
00:58:40.541 --> 00:58:44.400
<v Josh Sparkes>Has to be paid,
but not necessarily about the invoice now,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/285-1
00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:47.800
<v Josh Sparkes>but rejection of that vendor.
Did that ever happen?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/285-2
00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:52.901
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you ever get the vendor details are
wrong, you have to reject it based on.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/286-0
00:58:56.181 --> 00:59:01.196
<v Josh Sparkes>That generally happens through the PP
workflow of where we might not have the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/286-1
00:59:01.196 --> 00:59:06.404
<v Josh Sparkes>documentation to match bank details or
the there's information we're seeing that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/286-2
00:59:06.404 --> 00:59:09.297
<v Josh Sparkes>we can't then continue through our
workflow.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/286-3
00:59:09.297 --> 00:59:13.861
<v Josh Sparkes>So we haven't rejected sender back and
ask for additional information.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/287-0
00:59:13.941 --> 00:59:18.585
<v Josh Sparkes>All the right paperwork and check the
bank details. If we're doing it ourselves,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/287-1
00:59:18.585 --> 00:59:23.057
<v Josh Sparkes>we would be onboarding a new vendor.
If we didn't have all the information in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/287-2
00:59:23.057 --> 00:59:27.529
<v Josh Sparkes>the 1st place. So there's no way, well,
there's no point of rejection at that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/287-3
00:59:27.529 --> 00:59:30.339
<v Josh Sparkes>point.
We just wouldn't continue on the workflow</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/287-4
00:59:30.339 --> 00:59:32.861
<v Josh Sparkes>until we had all the information we
needed.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/288-0
00:59:33.741 --> 00:59:36.654
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. And we saw yesterday,
I think evening has something very</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/288-1
00:59:36.654 --> 00:59:40.473
<v Josh Sparkes>similar for their client on boarding.
They had a sort of pre checklist that was</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/288-2
00:59:40.473 --> 00:59:42.670
<v Josh Sparkes>outside of the system that they work
through.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/288-3
00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:46.537
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe that's something you may have you
have some pre checklists that you we can</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/288-4
00:59:46.537 --> 00:59:50.023
<v Josh Sparkes>use and you can take that we can
incorporate into this workflow that has</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/288-5
00:59:50.023 --> 00:59:50.261
<v Josh Sparkes>been.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/289-0
00:59:50.701 --> 00:59:53.945
<v Josh Sparkes>Signed as that,
I mean it might seem very simple that you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/289-1
00:59:53.945 --> 00:59:57.805
<v Josh Sparkes>know check name obviously don't want to
make it so labour intensive,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/289-2
00:59:57.805 --> 01:00:02.111
<v Josh Sparkes>but the fact that it's there, you know,
you can take all to go 1 by 1 or you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/289-3
01:00:02.111 --> 01:00:06.250
<v Josh Sparkes>might be that's not equivalent.
But if you've got any checklist like that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/289-4
01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:10.221
<v Josh Sparkes>that you manage outside of an Excel we
can incorporate these into the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/290-0
01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:14.470
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, we don't have a checklist,
but I think things as simple as in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/290-1
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:17.266
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia,
we have to have our Australian business</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/290-2
01:00:17.266 --> 01:00:21.433
<v Josh Sparkes>number, ABN for reporting purposes.
And so having that as an extra check to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/290-3
01:00:21.433 --> 01:00:25.381
<v Josh Sparkes>make sure that we don't forget it having
making sure that we've got it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/291-0
01:00:25.981 --> 01:00:29.684
<v Josh Sparkes>The bank details correct,
and they've been checked once, twice,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/291-1
01:00:29.684 --> 01:00:33.156
<v Josh Sparkes>a third if needed. Yeah, beautiful.
All at your fingertips.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/291-2
01:00:33.156 --> 01:00:37.843
<v Josh Sparkes>And when you sometimes do these cheques,
it's inferred that they've always done.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/291-3
01:00:37.843 --> 01:00:41.661
<v Josh Sparkes>And then I don't know whether you attach
any supporting evidence.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/293-0
01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:44.640
<v Josh Sparkes>So that we don't,
we've got the attachments, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/293-1
01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.530
<v Josh Sparkes>Otherwise the attachments as well. Yeah.
OK. That's something we can be included.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/292-0
01:00:47.461 --> 01:00:47.661
<v Mark Sedge>S.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/293-2
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:49.621
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's a process.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/294-0
01:00:49.221 --> 01:00:53.302
<v Mark Sedge>Some some of those that are critical,
you'd have as you can have as mandatory</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/294-1
01:00:53.302 --> 01:00:56.546
<v Mark Sedge>information as well.
So that you can't move through or submit</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/294-2
01:00:56.546 --> 01:00:59.999
<v Mark Sedge>the record until you've definitely got
that information in there.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/294-3
01:00:59.999 --> 01:01:02.981
<v Mark Sedge>And then that again will reduce failure
demand upstream.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/295-0
01:01:04.941 --> 01:01:08.992
<v Josh Sparkes>Think there's a file note and a call back
note or something like that as well as in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/295-1
01:01:08.992 --> 01:01:10.101
<v Josh Sparkes>evidence what we stick.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/297-0
01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:19.199
<v Josh Sparkes>It's in the UK. I've seen for the mentor.
Also, you call it a call back call.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/297-1
01:01:19.199 --> 01:01:22.461
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a call back. Yeah. Locations and.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/298-0
01:01:23.861 --> 01:01:27.448
<v Josh Sparkes>Why not? Yeah.
So if we get our friends or requests</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/298-1
01:01:27.448 --> 01:01:32.552
<v Josh Sparkes>through the workflow and in three E just
so we before we even approve it,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/298-2
01:01:32.552 --> 01:01:38.208
<v Josh Sparkes>go and check that there's not a similar
vein that in the system because sometimes</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/298-3
01:01:38.208 --> 01:01:41.381
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be classed with a different name
or.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/299-0
01:01:43.821 --> 01:01:47.166
<v Josh Sparkes>And then after,
as we bought a facility that we can</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/299-1
01:01:47.166 --> 01:01:52.184
<v Josh Sparkes>reject the vendor through the workflow.
So then it was back to the person who</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/299-2
01:01:52.184 --> 01:01:55.915
<v Josh Sparkes>needed the vendor to say there's no need
for this vendor,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/299-3
01:01:55.915 --> 01:02:00.997
<v Josh Sparkes>you can delete it because we already have
one or if they submit it through and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/299-4
01:02:00.997 --> 01:02:02.541
<v Josh Sparkes>there's no bank details.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/301-0
01:02:02.661 --> 01:02:06.700
<v Josh Sparkes>No veins or requests for anything like
that. Then we return it to them.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/301-1
01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:11.243
<v Josh Sparkes>If they put it through the workflow to
get that information before it then comes</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/301-2
01:02:11.243 --> 01:02:14.159
<v Josh Sparkes>back to us and when they are filling out
the forum.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/301-3
01:02:14.159 --> 01:02:18.141
<v Josh Sparkes>I believe that as mandatory fields that
are in three just now so that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/300-0
01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:16.141
<v Mark Sedge>So.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/303-0
01:02:18.581 --> 01:02:22.120
<v Josh Sparkes>It should be captured in that before it
comes to us.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/302-0
01:02:20.461 --> 01:02:20.941
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/303-1
01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:27.129
<v Josh Sparkes>You know who can't govern the format of
the invoice that you're receiving,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/303-2
01:02:27.129 --> 01:02:30.534
<v Josh Sparkes>presumably from your they can vary in all
formats,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/303-3
01:02:30.534 --> 01:02:34.941
<v Josh Sparkes>so you your vendors created in the set up
in three like a parent.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/304-0
01:02:35.221 --> 01:02:38.048
<v Josh Sparkes>At parent level,
is that correct rather than its</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/304-1
01:02:38.048 --> 01:02:40.874
<v Josh Sparkes>subsidiaries?
Is that how it works and you might</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/304-2
01:02:40.874 --> 01:02:44.450
<v Josh Sparkes>receive an invoice on the subsidiary
rather than the parents?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/304-3
01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:45.661
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you ever get that?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/305-0
01:02:48.301 --> 01:02:54.301
<v Josh Sparkes>I can't think of anything off front of my
head Australia wise that would be a case.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/306-0
01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:59.167
<v Mark Sedge>But this is this is again another example
of the upstream process,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/306-1
01:02:59.167 --> 01:03:03.189
<v Mark Sedge>where before someone triggers a new
vendor they should validate,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/306-2
01:03:03.189 --> 01:03:06.345
<v Mark Sedge>check that vendor doesn't already exist,
you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/306-3
01:03:06.345 --> 01:03:10.181
<v Mark Sedge>make sure they've got all of the right
information loaded in.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/309-0
01:03:10.461 --> 01:03:13.608
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
to the sort of master master system or</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/309-1
01:03:13.608 --> 01:03:18.617
<v Mark Sedge>the system of record before you know
before you guys end up having to process</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/309-2
01:03:18.617 --> 01:03:21.764
<v Mark Sedge>something,
you know which again it comes back to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/309-3
01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:25.039
<v Mark Sedge>that preventative of or preventing
failure demand.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/308-0
01:03:23.421 --> 01:03:23.581
<v Josh Sparkes>So.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/309-4
01:03:25.039 --> 01:03:26.901
<v Mark Sedge>We do need to look at how we.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/310-0
01:03:28.101 --> 01:03:32.794
<v Mark Sedge>How we're either able to,
whether there's anything we can do to fix</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/310-1
01:03:32.794 --> 01:03:38.176
<v Mark Sedge>that or how we can at least report so
that we've got fact based data of which</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/310-2
01:03:38.176 --> 01:03:43.697
<v Mark Sedge>to feed up the line to influence the
behaviours of those loading. And you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/310-3
01:03:43.697 --> 01:03:46.181
<v Mark Sedge>loading vendors into 3E for example.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/312-0
01:03:46.501 --> 01:03:46.741
<v Josh Sparkes>Play song.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/313-0
01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:48.930
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
that the probably the biggest</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/313-1
01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:53.826
<v Josh Sparkes>complication through that P to P workflow
of other people outside of AP trying to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/311-0
01:03:53.301 --> 01:03:53.861
<v Mark Sedge>Correct.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/313-2
01:03:53.826 --> 01:03:57.408
<v Josh Sparkes>onboard new vendors is that they're not
going through well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/313-3
01:03:57.408 --> 01:04:00.512
<v Josh Sparkes>They don't know what kind of cheques to
go through.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/313-4
01:04:00.512 --> 01:04:04.154
<v Josh Sparkes>If we're onboarding the vendor payees
ourselves through API,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/313-5
01:04:04.154 --> 01:04:06.661
<v Josh Sparkes>know that everyone across both teams know.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/315-0
01:04:06.781 --> 01:04:10.768
<v Josh Sparkes>Right processes to sense check to make
sure that this is a legit,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/315-1
01:04:10.768 --> 01:04:15.541
<v Josh Sparkes>legitimate new vendor payee and not just
a company. We've had it in Australia.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/315-2
01:04:15.541 --> 01:04:20.495
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a company that's changed their name
but the ABN and my details are still the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/314-0
01:04:18.861 --> 01:04:19.261
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/315-3
01:04:20.495 --> 01:04:23.394
<v Josh Sparkes>same.
So that becomes an update for us from the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/315-4
01:04:23.394 --> 01:04:24.421
<v Josh Sparkes>new vendor payee.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/318-0
01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:27.380
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
does the 3E system have any controls</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/316-0
01:04:26.101 --> 01:04:26.781
<v Josh Sparkes>What?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/318-1
01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:31.299
<v Mark Sedge>where it looks for commonality of data
like common addresses,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/318-2
01:04:31.299 --> 01:04:34.333
<v Mark Sedge>common stakeholders, common your account?
Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/318-3
01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:39.391
<v Mark Sedge>So even if the names different be if the
address and company ID and things like</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/317-0
01:04:36.061 --> 01:04:36.941
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, kind of.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/318-4
01:04:39.391 --> 01:04:42.741
<v Mark Sedge>that are common,
it flags it up to prevent the user.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/319-0
01:04:43.301 --> 01:04:44.221
<v Mark Sedge>You know, raising it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/320-0
01:04:45.061 --> 01:04:50.367
<v Josh Sparkes>It for Australia because we have our
unique identifier of the ABN field.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/320-1
01:04:50.367 --> 01:04:56.037
<v Josh Sparkes>We have a check duplicates function in
three East and that will check against</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/320-2
01:04:56.037 --> 01:05:01.851
<v Josh Sparkes>all the ABN so it will actually trigger
to say there's actually already a Peggy</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/320-3
01:05:01.851 --> 01:05:03.741
<v Josh Sparkes>in here with the same ABN.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/321-0
01:05:03.821 --> 01:05:07.868
<v Josh Sparkes>And I not have the same name,
but that's a unique identify for us.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/321-1
01:05:07.868 --> 01:05:11.189
<v Josh Sparkes>So it is very helpful that we have that
for Australia,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/321-2
01:05:11.189 --> 01:05:13.061
<v Josh Sparkes>but that's unique to Australia.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/322-0
01:05:12.061 --> 01:05:14.724
<v Mark Sedge>But in the UK there should be company
house.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/322-1
01:05:14.724 --> 01:05:19.516
<v Mark Sedge>There should be the organisation company
reference number, the same right where.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/322-2
01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:23.954
<v Mark Sedge>So if it is a if the they're loading in
information and they this the same</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/322-3
01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:27.090
<v Mark Sedge>company House reference number to that
organisation.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/322-4
01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:29.101
<v Mark Sedge>I'm assuming that's in the system.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/323-0
01:05:29.661 --> 01:05:33.518
<v Mark Sedge>That would be the same call out,
which would prevent some of that workload</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/323-1
01:05:33.518 --> 01:05:34.341
<v Mark Sedge>coming your way.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/324-0
01:05:35.701 --> 01:05:40.184
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I think they do in the year,
if someone inside AP is setting up a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/324-1
01:05:40.184 --> 01:05:42.675
<v Josh Sparkes>vendor,
I think they do have that check</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/324-2
01:05:42.675 --> 01:05:46.162
<v Josh Sparkes>duplicates function,
but it's not a hard stop for them.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/324-3
01:05:46.162 --> 01:05:50.645
<v Josh Sparkes>So they can still override it.
So it might say that there's two similar</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/324-4
01:05:50.645 --> 01:05:54.941
<v Josh Sparkes>vendors that, that, that name,
but they can still submit it through.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/325-0
01:05:55.581 --> 01:05:58.221
<v Mark Sedge>Right. OK. So, so yeah. OK, so that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/326-0
01:05:58.941 --> 01:05:59.261
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/327-0
01:06:00.621 --> 01:06:03.064
<v Mark Sedge>No,
I was just going to say that would be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/327-1
01:06:03.064 --> 01:06:07.193
<v Mark Sedge>something to whether there's we could
talk to the three E guys to say,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/327-2
01:06:07.193 --> 01:06:10.857
<v Mark Sedge>how could you, you know,
what could you do to to prevent that,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/327-3
01:06:10.857 --> 01:06:15.219
<v Mark Sedge>that being forced through such that it
means that the right rigour is done</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/327-4
01:06:15.219 --> 01:06:17.661
<v Mark Sedge>before it then causes problems downstream.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/328-0
01:06:19.101 --> 01:06:22.655
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I mean,
considering it that is through our</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/328-1
01:06:22.655 --> 01:06:27.441
<v Josh Sparkes>current P to P workflow,
I don't know if we if it's worth putting</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/328-2
01:06:27.441 --> 01:06:33.025
<v Josh Sparkes>too much effort into any changes or that
we'd make in three right now for it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/328-3
01:06:33.025 --> 01:06:38.101
<v Josh Sparkes>considering we are going to be moving and
we don't know what the new.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/330-0
01:06:38.701 --> 01:06:44.003
<v Josh Sparkes>System is going to be in terms of new
vendor pay on boarding by non AP staff.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/329-0
01:06:42.141 --> 01:06:42.381
<v Mark Sedge>Hmm.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/330-1
01:06:44.003 --> 01:06:49.440
<v Josh Sparkes>I I think probably as you said I'll get
outside of this service now but mark to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/330-2
01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:54.741
<v Josh Sparkes>your point is that on your dashboarding
you know when you get that rejection.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/331-0
01:06:55.141 --> 01:06:59.491
<v Josh Sparkes>And you've got a root cause analysis.
It could be due to three, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/331-1
01:06:59.491 --> 01:07:04.370
<v Josh Sparkes>and that and you can use that report or
it can be given to P to P as an education.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/331-2
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:07.132
<v Josh Sparkes>You know,
I think you can use that information</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/333-0
01:07:05.661 --> 01:07:08.751
<v Mark Sedge>Well, it's it's being able. Yeah.
So sorry, Deborah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/331-3
01:07:07.132 --> 01:07:07.661
<v Josh Sparkes>upstream.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/333-1
01:07:08.751 --> 01:07:12.541
<v Mark Sedge>Just jumping over you there.
The key thing is that if you've got</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/332-0
01:07:11.021 --> 01:07:11.181
<v Josh Sparkes>1.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/333-2
01:07:12.541 --> 01:07:16.505
<v Mark Sedge>workload and your team are doing
activities, you've got two things.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/333-3
01:07:16.505 --> 01:07:20.586
<v Mark Sedge>If you can't stop the activity,
you've got at least expose why you're</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/333-4
01:07:20.586 --> 01:07:24.492
<v Mark Sedge>doing it and what it costs you in terms
of time, effort, etcetera.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/333-5
01:07:24.492 --> 01:07:25.541
<v Mark Sedge>And that's that's.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/334-0
01:07:25.661 --> 01:07:30.262
<v Mark Sedge>Key message that as long as you can,
which is why when doing things via tasks</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/334-1
01:07:30.262 --> 01:07:34.922
<v Mark Sedge>in ServiceNow where you'll have a start,
the clock stop the clock so you'll be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/334-2
01:07:34.922 --> 01:07:39.346
<v Mark Sedge>able to say it took me X number of
minutes or members of the team X number</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/334-3
01:07:39.346 --> 01:07:42.531
<v Mark Sedge>of minutes to resolve that.
Because of that activity,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/334-4
01:07:42.531 --> 01:07:45.421
<v Mark Sedge>you can then do a direct calculation and
a more.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/335-0
01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:49.438
<v Mark Sedge>Indicative cost such you can go up to the
organisation.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/335-1
01:07:49.438 --> 01:07:53.957
<v Mark Sedge>Say our team is sized this way.
We operate this way because we are</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/335-2
01:07:53.957 --> 01:07:58.274
<v Mark Sedge>dealing with these things and you have
some metrics to back up.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/335-3
01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:03.603
<v Mark Sedge>What what your actual workload demand
actually is from value demand as opposed</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/335-4
01:08:03.603 --> 01:08:05.221
<v Mark Sedge>to failure demand, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/337-0
01:08:08.821 --> 01:08:09.381
<v Mark Sedge>Play song.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/336-0
01:08:09.141 --> 01:08:09.541
<v Josh Sparkes>And.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/338-0
01:08:09.981 --> 01:08:13.877
<v Mark Sedge>So just to explain that a little bit
further value demand means doing the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/338-1
01:08:13.877 --> 01:08:17.299
<v Mark Sedge>things that you need to do,
which is you know when everything is</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/338-2
01:08:17.299 --> 01:08:20.247
<v Mark Sedge>working well,
the failure demand is when you have to do</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/338-3
01:08:20.247 --> 01:08:24.563
<v Mark Sedge>work because something failed upstream,
that means that you have to do corrective</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/338-4
01:08:24.563 --> 01:08:26.985
<v Mark Sedge>action.
And if you can separate those two and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/338-5
01:08:26.985 --> 01:08:29.301
<v Mark Sedge>report against them,
it's quite a powerful.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/339-0
01:08:29.501 --> 01:08:33.182
<v Mark Sedge>To say you know to,
to influence the business broadly,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/339-1
01:08:33.182 --> 01:08:38.603
<v Mark Sedge>to make some different decisions perhaps
in terms of choices or how they operate</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/339-2
01:08:38.603 --> 01:08:43.221
<v Mark Sedge>or to, you know behaviours, measures,
incentives etcetera, etcetera.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/340-0
01:08:44.661 --> 01:08:49.548
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's an important thing for us to
keep in the back of our minds knowing</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/340-1
01:08:49.548 --> 01:08:53.335
<v Josh Sparkes>that we don't know what the new PDP
interface is going to be.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/340-2
01:08:53.335 --> 01:08:58.282
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't know what that onboarding of a
vendor pay is going to look like for us.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/340-3
01:08:58.282 --> 01:09:02.863
<v Josh Sparkes>So it could still be relevant in 12
months time when we you guys are going</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/340-4
01:09:02.863 --> 01:09:03.901
<v Josh Sparkes>through the bill.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/341-0
01:09:04.021 --> 01:09:08.225
<v Josh Sparkes>With us and we're implementing it live
with the new PP system,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/341-1
01:09:08.225 --> 01:09:11.294
<v Josh Sparkes>but I can't say whether it's relevant or
now,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/341-2
01:09:11.294 --> 01:09:16.432
<v Josh Sparkes>but if you say these are some of the
problem statements when they're looking</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/341-3
01:09:16.432 --> 01:09:19.501
<v Josh Sparkes>at that P to PPS,
that they may be addressed.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/342-0
01:09:20.261 --> 01:09:25.329
<v Josh Sparkes>During that time as well, yeah.
Can I quickly ask if there's a step</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/342-1
01:09:25.329 --> 01:09:29.428
<v Josh Sparkes>through the vendor pay on board like the
internal one,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/342-2
01:09:29.428 --> 01:09:34.421
<v Josh Sparkes>the ones that AP do ourselves that we're
looking at adding to the?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/343-0
01:09:34.901 --> 01:09:40.929
<v Josh Sparkes>New invoice workflow if there's an option
that we can also add in to say that if</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/343-1
01:09:40.929 --> 01:09:44.204
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a change of bank details,
for example,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/343-2
01:09:44.204 --> 01:09:49.264
<v Josh Sparkes>or if it's a new vendor payee with an
invoice over the value of 10,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/343-3
01:09:49.264 --> 01:09:50.901
<v Josh Sparkes>000 lbs or equivalent.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/344-0
01:09:51.581 --> 01:09:55.857
<v Josh Sparkes>That part of the checklist is someone's
putting in their file notes so that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/344-1
01:09:55.857 --> 01:09:59.569
<v Josh Sparkes>they've done their verbal dual
authentication of the bank details</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/344-2
01:09:59.569 --> 01:10:02.213
<v Josh Sparkes>correctly,
because that's part of our process.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/344-3
01:10:02.213 --> 01:10:05.645
<v Josh Sparkes>It will be good at the moment.
We just record that in three.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/344-4
01:10:05.645 --> 01:10:10.257
<v Josh Sparkes>It'd be good to be able to include that
in the workflow and the checklist through</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/344-5
01:10:10.257 --> 01:10:11.101
<v Josh Sparkes>ServiceNow too.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/345-0
01:10:11.341 --> 01:10:13.759
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's a peer reviewed or live check.
Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/345-1
01:10:13.759 --> 01:10:18.057
<v Josh Sparkes>just a couple of this yesterday that you
can have that it literally physically,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/345-2
01:10:18.057 --> 01:10:22.141
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, time stamps. Who did it?
It's checked that it's been live checked</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/345-3
01:10:22.141 --> 01:10:26.224
<v Josh Sparkes>as part of the sand processes. Yes.
I think you're also maybe talking about</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/345-4
01:10:26.224 --> 01:10:28.803
<v Josh Sparkes>what they call in service network notes
though.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/345-5
01:10:28.803 --> 01:10:31.221
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's just being able to put a quick
note.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/346-0
01:10:31.301 --> 01:10:35.757
<v Josh Sparkes>I want to say after my bed.
Then it goes for the check by the peer.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/346-1
01:10:35.757 --> 01:10:39.230
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that what you mean? Yeah.
Or is it the checklist?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/346-2
01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:42.572
<v Josh Sparkes>But it would be one of one point in the
checklist.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/346-3
01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:47.552
<v Josh Sparkes>But the ability to add a file note as
part of that to say I On this date at</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/346-4
01:10:47.552 --> 01:10:51.221
<v Josh Sparkes>this time I called this vendor.
I spoke to this person.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/347-0
01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:56.116
<v Josh Sparkes>And I verified the bank details to be
correct through an independent source so</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/347-1
01:10:56.116 --> 01:10:59.412
<v Josh Sparkes>that we can make sure that what we're
putting into 3D,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/347-2
01:10:59.412 --> 01:11:02.708
<v Josh Sparkes>any change of bank details that we get is
legit. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/347-3
01:11:02.708 --> 01:11:06.842
<v Josh Sparkes>And we could drive that through fields
rather than a note, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/347-4
01:11:06.842 --> 01:11:07.861
<v Josh Sparkes>any conversation.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/349-0
01:11:08.581 --> 01:11:12.203
<v Josh Sparkes>Confirmed. Authorised.
You've got that audit trail names and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/349-1
01:11:12.203 --> 01:11:16.479
<v Josh Sparkes>then you can report. You know,
rather than a long script you could then</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/349-2
01:11:16.479 --> 01:11:20.101
<v Josh Sparkes>start pulling out those fields, you know,
check time stamps.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/349-3
01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:23.901
<v Josh Sparkes>Who was it was they verified and then you
could report upon it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/350-0
01:11:25.141 --> 01:11:27.497
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
that would be helpful because it comes up</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/350-1
01:11:27.497 --> 01:11:29.950
<v Josh Sparkes>in our annual financial audit every year
as well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/350-2
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:33.728
<v Josh Sparkes>But we have to provide that piece of
evidence for X number of change of bank</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/350-3
01:11:33.728 --> 01:11:37.555
<v Josh Sparkes>details so that the auditors can make
sure we're going through our right work</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/350-4
01:11:37.555 --> 01:11:40.009
<v Josh Sparkes>processes.
So to be able to pull that information</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/350-5
01:11:40.009 --> 01:11:43.051
<v Josh Sparkes>out very quickly very easily would be
really helpful as well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/350-6
01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:44.621
<v Josh Sparkes>Only the back country, what was.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/351-0
01:11:45.021 --> 01:11:48.895
<v Josh Sparkes>So the time that you started your invoice
and it could be that you know there's a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/351-1
01:11:48.895 --> 01:11:52.343
<v Josh Sparkes>delay and by the time you got hold of the
vendor, there might be 3 days.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/351-2
01:11:52.343 --> 01:11:54.988
<v Josh Sparkes>You know you can. Yeah.
It's within the in service now.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/351-3
01:11:54.988 --> 01:11:58.815
<v Josh Sparkes>You're not actually physically entering
the date. It's time stamping everything.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/351-4
01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:02.735
<v Josh Sparkes>So then we've got the overall picture of
why did this take 10 days or why did this</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/351-5
01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:04.341
<v Josh Sparkes>take over to you can see actually.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/352-0
01:12:04.661 --> 01:12:09.597
<v Josh Sparkes>In order to get that vendor verification
callback is to make the process you know</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/352-1
01:12:09.597 --> 01:12:14.292
<v Josh Sparkes>and you get those insights to maybe
improve the process or you might just be,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/352-2
01:12:14.292 --> 01:12:18.866
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, an exceptional case. Yeah. Yeah,
that's good. Perfect. Thank you.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/352-3
01:12:18.866 --> 01:12:23.741
<v Josh Sparkes>And they tend to be because of the bank
details changing all the value changing.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/353-0
01:12:25.421 --> 01:12:28.436
<v Josh Sparkes>It's more common that the bank details
will change.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/353-1
01:12:28.436 --> 01:12:32.669
<v Josh Sparkes>It's only if we have a new vendor that
we've not processed before. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/353-2
01:12:32.669 --> 01:12:35.626
<v Josh Sparkes>that has an invoice over the value of 10,
000 lbs.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/353-3
01:12:35.626 --> 01:12:40.496
<v Josh Sparkes>Equivalent because obviously it's a large
amount and we want to make sure that it's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/353-4
01:12:40.496 --> 01:12:42.061
<v Josh Sparkes>again a legitimate invoice.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/354-0
01:12:43.061 --> 01:12:48.221
<v Josh Sparkes>Everything that's 9000 below regularly,
you don't don't do.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/355-0
01:12:49.981 --> 01:12:54.498
<v Josh Sparkes>My team still does just to be safe just
because we've had instances of attempted</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/355-1
01:12:54.498 --> 01:12:59.070
<v Josh Sparkes>fraud, so we would still do it anyway,
but our policy is 10,000 lbs and over, OK,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/355-2
01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:03.586
<v Josh Sparkes>because it could be from your reporting
that you see that you're getting regular</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/355-3
01:13:03.586 --> 01:13:06.374
<v Josh Sparkes>9000 or 8 that you know there's still
high value,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/355-4
01:13:06.374 --> 01:13:08.381
<v Josh Sparkes>but you've already multiple of them.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/356-0
01:13:09.301 --> 01:13:15.207
<v Josh Sparkes>It's fine. It's significant enough.
So you could have a a trigger because of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/356-1
01:13:15.207 --> 01:13:19.272
<v Josh Sparkes>the threshold,
which you could also do your workflow</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/356-2
01:13:19.272 --> 01:13:25.331
<v Josh Sparkes>request verification. Validation. Yeah,
I probably wouldn't put a value in the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/356-3
01:13:25.331 --> 01:13:26.021
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/357-0
01:13:27.461 --> 01:13:33.484
<v Josh Sparkes>Just to keep it blanket because in
Australia we probably do work for AUD 15,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/357-1
01:13:33.484 --> 01:13:38.411
<v Josh Sparkes>000 or even down to 10,
000 sometimes if we if it doesn't feel</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/357-2
01:13:38.411 --> 01:13:42.322
<v Josh Sparkes>like it.
So you you would then what you're saying</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/357-3
01:13:42.322 --> 01:13:44.981
<v Josh Sparkes>is that you would keep it for all.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/358-0
01:13:45.501 --> 01:13:49.255
<v Josh Sparkes>And then if you don't as you say as AP,
you don't feel that you need to do that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/358-1
01:13:49.255 --> 01:13:51.790
<v Josh Sparkes>verification,
you could just move on to the next step</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/358-2
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:54.277
<v Josh Sparkes>essentially,
but you've got the option for any value</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/358-3
01:13:54.277 --> 01:13:57.984
<v Josh Sparkes>to do that check just because you might
have reasons or suspicions or you just</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/358-4
01:13:57.984 --> 01:14:01.550
<v Josh Sparkes>feel that you need to check definitely.
OK well, if that makes sense. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/358-5
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:02.301
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a good one.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/359-0
01:14:04.181 --> 01:14:08.324
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry not to dwell on this,
but yesterday when we spoke with E</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/359-1
01:14:08.324 --> 01:14:13.190
<v Josh Sparkes>billing and we're talking invoices,
they mentioned we need to look at the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/359-2
01:14:13.190 --> 01:14:16.083
<v Josh Sparkes>task flow for portal subscriptions with
AP.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/359-3
01:14:16.083 --> 01:14:21.541
<v Josh Sparkes>And is that referencing the managing of
vendors here or is it a different process?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/360-0
01:14:24.421 --> 01:14:28.777
<v Josh Sparkes>Think that might fall under the invoicing
side of things? OK, yeah, we do have one.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/360-1
01:14:28.777 --> 01:14:31.837
<v Josh Sparkes>If you have the one. OK.
I just didn't want us to miss it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/360-2
01:14:31.837 --> 01:14:34.741
<v Josh Sparkes>If it was this one,
it was triggered from that process.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/361-0
01:14:36.181 --> 01:14:39.794
<v Josh Sparkes>Double check. Yeah,
we did bring up that subscription portal</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/361-1
01:14:39.794 --> 01:14:42.281
<v Josh Sparkes>fees,
but we sort of take it as a managed</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/361-2
01:14:42.281 --> 01:14:46.485
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice for that had to be paid
essentially rather than because if you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/361-3
01:14:46.485 --> 01:14:51.341
<v Josh Sparkes>categorise every one of them of paying
for rent, paying for you know you'll have.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/362-0
01:14:52.301 --> 01:14:56.105
<v Josh Sparkes>Long list that just grows. Yeah,
I think it's been handling under the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/362-1
01:14:56.105 --> 01:15:00.289
<v Josh Sparkes>managed invoice process. Yeah, it would,
because it's a subscription. Sorry.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/362-2
01:15:00.289 --> 01:15:03.821
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not a new vendor.
It's a monthly invoice that we pay. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/363-0
01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:14.498
<v Josh Sparkes>You have the information saying very
clearly that we're incorporating to the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/363-1
01:15:14.498 --> 01:15:19.628
<v Josh Sparkes>managed invoice. Yeah,
approvals we've talked about with regards</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/363-2
01:15:19.628 --> 01:15:25.941
<v Josh Sparkes>to different cheques that needs to be
made actually give me another thought so.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/364-0
01:15:27.501 --> 01:15:31.451
<v Josh Sparkes>Go back to that manage invoice and you're
at that point where you're doing the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/364-1
01:15:31.451 --> 01:15:35.501
<v Josh Sparkes>venture cheques or new onboarding of a
vendor and it by chance is rejected based</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/364-2
01:15:35.501 --> 01:15:38.701
<v Josh Sparkes>on you can have your root cause, you know,
maybe have a metric.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/364-3
01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:42.301
<v Josh Sparkes>So these are the reasons why we've
rejected it. And again, it could be.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/365-0
01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:46.526
<v Josh Sparkes>Filtered back to P2P isn't there process
that's a good insight,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/365-1
01:15:46.526 --> 01:15:50.857
<v Josh Sparkes>but there could be other reasons,
but essentially you probably need to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/365-2
01:15:50.857 --> 01:15:54.640
<v Josh Sparkes>still pay that invoice.
Presumably you've received an invoice</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/365-3
01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.690
<v Josh Sparkes>payment,
so is it rejection would be a state that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/365-4
01:15:57.690 --> 01:16:00.984
<v Josh Sparkes>you would want,
so you've rejected it and then create</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/365-5
01:16:00.984 --> 01:16:02.021
<v Josh Sparkes>another sub task.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/366-0
01:16:02.181 --> 01:16:04.709
<v Josh Sparkes>Which means that you're going to onboard
them.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/366-1
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:08.743
<v Josh Sparkes>Doesn't mean or is it more that you're
putting it on hold and you're doing</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/366-2
01:16:08.743 --> 01:16:11.756
<v Josh Sparkes>further cheques.
So in order to this invoice to be paid</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/366-3
01:16:11.756 --> 01:16:15.037
<v Josh Sparkes>because certainly don't want the
rejection to close council,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/366-4
01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:17.941
<v Josh Sparkes>the whole overall arching management of
that invoice.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/367-0
01:16:21.181 --> 01:16:24.654
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably of reflecting it.
And then there's probably another sub</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/367-1
01:16:24.654 --> 01:16:28.180
<v Josh Sparkes>task, but we've got to it now.
What's therefore we need to do the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/367-2
01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:31.279
<v Josh Sparkes>following or get further next or get
further information.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/367-3
01:16:31.279 --> 01:16:34.858
<v Josh Sparkes>I think as Lana mentioned,
the main reasons why something would be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/367-4
01:16:34.858 --> 01:16:36.781
<v Josh Sparkes>rejected is because there's already.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/368-0
01:16:37.541 --> 01:16:42.524
<v Josh Sparkes>A valid NDP is set up in the system or we
need additional information,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/368-1
01:16:42.524 --> 01:16:45.823
<v Josh Sparkes>so it's projected from AP's approval.
For now.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/368-2
01:16:45.823 --> 01:16:51.156
<v Josh Sparkes>The workflow continues until we get
everything that we need to then be able</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/368-3
01:16:51.156 --> 01:16:55.437
<v Josh Sparkes>to process the invoice.
So the the actual invoice processing</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/368-4
01:16:55.437 --> 01:16:56.981
<v Josh Sparkes>would just be on hold.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/369-0
01:16:57.061 --> 01:17:00.620
<v Josh Sparkes>Hold until we get what we need. OK?
So rather than rejection,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/369-1
01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:04.926
<v Josh Sparkes>probably was probably getting to.
It's on hold and they've got the reasons</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/369-2
01:17:04.926 --> 01:17:08.600
<v Josh Sparkes>for it as opposed to when we get one
through the working floor,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/369-3
01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:12.101
<v Josh Sparkes>there's 222 things that we can do.
We can project or return.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/370-0
01:17:12.381 --> 01:17:16.920
<v Josh Sparkes>So we normally only reject if there is a
valid vein that already set up in the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/370-1
01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:21.747
<v Josh Sparkes>system, because then I believe they can't.
Then put that back through again because</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/370-2
01:17:21.747 --> 01:17:24.620
<v Josh Sparkes>we've rejected it.
If we're returning it to them,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/370-3
01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:28.584
<v Josh Sparkes>that's basically saying, oh,
we need you to provide the bank details</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/370-4
01:17:28.584 --> 01:17:31.802
<v Josh Sparkes>or the invoice,
because sometimes we get it through and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/370-5
01:17:31.802 --> 01:17:32.261
<v Josh Sparkes>haven't.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/371-0
01:17:32.341 --> 01:17:35.847
<v Josh Sparkes>It's actually anything.
So we've got nothing to audit against.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/371-1
01:17:35.847 --> 01:17:39.465
<v Josh Sparkes>So that gets returned.
And then once they've done their actions,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/371-2
01:17:39.465 --> 01:17:43.026
<v Josh Sparkes>then they put it back there again.
So there has to or approval,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/371-3
01:17:43.026 --> 01:17:47.256
<v Josh Sparkes>but they don't be send it through to us.
And then we then reject return and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/371-4
01:17:47.256 --> 01:17:47.701
<v Josh Sparkes>approve.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/372-0
01:17:49.061 --> 01:17:49.341
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/373-0
01:17:50.661 --> 01:17:52.597
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
I just want to make sure that in that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/373-1
01:17:52.597 --> 01:17:55.501
<v Josh Sparkes>action that it didn't stop the workflow,
but it's a continuation.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/373-2
01:17:55.501 --> 01:17:56.381
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's good.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/374-0
01:17:58.541 --> 01:18:03.898
<v Josh Sparkes>SLA is what's about a venture touch
format, so setting up,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/374-1
01:18:03.898 --> 01:18:07.621
<v Josh Sparkes>creating that new and do you have an SLA?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/375-0
01:18:09.261 --> 01:18:10.701
<v Josh Sparkes>On that notes.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/376-0
01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:17.112
<v Josh Sparkes>ASAP might have an invoice with AI.
Don't know. Probably come in.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/376-1
01:18:17.112 --> 01:18:21.513
<v Josh Sparkes>But maybe yesterday we discussed that
some invoices come in, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/376-2
01:18:21.513 --> 01:18:26.347
<v Josh Sparkes>with a due date tomorrow or yesterday,
or they've been sent late for whatever</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/376-3
01:18:26.347 --> 01:18:30.190
<v Josh Sparkes>reason. Yeah. I mean,
if an invoice needs to be processed and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/376-4
01:18:30.190 --> 01:18:32.421
<v Josh Sparkes>paid, then the vendor pay has to be.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/377-0
01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:36.161
<v Josh Sparkes>Created first,
so that's dependent on how soon the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/377-1
01:18:36.161 --> 01:18:40.206
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice is due.
Person we can't put the invoice in until</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/377-2
01:18:40.206 --> 01:18:44.749
<v Josh Sparkes>the vendor pay is created.
That's why I say as soon as possible</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/377-3
01:18:44.749 --> 01:18:50.213
<v Josh Sparkes>because by not following that step it
delays the next step of processing the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/377-4
01:18:50.213 --> 01:18:50.781
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/378-0
01:18:51.581 --> 01:18:55.548
<v Josh Sparkes>And in priority order.
I'm just not sure how many you get,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/378-1
01:18:55.548 --> 01:19:00.860
<v Josh Sparkes>but on your dashboards you could have
this activity that is then to set up due</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/378-2
01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:06.104
<v Josh Sparkes>dates ASAP and it will prioritise them.
You know when they need to be done in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/378-3
01:19:06.104 --> 01:19:09.398
<v Josh Sparkes>order.
Essentially I don't know whether you have</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/378-4
01:19:09.398 --> 01:19:10.541
<v Josh Sparkes>any VIP invoices.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/379-0
01:19:10.741 --> 01:19:14.019
<v Josh Sparkes>Needs, you know,
or certain value or clients or whether</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/379-1
01:19:14.019 --> 01:19:18.058
<v Josh Sparkes>they're prioritised as well,
but it could be particularly those that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/379-2
01:19:18.058 --> 01:19:22.857
<v Josh Sparkes>they're of urgency because of the payment
that needs to be due at a certain date.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/379-3
01:19:22.857 --> 01:19:25.842
<v Josh Sparkes>A lot of them that are going through P2P,
the app,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/379-4
01:19:25.842 --> 01:19:29.061
<v Josh Sparkes>they do chase us on to get it done right
away because.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/380-0
01:19:29.541 --> 01:19:34.071
<v Josh Sparkes>And they are waiting on the vendor being
set up so that they can raise the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/380-1
01:19:34.071 --> 01:19:38.904
<v Josh Sparkes>purchase order so they chase us for that
because if they don't have the vendor,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/380-2
01:19:38.904 --> 01:19:43.373
<v Josh Sparkes>they can't create the purchase order,
which is delaying it. And so, yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/380-3
01:19:43.373 --> 01:19:46.212
<v Josh Sparkes>and again,
if it's out with the P to P system,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/380-4
01:19:46.212 --> 01:19:47.541
<v Josh Sparkes>it's usually one that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/381-0
01:19:47.901 --> 01:19:51.965
<v Josh Sparkes>And as a new new vendor or an update to
vendor that needs to be done before the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/381-1
01:19:51.965 --> 01:19:55.825
<v Josh Sparkes>next payment or whatever. So yeah,
they generally have ASAP and you tend to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/381-2
01:19:55.825 --> 01:19:59.889
<v Josh Sparkes>take them in order. So as you get them,
you just do them rather than this is of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/381-3
01:19:59.889 --> 01:20:03.038
<v Josh Sparkes>the high priority.
They're not prioritised when you get them,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/381-4
01:20:03.038 --> 01:20:03.901
<v Josh Sparkes>they're just you.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/382-0
01:20:04.581 --> 01:20:07.121
<v Josh Sparkes>Just process them eventually.
Much of the time,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/382-1
01:20:07.121 --> 01:20:11.406
<v Josh Sparkes>I think sometimes there'll be stuff that
comes through that's flagged as urgent,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/382-2
01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:14.844
<v Josh Sparkes>or every now and then someone will reach
out to you and say, oh,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/382-3
01:20:14.844 --> 01:20:17.966
<v Josh Sparkes>I've just sent an invoice,
but I really need to pay today.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/382-4
01:20:17.966 --> 01:20:19.341
<v Josh Sparkes>And so we kind of have to.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/383-0
01:20:19.701 --> 01:20:24.121
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes we're forced to prioritise
based on someone else.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/383-1
01:20:24.121 --> 01:20:29.351
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's an ordinary workflow,
then you just go through the invoices as</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/383-2
01:20:29.351 --> 01:20:33.476
<v Josh Sparkes>they come in.
But we also don't know when an invoice is</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/383-3
01:20:33.476 --> 01:20:38.706
<v Josh Sparkes>going to need a new vendor payee,
so you don't always know how or when</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/383-4
01:20:38.706 --> 01:20:39.221
<v Josh Sparkes>you're.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/384-0
01:20:39.381 --> 01:20:44.719
<v Josh Sparkes>Going to need to prioritise that creation
of a new vendor payee so prioritisation</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/384-1
01:20:44.719 --> 01:20:50.056
<v Josh Sparkes>comes with the invoice to process rather
than the actual vendor payee creation if</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/384-2
01:20:50.056 --> 01:20:54.287
<v Josh Sparkes>that makes sense. Yes,
the due dates drives would you say I mean</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/384-3
01:20:54.287 --> 01:20:57.541
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a due dates tomorrow and you get
through it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/385-0
01:20:58.061 --> 01:21:02.417
<v Josh Sparkes>That's great with no tender,
but the fact that you've picked up a new</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/385-1
01:21:02.417 --> 01:21:07.083
<v Josh Sparkes>vendor needed to be added to also making
that deadline, for example. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/385-2
01:21:07.083 --> 01:21:10.195
<v Josh Sparkes>so we say in priority just to replay back
to you,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/385-3
01:21:10.195 --> 01:21:12.621
<v Josh Sparkes>sorry if this is you would due date is.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/386-0
01:21:13.261 --> 01:21:16.501
<v Josh Sparkes>And also be the party which you're
picking up.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/386-1
01:21:16.501 --> 01:21:22.359
<v Josh Sparkes>If that's captured the order in which you
do it in. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Or what?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/386-2
01:21:22.359 --> 01:21:26.494
<v Josh Sparkes>What type of invoice?
Because if it's in a vein invoice and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/386-3
01:21:26.494 --> 01:21:27.941
<v Josh Sparkes>things like that and.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/387-0
01:21:28.221 --> 01:21:31.381
<v Josh Sparkes>Sometimes they need that paid right away
and.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/389-0
01:21:32.861 --> 01:21:37.444
<v Josh Sparkes>To book the the venue,
they can't hold it in and so that needs</v>

01:21:55.053 --> 01:21:58.872
<v Josh Sparkes>but that's just type invoice that we have
to do maybe as part of the fields in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/390-2
01:21:58.872 --> 01:22:02.690

<v Josh Sparkes>So they're getting those.
So the man who requests on the report</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/393-3
01:22:48.695 --> 01:22:52.347
<v Josh Sparkes>doesn't need to be notified.
That's just an activity that you do</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/393-4
01:22:52.347 --> 01:22:53.021

<v Josh Sparkes>updates that will be in the incorporate
into the workflow the the update one as</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/412-2

01:26:18.187 --> 01:26:21.076
<v Josh Sparkes>You mentioned about the single ports
thing either.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/416-3
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:47.981
<v Josh Sparkes>The more proactive one is it don't put

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/417-0
01:26:50.421 --> 01:26:55.968
<v Josh Sparkes>So this is the new vendor request P2P
workflow. So that's yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/417-1

<v Josh Sparkes>So there's the two work that one from P
to P and one that they do on receiving</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/418-2

<v Josh Sparkes>And the top one is internal to account.
Yeah. OK. But again,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/419-2

It will be. You could create it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/420-0
01:27:39.021 --> 01:27:40.141
<v Josh Sparkes>There's that new.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/421-0
01:27:41.661 --> 01:27:47.949
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're creating it as part of the
task of the manage invoice workflow. OK,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/421-1
01:27:47.949 --> 01:27:52.804
<v Josh Sparkes>Yep. So it could be,
but then it's it up to configuration at</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/421-2
01:27:52.804 --> 01:27:57.181
<v Josh Sparkes>the same that manage invoice.
So you know you can get.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/422-0
01:27:58.221 --> 01:28:03.604
<v Josh Sparkes>Task bottom you can easily recreate if
you're legal to you can collect single</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/422-1
01:28:03.604 --> 01:28:08.918
<v Josh Sparkes>task without doing the other part of it.
You send the single task of of that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/422-2
01:28:08.918 --> 01:28:12.162
<v Josh Sparkes>instance,
suggesting we do that without a case</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/422-3
01:28:12.162 --> 01:28:15.268
<v Josh Sparkes>without high level,
without a whole invoice.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/422-4
01:28:15.268 --> 01:28:17.821
<v Josh Sparkes>If you're just doing the vendor part.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/423-0
01:28:18.261 --> 01:28:22.901
<v Josh Sparkes>Know that you need to do.
You can just create that separately.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/423-1
01:28:22.901 --> 01:28:26.437
<v Josh Sparkes>It sounds like it sounds like that
exceptional,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/423-2
01:28:26.437 --> 01:28:32.255
<v Josh Sparkes>but they are actually picking. Yeah, OK,
got it. But it is part of the update.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/423-3
01:28:32.255 --> 01:28:33.581
<v Josh Sparkes>And the wax thing.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/424-0
01:28:34.461 --> 01:28:38.689
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
The next one down update that is again</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/424-1
01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:43.407
<v Josh Sparkes>that you can create from the in manage
invoice.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/424-2
01:28:43.407 --> 01:28:48.421
<v Josh Sparkes>So the new and the update can come as a
result of.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/426-0
01:28:49.661 --> 01:28:53.804
<v Josh Sparkes>Invoices come in.
There might be some details in there.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/426-1
01:28:53.804 --> 01:28:59.205
<v Josh Sparkes>The banks details don't match.
Therefore you're doing a subtask on that,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/426-2
01:28:59.205 --> 01:29:05.050
<v Josh Sparkes>and that is a scheduled scheduled task.
Banks one do we get a correct case for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/426-3
01:29:05.050 --> 01:29:07.861
<v Josh Sparkes>reporting? But you think we do a case?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/427-0
01:29:08.061 --> 01:29:12.682
<v Josh Sparkes>For this one well ticket or how do you
want to call it a query maybe?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/427-1
01:29:12.682 --> 01:29:16.775
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe it comes on zone. Yeah,
it's just a reminder, isn't it?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/427-2
01:29:16.775 --> 01:29:20.141
<v Josh Sparkes>So feel like it's tidy doing a case,
I don't know.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/428-0
01:29:23.381 --> 01:29:27.155
<v Josh Sparkes>It's for them. If we've got,
what would anybody else you know, see,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/428-1
01:29:27.155 --> 01:29:30.152
<v Josh Sparkes>for example,
that might be run the report for all the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/428-2
01:29:30.152 --> 01:29:33.592
<v Josh Sparkes>joiners, movers, leavers. Yeah,
that's all it is. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/428-3
01:29:33.592 --> 01:29:37.810
<v Josh Sparkes>Or what do they what do they call back?
So they're calling that a reminder.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/428-4
01:29:37.810 --> 01:29:41.861
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, it's basically is, it's new.
It's work in progress. It's done.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/429-0
01:29:43.301 --> 01:29:49.315
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, align to ESM standard for reminder,
yes reminder yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/429-1
01:29:49.315 --> 01:29:53.801
<v Josh Sparkes>activity replacing calendar calendar
event.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/429-2
01:29:53.801 --> 01:30:02.261
<v Josh Sparkes>You know a calendar reminder replacing a
calendar reminder etcetera. OK all right.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/430-0
01:30:02.421 --> 01:30:06.771
<v Josh Sparkes>Cool. And then, yeah,
I couldn't really fill in the rest here.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/430-1
01:30:06.771 --> 01:30:09.877
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. I mean, the first thing because,
like,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/430-2
01:30:09.877 --> 01:30:15.401
<v Josh Sparkes>through us through me a little bit on the,
it's fine. Yeah. But it makes sense.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/430-3
01:30:15.401 --> 01:30:19.474
<v Josh Sparkes>Makes sense. Yeah.
Something I can do it to incorporate it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/430-4
01:30:19.474 --> 01:30:21.821
<v Josh Sparkes>into the manage things on my feet.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/431-0
01:30:23.941 --> 01:30:27.611
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah. Well, it makes sense.
It does make sense,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/431-1
01:30:27.611 --> 01:30:32.233
<v Josh Sparkes>but I just wanted to check.
They could do that practically as well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/431-2
01:30:32.233 --> 01:30:36.582
<v Josh Sparkes>Then there's any more. Yeah,
tasks and minders. It's gone. Yep.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/431-3
01:30:36.582 --> 01:30:38.621
<v Josh Sparkes>That's gone to manage invoice.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/432-0
01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:43.476
<v Josh Sparkes>Isn't it?
It's incorporated within that we've</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/432-1
01:30:43.476 --> 01:30:48.098
<v Josh Sparkes>incorporated it into the manage,
I guess so, yeah, I guess so.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/432-2
01:30:48.098 --> 01:30:53.527
<v Josh Sparkes>But you can leave it there for now.
But yeah, yeah. So we're not selling.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/432-3
01:30:53.527 --> 01:30:55.581
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/433-0
01:30:56.621 --> 01:30:59.381
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just gonna get some. Yeah, I'm in.
We should have.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/434-0
01:31:00.941 --> 01:31:01.141
<v Josh Sparkes>You.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/435-0
01:31:03.381 --> 01:31:04.461
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you think?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/436-0
01:31:06.741 --> 01:31:06.981
<v Josh Sparkes>Aye.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/438-0
01:31:08.501 --> 01:31:12.614
<v Josh Sparkes>It's all and we it's yeah.
People met online. Yeah. How are you?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/438-1
01:31:12.614 --> 01:31:17.739
<v Josh Sparkes>How are you? Get on goods. Yeah. Yeah,
this is real quick. Yeah, but it's lemon.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/438-2
01:31:17.739 --> 01:31:20.902
<v Josh Sparkes>It's it's a lot different for something
it's got.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/438-3
01:31:20.902 --> 01:31:25.141
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it the big change for something? Yeah.
And I suppose it's just.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/439-0
01:31:25.741 --> 01:31:35.758
<v Josh Sparkes>Making sure that the tasks to raise tasks
for the work isn't longer than doing all</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/439-1
01:31:35.758 --> 01:31:39.981
<v Josh Sparkes>the good systems as well processes.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/440-0
01:31:41.021 --> 01:31:50.925
<v Josh Sparkes>Manage dogs? Yeah,
got to a point where they were these last</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/440-1
01:31:50.925 --> 01:32:00.341
<v Josh Sparkes>few. That's why jobs. And so, you know,
it's still. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/441-0
01:32:00.621 --> 01:32:06.100
<v Josh Sparkes>There was one for, you know, isn't that?
But you can do because we do definitely.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/441-1
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:10.978
<v Josh Sparkes>What we definitely do challenge as far
because maybe not in this nation,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/441-2
01:32:10.978 --> 01:32:16.323
<v Josh Sparkes>that's what we that's what we're doing
essentially what we do count on how many</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/441-3
01:32:16.323 --> 01:32:18.661
<v Josh Sparkes>talk with what with me is actually.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/442-0
01:32:19.421 --> 01:32:24.252
<v Josh Sparkes>Essentially not that I'm actually
trivialising it,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/442-1
01:32:24.252 --> 01:32:30.598
<v Josh Sparkes>but you are raising a new one. Yes,
I need some to do. Yeah, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/442-2
01:32:30.598 --> 01:32:37.701
<v Josh Sparkes>Or you're cancelling it because they're
leaving. Yeah. That's the sort of.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/443-0
01:32:41.261 --> 01:32:48.661
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm sure you're not.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/444-0
01:33:11.541 --> 01:33:11.781
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/445-0
01:33:18.221 --> 01:33:23.737
<v Josh Sparkes>So if we just thought this, yeah,
this is more. Yeah. Because as you said,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/445-1
01:33:23.737 --> 01:33:28.737
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean not that I'm saying,
I mean you would hope the end user like</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/445-2
01:33:28.737 --> 01:33:32.561
<v Josh Sparkes>now we raise IT requests,
we don't go help anymore.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/445-3
01:33:32.561 --> 01:33:37.341
<v Josh Sparkes>So give us a prescription and I thought I
know Steve was saying.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/446-0
01:33:37.741 --> 01:33:41.850
<v Josh Sparkes>No, we just get other reports,
but I think somethings we might say just</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/446-1
01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:45.046
<v Josh Sparkes>we could guide it that's why what do you
want to solve?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/446-2
01:33:45.046 --> 01:33:49.440
<v Josh Sparkes>What's the probably classic finance?
Did that clean the thing up? Yes. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/446-3
01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.236
<v Josh Sparkes>But yeah,
that'd be fine if you just cover that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/446-4
01:33:52.236 --> 01:33:54.861
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably close it in. Yeah. Yeah.
Good to go.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/447-0
01:33:55.981 --> 01:34:06.804
<v Josh Sparkes>But everyone got some jokes we can share
for good. Thank you. He had some grace.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/447-1
01:34:06.804 --> 01:34:08.941
<v Josh Sparkes>Excellent gates.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/448-0
01:34:12.861 --> 01:34:19.175
<v Josh Sparkes>And I was like, oh, like,
I'm actually going in three packs.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/448-1
01:34:19.175 --> 01:34:27.352
<v Josh Sparkes>You can see it. Yeah. Yeah. 3 packs a day,
different packs, because what am I?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/448-2
01:34:27.352 --> 01:34:31.181
<v Josh Sparkes>And I was like, kids. And I was like.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/449-0
01:34:32.381 --> 01:34:40.781
<v Josh Sparkes>So this space would bring us in.
So there's some land back,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/449-1

01:43:27.341 --> 01:43:36.221
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah. Amazing. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/490-0
01:43:40.021 --> 01:43:43.756
<v Josh Sparkes>The girls hadn't seen much service now,
so just going to show a bit of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/490-1
01:43:43.756 --> 01:43:46.701
<v Josh Sparkes>functionality. No,
it's an interesting one, not useful.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/492-0
01:43:48.981 --> 01:43:53.663
<v Josh Sparkes>So the people, it's sorry. Sorry everyone.
Everyone needs a passer by that. I mean,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/492-1
01:43:53.663 --> 01:43:58.121
<v Josh Sparkes>that's why I assume that it's when the
Scottish family is having a most of like</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/492-2
01:43:58.121 --> 01:43:58.901
<v Josh Sparkes>a client pass.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/493-0
01:44:02.101 --> 01:44:07.215
<v Josh Sparkes>The only one that's reading page this
page or the spawn page any kind of page</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/493-1
01:44:07.215 --> 01:44:11.213
<v Josh Sparkes>on that looks like no, no,
not form as in like a topic page.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/493-2
01:44:11.213 --> 01:44:14.819
<v Josh Sparkes>What's the you have this level page? Yeah,
this is on.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/493-3
01:44:14.819 --> 01:44:18.621
<v Josh Sparkes>I haven't really worked on these now.
How would you even?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/494-0
01:44:19.421 --> 01:44:24.642
<v Josh Sparkes>Just trying to get rid of so much like
crap on it, you know? Yeah, I think I did.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/494-1
01:44:24.642 --> 01:44:29.482
<v Josh Sparkes>Like one of them. But like a banner.
You try to make a yeah, it's all that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/494-2
01:44:29.482 --> 01:44:33.238
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So you bought? Yeah.
You bought a banner here? Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/494-3
01:44:33.238 --> 01:44:35.021
<v Josh Sparkes>Probably one of the HR ones.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/495-0
01:44:36.061 --> 01:44:44.783
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, maybe technology is it? What's that?
My rock. Keep up my rock. Can't see it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/495-1
01:44:44.783 --> 01:44:51.997
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, yeah. Oh, at the top level. Yeah.
So you put it in technology.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/495-2
01:44:51.997 --> 01:44:54.581
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be here. Is it?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/496-0
01:44:55.941 --> 01:45:02.461
<v Josh Sparkes>The marathon and before I missed by two
weeks. OK, so I was thinking to that game,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/496-1
01:45:02.461 --> 01:45:07.567
<v Josh Sparkes>shrunk them down. Yeah. I mean,
it looks better than my finance.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/496-2
01:45:07.567 --> 01:45:11.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Looks better than my finance one,
didn't it?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/497-0
01:45:11.861 --> 01:45:13.757
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
what if it was said it was just the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/497-1
01:45:13.757 --> 01:45:16.150
<v Josh Sparkes>adding a prey inside a patient with a
feather? Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/497-2
01:45:16.150 --> 01:45:19.581
<v Josh Sparkes>but you've shrunk these down as well.
Maybe hidden the descriptions. Is it?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/497-3
01:45:19.581 --> 01:45:21.523
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
but that was just basic stuff then I</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/497-4
01:45:21.523 --> 01:45:24.141
<v Josh Sparkes>didn't get any descriptions.
That's what I think. Oh, OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/498-0
01:45:26.021 --> 01:45:32.156
<v Josh Sparkes>John wants to join the second word for
you're gonna join? Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/498-1
01:45:32.156 --> 01:45:37.141
<v Josh Sparkes>It's gonna show some good stuff like that,
alright.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/499-0
01:45:41.661 --> 01:45:43.501
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I mean this works.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/500-0
01:45:47.101 --> 01:45:51.074
<v Josh Sparkes>So that I'll move that actually
automatically drives an automated</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/500-1
01:45:51.074 --> 01:45:54.205
<v Josh Sparkes>approval.
I mean it should be the other way around.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/500-2
01:45:54.205 --> 01:45:59.081
<v Josh Sparkes>But and then you can do you can select
peer reviewed and then select your review</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/500-3
01:45:59.081 --> 01:45:59.261
<v Josh Sparkes>by.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/503-0
01:46:27.621 --> 01:46:31.013
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Then you touch that. Yeah.
And it's got the amount that it's roughly</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/503-1
01:46:31.013 --> 01:46:31.781
<v Josh Sparkes>going to be what?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/504-0
01:46:37.101 --> 01:46:38.381
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So they're not.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/505-0
01:46:40.021 --> 01:46:42.221
<v Josh Sparkes>It's if we do not work,
so I say so if I got the invoice.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/506-0
01:46:50.541 --> 01:46:56.349
<v Josh Sparkes>As long as there's an charge, yeah.
Notice that matches the show.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/506-1
01:46:56.349 --> 01:46:59.341
<v Josh Sparkes>You probably with the valve, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/507-0
01:47:02.501 --> 01:47:09.299
<v Josh Sparkes>Do we get case numbers? Yeah,
either case numbers. Yeah. TBD. What the?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/507-1
01:47:09.299 --> 01:47:16.664
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Freedom number is. But yeah,
I think this is a long sequentially. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/507-2
01:47:16.664 --> 01:47:21.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Correct.
The the letters at the start is that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/508-0
01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:26.870
<v Josh Sparkes>Specific to each team, yeah,
we're going to. Well,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/508-1
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:34.733
<v Josh Sparkes>we started not not proper now, no,
we used to informal demoing this one</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/508-2
01:47:34.733 --> 01:47:36.261
<v Josh Sparkes>informal demo.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/509-0
01:47:38.541 --> 01:47:46.641
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, F5 sync,
although inconsistent because all that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/509-1
01:47:46.641 --> 01:47:54.141
<v Josh Sparkes>other ticket numbers that we put into 32
letters.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/510-0
01:47:55.061 --> 01:48:00.485
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you get us too? But isn't it?
Or have a look at them?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/510-1
01:48:00.485 --> 01:48:07.591
<v Josh Sparkes>They will be launching across work
streams is that invoices might be paying</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/510-2
01:48:07.591 --> 01:48:09.461
<v Josh Sparkes>out or paying in is.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/511-0
01:48:09.701 --> 01:48:12.656
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, even we've got managing voices.
You know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/511-1
01:48:12.656 --> 01:48:15.214
<v Josh Sparkes>it might be that you might not want to
work.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/511-2
01:48:15.214 --> 01:48:17.885
<v Josh Sparkes>Stream governs in a formatting of your
number,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/511-3
01:48:17.885 --> 01:48:20.499
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe discussed that depending on what it
is,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/511-4
01:48:20.499 --> 01:48:24.932
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not so hard coded that actually
because it seems that actually all parts</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/511-5
01:48:24.932 --> 01:48:29.421
<v Josh Sparkes>of that task or that workflow sit with
yourself. But actually it might not go.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/512-0
01:48:29.501 --> 01:48:33.172
<v Josh Sparkes>Multiple teams,
so you might take a look at that almost.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/512-1
01:48:33.172 --> 01:48:37.421
<v Josh Sparkes>There's different ways you could do it.
Could be like service up.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/513-0
01:48:39.581 --> 01:48:43.604
<v Josh Sparkes>But why don't we've a whole? OK?
Because it's how we we've got that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/513-1
01:48:43.604 --> 01:48:47.393
<v Josh Sparkes>But as we work for it,
it probably sounds a bit bit clearer now.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/513-2
01:48:47.393 --> 01:48:51.416
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yep. All right. I mean,
I think we can start to be honest with</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/513-3
01:48:51.416 --> 01:48:53.981
<v Josh Sparkes>you guys are here.
We can get back into it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/514-0
01:48:54.861 --> 01:48:54.981
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/515-0
01:48:57.141 --> 01:49:00.705
<v Josh Sparkes>Okie Dokie,
managing credit cards Deborah so you're</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/515-1
01:49:00.705 --> 01:49:05.708
<v Josh Sparkes>happy seeing ServiceNow. Yeah.
Do you want me to click through anything?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/515-2
01:49:05.708 --> 01:49:07.901
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you want to look at anything?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/516-0
01:49:11.621 --> 01:49:14.501
<v Josh Sparkes>It's in the form of the employees or
malleable.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/517-0
01:49:16.461 --> 01:49:22.099
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's more really helpful when
we get into professional cost invoices.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/517-1
01:49:22.099 --> 01:49:25.835
<v Josh Sparkes>That's probably gonna be part of
cashier's tomorrow.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/517-2
01:49:25.835 --> 01:49:31.261
<v Josh Sparkes>But the professional cost invoices is
done by accounts payable in Australia.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/518-0
01:49:33.941 --> 01:49:38.956
<v Josh Sparkes>So what we're going to what we're going
through today in terms of AP is</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/518-1
01:49:38.956 --> 01:49:42.577
<v Josh Sparkes>everything that aligns between both odds
in the UK,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/518-2
01:49:42.577 --> 01:49:47.661
<v Josh Sparkes>but there's some extra tasks that
Australia does that overlap into work.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/519-0
01:49:48.061 --> 01:49:51.270
<v Josh Sparkes>UK cashiers do change. I mean,
I've got to be in both.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/519-1
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:54.945
<v Josh Sparkes>I've covered both chains,
so I'm covering that side of things.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/519-2
01:49:54.945 --> 01:49:59.087
<v Josh Sparkes>So Mr Cashewing was a subset,
would you say sub activity of the AP not</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/519-3
01:49:59.087 --> 01:50:02.763
<v Josh Sparkes>fair to say that they also have all their
other tasks as well,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/519-4
01:50:02.763 --> 01:50:04.221
<v Josh Sparkes>but this is a particular.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/520-0
01:50:04.821 --> 01:50:10.331
<v Josh Sparkes>What is the translate particular fact
that the invoice so it's full of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/520-1
01:50:10.331 --> 01:50:15.997
<v Josh Sparkes>professional costs and they're the
invoices that they've given to us for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/520-2
01:50:15.997 --> 01:50:22.128
<v Josh Sparkes>like we engage with an external money to
specifically work on a matter a legal</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/520-3
01:50:22.128 --> 01:50:22.981
<v Josh Sparkes>matter and?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/521-0
01:50:23.381 --> 01:50:27.030
<v Josh Sparkes>We on charge those onto the clients and
we don't pay you as it was until the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/521-1
01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:27.741
<v Josh Sparkes>client gets us.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/522-0
01:50:31.981 --> 01:50:37.213
<v Josh Sparkes>That's really managed those,
but they mentioned them in cashiers,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/522-1
01:50:37.213 --> 01:50:40.701
<v Josh Sparkes>so there is going to be some stuff that
is.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/523-0
01:50:42.221 --> 01:50:47.015
<v Josh Sparkes>We can't come. I guess it's not.
I don't feel like it's going to be day</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/523-1
01:50:47.015 --> 01:50:52.341
<v Josh Sparkes>for Australia 8 P because I need to align
it best with what the UK do for their</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/523-2
01:50:52.341 --> 01:50:56.135
<v Josh Sparkes>professional costs,
but it's going to have to fall under</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/523-3
01:50:56.135 --> 01:51:01.062
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia 8. It's really weird,
it's really challenge it that Apple it is</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/523-4
01:51:01.062 --> 01:51:01.461
<v Josh Sparkes>today.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/524-0
01:51:01.981 --> 01:51:05.279
<v Josh Sparkes>Could it be aligned back rather than
celebrated? I mean,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/524-1
01:51:05.279 --> 01:51:08.983
<v Josh Sparkes>that's what that's that's probably what
we're trying to get to.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/524-2
01:51:08.983 --> 01:51:12.917
<v Josh Sparkes>That is the answer as well.
But is there an opportunity to actually</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/524-3
01:51:12.917 --> 01:51:15.810
<v Josh Sparkes>say, look,
we'll align it globally rather than it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/524-4
01:51:15.810 --> 01:51:17.141
<v Josh Sparkes>being separate service?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/525-0
01:51:23.581 --> 01:51:28.049
<v Josh Sparkes>Just she's also like some additional
tasks that they do,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/525-1
01:51:28.049 --> 01:51:34.319
<v Josh Sparkes>which means they don't have the capacity
to manage the pressure on focuses. OK,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/525-2
01:51:34.319 --> 01:51:39.021
<v Josh Sparkes>so part of how we're structured in
Australia is a bit more.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/526-0
01:51:40.661 --> 01:51:43.747
<v Josh Sparkes>About it,
I'm traditionally it can't sale in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/526-1
01:51:43.747 --> 01:51:48.204
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia in moist organisations always
deal with all invoicing.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/526-2
01:51:48.204 --> 01:51:52.044
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's kind of we've got it structured
in Australia.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/526-3
01:51:52.044 --> 01:51:56.021
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just that the nature of the legal
cashews in the UK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/527-0
01:51:57.621 --> 01:52:02.162
<v Josh Sparkes>They feel like it makes more sense for
them to also manage the professional</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/527-1
01:52:02.162 --> 01:52:05.149
<v Josh Sparkes>passes,
because then they also do other ones that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/527-2
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:09.033
<v Josh Sparkes>manage the AR function.
They manage all of the client monies and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/527-3
01:52:09.033 --> 01:52:13.872
<v Josh Sparkes>they the A is most positive installed in
terms of billing and professional cost.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/527-4
01:52:13.872 --> 01:52:16.381
<v Josh Sparkes>Invoices are going on to the Azure skills.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/528-0
01:52:17.221 --> 01:52:20.244
<v Josh Sparkes>But like I said,
it's more of a legacy set up and yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/528-1
01:52:20.244 --> 01:52:23.860
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a little bit of legacy.
It's a little bit of just traditional</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/528-2
01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:26.882
<v Josh Sparkes>Australian nuance of how Australia is
generally set up.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/528-3
01:52:26.882 --> 01:52:29.526
<v Josh Sparkes>So you'll find the whole firms are in
Australia,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/528-4
01:52:29.526 --> 01:52:32.063
<v Josh Sparkes>that AP is is set up in the same way.
So yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/528-5
01:52:32.063 --> 01:52:35.301
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just a little bit different rather
than the challenge.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/529-0
01:52:35.941 --> 01:52:37.821
<v Josh Sparkes>But in this scope they can you.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/531-0
01:52:39.501 --> 01:52:41.852
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
break that down and become more</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/531-1
01:52:41.852 --> 01:52:45.007
<v Josh Sparkes>globalised. Yeah.
I mean the invoice of the break.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/531-2
01:52:45.007 --> 01:52:48.038
<v Josh Sparkes>That's exactly the same.
Plus the issues and AP,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/531-3
01:52:48.038 --> 01:52:51.564
<v Josh Sparkes>there's only two ways to process the
professional costs.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/531-4
01:52:51.564 --> 01:52:56.141
<v Josh Sparkes>They're treated exactly the same.
So in terms of workflows and functions.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/532-0
01:52:56.821 --> 01:53:00.215
<v Josh Sparkes>We kind of line them after a manage
invoice. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/532-1
01:53:00.215 --> 01:53:04.341
<v Josh Sparkes>but you've been routed to a different
team based on location.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/533-0
01:53:05.861 --> 01:53:06.181
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, catchy.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/534-0
01:53:09.781 --> 01:53:13.718
<v Josh Sparkes>Under the accounts payable grouping for
my team in Australia. OK,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/534-1
01:53:13.718 --> 01:53:18.609
<v Josh Sparkes>so that's so the service can be aligned,
we can bring it up to that global level,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/534-2
01:53:18.609 --> 01:53:23.441
<v Josh Sparkes>but that assigned to or that matrix that
we're talking about is then segregation</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/534-3
01:53:23.441 --> 01:53:26.781
<v Josh Sparkes>of duties of who it goes to.
But actually the workflow.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/535-0
01:53:27.781 --> 01:53:31.141
<v Josh Sparkes>Can be entirely consistent. Yes. Yeah. OK,
that's good.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/535-1
01:53:31.141 --> 01:53:34.441
<v Josh Sparkes>That's why I felt like it might be better
to cover it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/535-2
01:53:34.441 --> 01:53:38.941
<v Josh Sparkes>Cashier's wise tomorrow because Mark,
Martin and I will need to create the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/535-3
01:53:38.941 --> 01:53:43.921
<v Josh Sparkes>forms because it's the forms that's going
to be the most helpful for us to get all</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/535-4
01:53:43.921 --> 01:53:46.621
<v Josh Sparkes>of the correct information that we need.
So.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/536-0
01:53:47.061 --> 01:53:52.026
<v Josh Sparkes>I need to Martin and I are going to need
to align that together. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/536-1
01:53:52.026 --> 01:53:57.411
<v Josh Sparkes>and that's been checked with some things.
The activity we have to do for the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/536-2
01:53:57.411 --> 01:54:02.445
<v Josh Sparkes>professional purposes. OK. Yeah. Perfect.
No, it doesn't. Really. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/536-3
01:54:02.445 --> 01:54:06.501
<v Josh Sparkes>Obviously forces the fact that we've come
up level again.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/538-0
01:54:06.701 --> 01:54:11.826
<v Josh Sparkes>It isn't trivialised because there's lots
of detail. It's simplified the service,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/538-1
01:54:11.826 --> 01:54:14.889
<v Josh Sparkes>so at the end I'm not paying the end of
the day.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/538-2
01:54:14.889 --> 01:54:18.326
<v Josh Sparkes>All it is is you're paying an invoice.
It's money out,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/538-3
01:54:18.326 --> 01:54:22.576
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's money out as it as it were.
Or you're paying something so.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/538-4
01:54:22.576 --> 01:54:25.701
<v Josh Sparkes>And we've tried to have it at that
service level.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/539-0
01:54:26.101 --> 01:54:30.908
<v Josh Sparkes>And the nuances and those are within the
workflow itself depending on the triggers</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/539-1
01:54:30.908 --> 01:54:34.673
<v Josh Sparkes>or the detail or the category.
And we can manage it through that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/539-2
01:54:34.673 --> 01:54:35.541
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/540-0
01:54:37.501 --> 01:54:38.381
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/541-0
01:54:40.221 --> 01:54:43.912
<v Josh Sparkes>All right.
I think we're moving on to corporate</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/541-1
01:54:43.912 --> 01:54:47.987
<v Josh Sparkes>credit cards.
We've tried to consolidate here. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/541-2
01:54:47.987 --> 01:54:53.061
<v Josh Sparkes>the corporate credit cards,
I think how many, there's 17 to 1111.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/542-0
01:54:55.861 --> 01:54:58.706
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
To take a look at all those processes,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/542-1
01:54:58.706 --> 01:55:03.952
<v Josh Sparkes>again simplified into manage output cards,
I think aligns with the tax on these or</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/542-2
01:55:03.952 --> 01:55:08.693
<v Josh Sparkes>the service catalogue you've got these
advertisement I'm taking that piece</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/542-3
01:55:08.693 --> 01:55:11.221
<v Josh Sparkes>application and then I'm realising that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/543-0
01:55:11.861 --> 01:55:23.591
<v Josh Sparkes>You do the same thing and then and then
dawned on me that of course.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/543-1
01:55:23.591 --> 01:55:26.821
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's lots of.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/544-0
01:55:27.461 --> 01:55:31.956
<v Josh Sparkes>Again,
similar workloads in terms of new work in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/544-1
01:55:31.956 --> 01:55:32.781
<v Josh Sparkes>progress.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/545-0
01:55:34.501 --> 01:55:38.255
<v Josh Sparkes>Both completely and then the pills to
invest that, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/545-1
01:55:38.255 --> 01:55:42.932
<v Josh Sparkes>credit limits that come from that.
So is that a fair enough fair assumption</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/545-2
01:55:42.932 --> 01:55:47.794
<v Josh Sparkes>that you effectively task in order to
create a new set up a corporate card for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/545-3
01:55:47.794 --> 01:55:52.594
<v Josh Sparkes>somebody and then they conclude the
recommendations that maybe those upstream</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/545-4
01:55:52.594 --> 01:55:53.701
<v Josh Sparkes>processes join us?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/546-0
01:55:54.061 --> 01:55:58.460
<v Josh Sparkes>The leaders process that trigger level.
You can get insight and report for that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/546-1
01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:01.594
<v Josh Sparkes>you creating that request for creating a
corporate card.</v>

01:56:01.594 --> 01:56:05.992
<v Josh Sparkes>I thought there's probably a good place
to start with creating a corporate card</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/546-3
01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:09.181
<v Josh Sparkes>as a new process.
Maybe you can help me through that and.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/547-0
01:56:09.501 --> 01:56:13.777
<v Josh Sparkes>Pain points.
So if there's any pain points or maybe</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/547-1
01:56:13.777 --> 01:56:18.382
<v Josh Sparkes>some localizations,
but the voice standard process that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/547-2
01:56:18.382 --> 01:56:24.468
<v Josh Sparkes>you'll follow that corporate card,
I think the main workflows that we get</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/547-3
01:56:24.468 --> 01:56:25.701
<v Josh Sparkes>into our inbox.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/548-0
01:56:26.261 --> 01:56:31.246
<v Josh Sparkes>Is for credit card applications and
queries. So when when I say queries,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/548-1
01:56:31.246 --> 01:56:36.709
<v Josh Sparkes>it's my card's been declined or I can't
remember my pin number or is when can I</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/548-2
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:41.421
<v Josh Sparkes>expect to receive my card?
Because I've gone through the application</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/548-3
01:56:41.421 --> 01:56:45.381
<v Josh Sparkes>process just any kind of ad hoc query or
troubleshooting?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/549-0
01:56:45.541 --> 01:56:50.800
<v Josh Sparkes>Issues that someone has,
everything else that's relating to credit</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/549-1
01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:53.861
<v Josh Sparkes>card management is generally done on a.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/550-0
01:56:55.501 --> 01:57:00.875
<v Josh Sparkes>It's through a report. The cancellations.
We don't always get told that someone's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/550-1
01:57:00.875 --> 01:57:04.151
<v Josh Sparkes>leaving,
but as soon as someone departs or second</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/550-2
01:57:04.151 --> 01:57:07.494
<v Josh Sparkes>to a different office,
we have to cancel the card.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/550-3
01:57:07.494 --> 01:57:12.408
<v Josh Sparkes>But that's that's just done off a report.
Yeah, we've actually come about.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/550-4
01:57:12.408 --> 01:57:13.981
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got that leavers.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/551-0
01:57:14.541 --> 01:57:18.550
<v Josh Sparkes>Effective end date I think useful,
but you know cancel it maybe the week</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/551-1
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:23.053
<v Josh Sparkes>before five times they don't have a party
because they're leading on the call for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/551-2
01:57:23.053 --> 01:57:25.909
<v Josh Sparkes>that whenever it might be.
But we've captured that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/551-3
01:57:25.909 --> 01:57:30.358
<v Josh Sparkes>You're probably getting that report from
effective end date as a card associated</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/551-4
01:57:30.358 --> 01:57:31.181
<v Josh Sparkes>so proactively.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/552-0
01:57:32.421 --> 01:57:33.701
<v Josh Sparkes>PD and pers thing.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/553-0

01:57:43.003 --> 01:57:48.925
<v Josh Sparkes>We wait. So it's part of the HR people.
And there's only the leavers.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/553-2

<v Josh Sparkes>obviously.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/554-0
01:57:55.541 --> 01:58:00.008
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, we get that into on a weekly basis.
If you can't remember what day of the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/554-1

employee Doctor Johnny. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

01:58:08.719 --> 01:58:11.678
<v Josh Sparkes>Thanks. Go ahead.
It's a separate session that we'll</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/554-4
01:58:11.678 --> 01:58:14.861
<v Josh Sparkes>probably need to revisit one person PDN
because it cuts.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/555-0
01:58:14.941 --> 01:58:20.172
<v Josh Sparkes>Across so many functions across the firm,
and so we took that as a parking lot last</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/555-1
01:58:20.172 --> 01:58:25.466
<v Josh Sparkes>week. Yeah, right. Natural sessions. Yeah,
that would be more natural for, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/555-2
01:58:25.466 --> 01:58:30.261
<v Josh Sparkes>with all that triggers, you know,
for joining natural trigger, maybe on the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/556-0
01:58:30.861 --> 01:58:35.402
<v Josh Sparkes>Skill rate or their title that you need
to collect more cards for that or set it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/556-1
01:58:35.402 --> 01:58:38.821
<v Josh Sparkes>up with that application and again with
the movers again OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/557-0
01:58:41.501 --> 01:58:44.837
<v Josh Sparkes>So in terms of new,
maybe start at the beginning of new that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/557-1
01:58:44.837 --> 01:58:48.500
<v Josh Sparkes>simple entry point, so new,
maybe they haven't just joined to take</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/557-2
01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:51.562
<v Josh Sparkes>that outside,
but you know halfway they've been there a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/557-3
01:58:51.562 --> 01:58:55.718
<v Josh Sparkes>few years they've been upgraded or
they've been promoted and we're going to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/557-4
01:58:55.718 --> 01:58:59.381
<v Josh Sparkes>have to set up a new card for them all.
There are the second ones.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/558-0
01:58:59.701 --> 01:59:05.224
<v Josh Sparkes>If you do that, post anything to it,
you set up the actual.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/558-1
01:59:05.224 --> 01:59:12.035
<v Josh Sparkes>What does that entail? Generally,
it's starts with someone emailing AP to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/558-2
01:59:12.035 --> 01:59:16.821
<v Josh Sparkes>ask for a corporate card. OK,
so moving forward in.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/559-0
01:59:17.861 --> 01:59:21.957
<v Josh Sparkes>Future while it will be that they request
it through the Vulture,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/559-1
01:59:21.957 --> 01:59:26.425
<v Josh Sparkes>so I need a new they would come in and
say I need a new corporate card,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/559-2
01:59:26.425 --> 01:59:31.327
<v Josh Sparkes>but that managed service and then they
tend to say what they're doing with it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/559-3
01:59:31.327 --> 01:59:35.237
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it particular common?
It's short term or do they tend to be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/559-4
01:59:35.237 --> 01:59:35.981
<v Josh Sparkes>once issues?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/560-0
01:59:37.541 --> 01:59:40.436
<v Josh Sparkes>When date for those those are two files
or no,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/560-1
01:59:40.436 --> 01:59:44.810
<v Josh Sparkes>there's general there's only one type of
corporate card that we issue.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/560-2
01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:48.444
<v Josh Sparkes>The request comes in saying I need a
corporate card. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/560-3
01:59:48.444 --> 01:59:53.125
<v Josh Sparkes>first thing that we need that generally
is something that AP sends back and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/560-4
01:59:53.125 --> 01:59:56.821
<v Josh Sparkes>that's across both Australia and the UK
is a business case.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/561-0
01:59:56.941 --> 02:00:00.944
<v Josh Sparkes>Template. So that's at that point.
That's when they say who they are,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/561-1
02:00:00.944 --> 02:00:03.917
<v Josh Sparkes>what their role is,
who their approving manager is,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/561-2
02:00:03.917 --> 02:00:07.862
<v Josh Sparkes>what their limit request is,
what the reason for needing a corporate</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/561-3
02:00:07.862 --> 02:00:10.378
<v Josh Sparkes>card is,
and we can't move forward with the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/561-4
02:00:10.378 --> 02:00:14.838
<v Josh Sparkes>process until we get that template that
would be part of the initial request.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/561-5
02:00:14.838 --> 02:00:15.581
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've got.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/562-0
02:00:16.701 --> 02:00:22.416
<v Josh Sparkes>I need it you send it back. They go.
So part of their request through fields</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/562-1
02:00:22.416 --> 02:00:26.424
<v Josh Sparkes>can be, you know,
mandatory credit limit towards that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/562-2
02:00:26.424 --> 02:00:32.658
<v Josh Sparkes>something that's that the credit is in it
yeah this will give us an estimated spend</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/562-3
02:00:32.658 --> 02:00:35.701
<v Josh Sparkes>per mind that they think that they might.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/563-0
02:00:35.861 --> 02:00:42.193
<v Josh Sparkes>Need the card for and we set the credit
limits from that and they don't have to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/563-1
02:00:42.193 --> 02:00:45.755
<v Josh Sparkes>give details as part of their business
case.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/563-2
02:00:45.755 --> 02:00:50.741
<v Josh Sparkes>They're detailing what they might be.
Travel hotel. Yes. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/565-0
02:00:51.541 --> 02:00:55.339
<v Josh Sparkes>Every now and then,
we'll have a business case that will come</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/565-1
02:00:55.339 --> 02:01:00.300
<v Josh Sparkes>in where the estimated spend per month
and the reason for needing corporate card</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/565-2
02:01:00.300 --> 02:01:04.955
<v Josh Sparkes>does not align. Someone asked for $20,
000 or said that they would use $20,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/565-3
02:01:04.955 --> 02:01:07.221
<v Josh Sparkes>000 a month for client entertainment.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/566-0
02:01:10.741 --> 02:01:17.421
<v Josh Sparkes>But no, that doesn't align.
So at that point we will.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/568-0
02:01:18.821 --> 02:01:24.931
<v Josh Sparkes>Use that estimated spend per month as an
outlier and just submit that business</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/568-1
02:01:24.931 --> 02:01:28.565
<v Josh Sparkes>case.
The reasoning on to the person to review</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/568-2
02:01:28.565 --> 02:01:34.056
<v Josh Sparkes>and we'll put a note to say we don't
think that 20,000 is appropriate,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/568-3
02:01:34.056 --> 02:01:38.541
<v Josh Sparkes>but we're putting forward a recommended
monthly limit of.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/569-0
02:01:38.821 --> 02:01:43.872
<v Josh Sparkes>5000 or 10,000 instead. OK.
And do you have like a matrix or any</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/569-1
02:01:43.872 --> 02:01:49.001
<v Josh Sparkes>school car or anything like that based on
so for example you pay.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/569-2
02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:53.741
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not saying maybe a partner said I
need a corporate cars.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/570-0
02:01:54.221 --> 02:01:58.767
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there a different group you say?
Actually it's just there is a for that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/570-1
02:01:58.767 --> 02:02:02.117
<v Josh Sparkes>You can grant 20,
000 whatever reason it might be for a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/570-2
02:02:02.117 --> 02:02:05.108
<v Josh Sparkes>particular client that might need to be
in place.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/570-3
02:02:05.108 --> 02:02:09.175
<v Josh Sparkes>So based on that business case and their
position and no questions,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/570-4
02:02:09.175 --> 02:02:13.661
<v Josh Sparkes>do you then pass some thresholds ready to
decline or accept based on that?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/571-0
02:02:13.741 --> 02:02:18.389
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe a rate card or whatever card you
want to call it. A matrix based on that,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/571-1
02:02:18.389 --> 02:02:21.526
<v Josh Sparkes>yes, yeah, yeah.
So partners in Australia are given a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/571-2
02:02:21.526 --> 02:02:24.431
<v Josh Sparkes>corporate card.
They don't need to go through the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/571-3
02:02:24.431 --> 02:02:27.626
<v Josh Sparkes>business case,
process the part they're on boarding or</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/571-4
02:02:27.626 --> 02:02:31.344
<v Josh Sparkes>their promotion or. Yeah.
What happens that in automatic. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/571-5
02:02:31.344 --> 02:02:33.261
<v Josh Sparkes>that probably one of the process.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/572-0
02:02:33.381 --> 02:02:36.753
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that we'll capture with you join of
those leaders,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/572-1
02:02:36.753 --> 02:02:39.937
<v Josh Sparkes>but that you wanted I think we said that
OK, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/572-2
02:02:39.937 --> 02:02:44.869
<v Josh Sparkes>So then and they have A and they have a
set limit that they're eligible for as</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/572-3
02:02:44.869 --> 02:02:45.181
<v Josh Sparkes>well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/573-0
02:02:46.621 --> 02:02:49.441
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's that's what they're not.
Trade was in the UK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/573-1
02:02:49.441 --> 02:02:51.221
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that the same similar alignments?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/574-0
02:02:52.901 --> 02:02:55.324
<v Josh Sparkes>That is,
I'm aware partners they don't need to go</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/574-1
02:02:55.324 --> 02:02:58.812
<v Josh Sparkes>through the business case if they're a
partner and if they want a card,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/574-2
02:02:58.812 --> 02:02:59.781
<v Josh Sparkes>they can get a card.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/575-0
02:03:02.741 --> 02:03:03.341
<v Josh Sparkes>Rules UK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/576-0
02:03:09.021 --> 02:03:12.687
<v Josh Sparkes>David is a director,
so I'm I've started approving all,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/576-1
02:03:12.687 --> 02:03:17.989
<v Josh Sparkes>so maybe I'll be picking it up from him
for the UK as well in the next couple of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/576-2
02:03:17.989 --> 02:03:23.159
<v Josh Sparkes>months that you'll approve. I approve.
All's right now and but I'm going to be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/576-3
02:03:23.159 --> 02:03:27.021
<v Josh Sparkes>picking it up the UK months as well, yeah.
So even though.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/577-0
02:03:27.381 --> 02:03:32.730
<v Josh Sparkes>If they want one, they'll get one.
It's still approved that it's the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/577-1
02:03:32.730 --> 02:03:37.774
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm new to this process.
Literally started on one per rule and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/577-2
02:03:37.774 --> 02:03:42.588
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a change of rules,
David and my rules and titles etcetera</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/577-3
02:03:42.588 --> 02:03:43.581
<v Josh Sparkes>recently, so.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/578-0
02:03:44.061 --> 02:03:49.840
<v Josh Sparkes>And what I do is normally I ask and ask
the Member to cross check the title,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/578-1
02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:53.668
<v Josh Sparkes>like who's,
who's at what rule and do a comparison</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/578-2
02:03:53.668 --> 02:03:58.621
<v Josh Sparkes>like the same title in the same
department or similar department.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/579-0
02:03:59.021 --> 02:04:02.131
<v Josh Sparkes>What's the limit?
Was an average what we would take it in.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/579-1
02:04:02.131 --> 02:04:06.084
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we either accept or reject it.
But we I mean now, I mean with me,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/579-2
02:04:06.084 --> 02:04:08.772
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not just accepting everything and the
partner.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/579-3
02:04:08.772 --> 02:04:11.513
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you don't work particularly the
partner ones,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/579-4
02:04:11.513 --> 02:04:15.519
<v Josh Sparkes>are you approving the partner ones? Yes,
we are approving those ones. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/579-5
02:04:15.519 --> 02:04:18.101
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah,
I'm talking about the non partner ones.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/581-0
02:04:18.381 --> 02:04:22.017
<v Josh Sparkes>Partners. Yeah,
just sort of of those that fall out of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/581-1
02:04:22.017 --> 02:04:26.181
<v Josh Sparkes>the new that if a partner wants that,
they get one with. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/581-2
02:04:26.181 --> 02:04:31.403
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's I didn't know whether in the
background says now you could have these</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/581-3
02:04:31.403 --> 02:04:36.691
<v Josh Sparkes>break up the partner non approval or yeah
yeah absolutely we need to have that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/581-4
02:04:36.691 --> 02:04:37.021
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/582-0
02:04:38.341 --> 02:04:44.461
<v Josh Sparkes>And the limits are they're probably set
and and you can you can have nature in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/582-1
02:04:44.461 --> 02:04:48.025
<v Josh Sparkes>there.
There's all the thresholds and cheques</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/582-2
02:04:48.025 --> 02:04:53.138
<v Josh Sparkes>for you. Absolutely. Yeah.
Because for example like an operations</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/582-3
02:04:53.138 --> 02:04:56.702
<v Josh Sparkes>manager,
somebody new training laws and their</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/582-4
02:04:56.702 --> 02:04:57.941
<v Josh Sparkes>limit should be.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/583-0
02:04:57.981 --> 02:05:02.315
<v Josh Sparkes>Higher because they would be organising a
lot of on site events etcetera.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/583-1
02:05:02.315 --> 02:05:06.941
<v Josh Sparkes>So understand that and why the limit is
higher than certain directive is built</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/583-2
02:05:06.941 --> 02:05:11.041
<v Josh Sparkes>and there's a little bit of the usage,
you know how how the usage is.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/583-3
02:05:11.041 --> 02:05:15.608
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's it's high heavily dependent on
the use cases and and the individual's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/583-4
02:05:15.608 --> 02:05:15.901
<v Josh Sparkes>rule.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/584-0
02:05:17.461 --> 02:05:20.570
<v Josh Sparkes>So is it on that?
Is there a core metrics that you can do</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/584-1
02:05:20.570 --> 02:05:24.161
<v Josh Sparkes>this? Otherwise no, we don't have no,
we don't have the structure,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/584-2
02:05:24.161 --> 02:05:27.216
<v Josh Sparkes>we don't have anything.
It's just like interrogation and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/584-3
02:05:27.216 --> 02:05:29.895
<v Josh Sparkes>questions.
So I want that as well and that's what</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/584-4
02:05:29.895 --> 02:05:33.861
<v Josh Sparkes>kind of but those guys so between 10 and
20 based on this role or 15 and.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/585-0
02:05:34.301 --> 02:05:39.089
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's on the K by K basis. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. For the partners who want one,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/585-1
02:05:39.089 --> 02:05:41.973
<v Josh Sparkes>they get one with a, with an approval.
I mean,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/585-2
02:05:41.973 --> 02:05:46.085
<v Josh Sparkes>sometimes it's appropriate for someone to
just have a limit of 5K.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/585-3
02:05:46.085 --> 02:05:48.786
<v Josh Sparkes>So it doesn't look to be large. Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/585-4
02:05:48.786 --> 02:05:51.916
<v Josh Sparkes>I think by the time we will kick this
process off,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/585-5
02:05:51.916 --> 02:05:53.941
<v Josh Sparkes>I think we will have this matrix.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/586-0
02:05:53.981 --> 02:06:01.030
<v Josh Sparkes>And please, I'll just take a spot of it.
So if we take that away, yes. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/586-1
02:06:01.030 --> 02:06:03.501
<v Josh Sparkes>Design that and figure out.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/587-0
02:06:08.861 --> 02:06:11.714
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so new these requested to come in through</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/587-1
02:06:11.714 --> 02:06:14.567
<v Josh Sparkes>the portal.
They can say I need to open card,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/587-2
02:06:14.567 --> 02:06:19.280
<v Josh Sparkes>they can fill in their business case,
they can set what they're going to be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/587-3
02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:22.380
<v Josh Sparkes>turning on,
entertainment through hotel etcetera.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/587-4
02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:26.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Like we checked with the standard.
I think you have travel.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/588-0
02:06:26.541 --> 02:06:32.529
<v Josh Sparkes>If you didn't tell you know in travel
costs going into department train, yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/588-1
02:06:32.529 --> 02:06:35.181
<v Josh Sparkes>frequency travel as well. Yeah. OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/589-0
02:06:37.901 --> 02:06:41.989
<v Josh Sparkes>But any of those checklists that you
would have that with Asia you know.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/589-1
02:06:41.989 --> 02:06:45.685
<v Josh Sparkes>So if it's on reports,
you say actually we didn't get this thing,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/589-2
02:06:45.685 --> 02:06:49.885
<v Josh Sparkes>we need to get that in you can capture
that all up front and it comes into</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/589-3
02:06:49.885 --> 02:06:52.573
<v Josh Sparkes>yourself.
So this is probably where decoration,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/589-4
02:06:52.573 --> 02:06:54.701
<v Josh Sparkes>although globally everyone can see it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/590-0
02:06:55.021 --> 02:06:57.752
<v Josh Sparkes>Based on the location of the person
that's requested it,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/590-1
02:06:57.752 --> 02:06:58.901
<v Josh Sparkes>it could be assigned to.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/591-0
02:07:00.261 --> 02:07:04.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Training or the UK so that that could be
the case as well? Or do you?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/591-1
02:07:04.101 --> 02:07:08.105
<v Josh Sparkes>Is it you want to go to everybody.
But the thing that you're handling it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/591-2
02:07:08.105 --> 02:07:11.397
<v Josh Sparkes>differently in the UK cause the
application corporate file.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/591-3
02:07:11.397 --> 02:07:15.730
<v Josh Sparkes>You'd have to go to the local offices
because by the time we get to submitting</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/591-4
02:07:15.730 --> 02:07:17.101
<v Josh Sparkes>the application with our.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/592-0
02:07:17.821 --> 02:07:23.675
<v Josh Sparkes>Financial providers it's very different
that process. So we can't do each other's.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/592-1
02:07:23.675 --> 02:07:29.036
<v Josh Sparkes>So finite groups. Australia and the UK,
but within those groups you'll have</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/592-2
02:07:29.036 --> 02:07:29.741
<v Josh Sparkes>localised.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/593-0
02:07:31.421 --> 02:07:34.090
<v Josh Sparkes>People that you can also find in the
matrix,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/593-1
02:07:34.090 --> 02:07:38.953
<v Josh Sparkes>we don't even know you've got the final
group, so it's for. I think there's some.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/593-2
02:07:38.953 --> 02:07:43.460
<v Josh Sparkes>So for luck that's not you that those
requests they could go to a different</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/593-3
02:07:43.460 --> 02:07:48.086
<v Josh Sparkes>person, different member of the team.
You know you can have a whole matrix of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/593-4
02:07:48.086 --> 02:07:48.501
<v Josh Sparkes>who is.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/594-0
02:07:48.781 --> 02:07:54.809
<v Josh Sparkes>Issuing those cars in your group? Yeah.
The other thing that we need to have at</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/594-1
02:07:54.809 --> 02:07:58.577
<v Josh Sparkes>the moment,
we have it as the business case comes</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/594-2
02:07:58.577 --> 02:08:01.892
<v Josh Sparkes>back to us is that approval from a
manager.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/594-3
02:08:01.892 --> 02:08:04.981
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's a way to kind of trigger. Yep.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/595-0
02:08:05.861 --> 02:08:08.853
<v Josh Sparkes>Something like an e-mail or something to
go out to,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/595-1
02:08:08.853 --> 02:08:12.248
<v Josh Sparkes>like if approving for their money for
their manager. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/595-2
02:08:12.248 --> 02:08:16.563
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can't move forward with and
corporate card application until we have</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/595-3
02:08:16.563 --> 02:08:19.439
<v Josh Sparkes>an approval from someone's manager and
say, yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/595-4
02:08:19.439 --> 02:08:22.661
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm approving them to the corporate card
at the moment.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/596-0
02:08:23.181 --> 02:08:26.569
<v Josh Sparkes>We would never,
we wouldn't send any of the applications</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/596-1
02:08:26.569 --> 02:08:29.897
<v Josh Sparkes>to send it to review until we've got that
approval, OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/596-2
02:08:29.897 --> 02:08:34.176
<v Josh Sparkes>So it makes me think and the whole
workflow. So the end to end process,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/596-3
02:08:34.176 --> 02:08:37.741
<v Josh Sparkes>can that be in the workflow.
So for example the partner or.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/597-0
02:08:38.141 --> 02:08:42.169
<v Josh Sparkes>Even behalf of the partner, you know,
initiates the application and that's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/597-1
02:08:42.169 --> 02:08:45.928
<v Josh Sparkes>there until I approve and and the
tracking of the bank and everything</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/597-2
02:08:45.928 --> 02:08:48.882
<v Josh Sparkes>because I think in the UK it is simpler,
but in A&amp;</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/597-3
02:08:48.882 --> 02:08:52.748
<v Josh Sparkes>C it's a little bit more complex in terms
of the rejections, et cetera.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/597-4
02:08:52.748 --> 02:08:56.615
<v Josh Sparkes>I think this takes more longer time.
So can that all be built into that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/597-5
02:08:56.615 --> 02:08:57.581
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow via this?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/598-0
02:08:58.061 --> 02:09:00.764
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes,
you've got the you know the the check.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/598-1
02:09:00.764 --> 02:09:05.249
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And equally,
you've raised a good point that obviously</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/598-2
02:09:05.249 --> 02:09:10.041
<v Josh Sparkes>the on behalf of the raising it can be
might raise three or four for example.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/598-3
02:09:10.041 --> 02:09:15.078
<v Josh Sparkes>And that could be part of one with less
where you're not active building laws for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/598-4
02:09:15.078 --> 02:09:16.061
<v Josh Sparkes>you can fill in.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/599-0
02:09:16.461 --> 02:09:21.923
<v Josh Sparkes>I've got 3 corporate cards I need similar
trip. I'm raising it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/599-1
02:09:21.923 --> 02:09:27.213
<v Josh Sparkes>You can do that as well.
So in in in the UK we do it for Lux.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/599-2
02:09:27.213 --> 02:09:31.821
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a new office and and more.
Of course we have.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/600-0
02:09:32.061 --> 02:09:37.301
<v Josh Sparkes>You've done one for that as well.
Recently we're moving out the US ones to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/600-1
02:09:37.301 --> 02:09:40.514
<v Josh Sparkes>UK as well. Yeah,
I just see the USI thought.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/600-2
02:09:40.514 --> 02:09:45.963
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a special place that we talk about,
but they're moving to the UK. Yes,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/600-3
02:09:45.963 --> 02:09:51.063
<v Josh Sparkes>because the the banking partner has
closed the account over there for US</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/600-4
02:09:51.063 --> 02:09:51.901
<v Josh Sparkes>offices for.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/601-0
02:09:52.101 --> 02:09:54.712
<v Josh Sparkes>Reason.
So we're gonna move the same kind of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/601-1
02:09:54.712 --> 02:09:58.076
<v Josh Sparkes>account in the UK.
So from from from an Amex perspective,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/601-2
02:09:58.076 --> 02:10:01.730
<v Josh Sparkes>we just wanna change the entity from US
to UK in their system.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/601-3
02:10:01.730 --> 02:10:05.965
<v Josh Sparkes>There is our advice they would receive
the same level of benefits of the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/601-4
02:10:05.965 --> 02:10:08.923
<v Josh Sparkes>corporate cards and it should have been
seen that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/601-5
02:10:08.923 --> 02:10:11.301
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's that's what we're trying to do.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/602-0
02:10:11.701 --> 02:10:16.024
<v Josh Sparkes>So we will manage those as well.
So I think the process we need to look is</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/602-1
02:10:16.024 --> 02:10:18.733
<v Josh Sparkes>like all these two or three locations as
well,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/602-2
02:10:18.733 --> 02:10:22.536
<v Josh Sparkes>like in terms of the checklist and all
and global and globalised.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/602-3
02:10:22.536 --> 02:10:26.801
<v Josh Sparkes>But you know you're requesting it,
you know things that standard you know</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/602-4
02:10:26.801 --> 02:10:30.605
<v Josh Sparkes>why you've got why you want it,
what you're using for those to be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/602-5
02:10:30.605 --> 02:10:31.181
<v Josh Sparkes>standards.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/603-0
02:10:31.661 --> 02:10:36.473
<v Josh Sparkes>Be probably no approval for manager
because it's being approved and then you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/603-1
02:10:36.473 --> 02:10:41.597
<v Josh Sparkes>you're inferring your approval, you know,
for those ones that can go to yourself,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/603-2
02:10:41.597 --> 02:10:45.035
<v Josh Sparkes>you can do a bulk approval that has
multiple of. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/603-3
02:10:45.035 --> 02:10:49.784
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have we're also exploring at least
in the UK, I don't know about ANC,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/603-4
02:10:49.784 --> 02:10:51.221
<v Josh Sparkes>but in AMX we are also.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/604-0
02:10:51.421 --> 02:10:55.882
<v Josh Sparkes>Excluding the option of bulk approves and
approvals etcetera as well,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/604-1
02:10:55.882 --> 02:11:00.788
<v Josh Sparkes>there is a functionality what we have
been told last couple of weeks ago and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/604-2
02:11:00.788 --> 02:11:04.802
<v Josh Sparkes>that we can do that.
So yeah actually and I just asked you one</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/604-3
02:11:04.802 --> 02:11:07.542
<v Josh Sparkes>thing.
So within the process the bank also</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/604-4
02:11:07.542 --> 02:11:09.581
<v Josh Sparkes>sometimes comes and they reject.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/605-0
02:11:10.141 --> 02:11:15.481
<v Josh Sparkes>Or they put the application on hold as
well because of their KYC criterias and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/605-1
02:11:15.481 --> 02:11:18.658
<v Josh Sparkes>all.
Now what I understand and you can correct</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/605-2
02:11:18.658 --> 02:11:22.849
<v Josh Sparkes>me is we don't, I mean sorry,
it was not the case in A&amp;Z,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/605-3
02:11:22.849 --> 02:11:28.054
<v Josh Sparkes>it was case in Morocco and we don't get
involved directly because we are not</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/605-4
02:11:28.054 --> 02:11:29.541
<v Josh Sparkes>supposed to of course.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/606-0
02:11:29.621 --> 02:11:33.207
<v Josh Sparkes>To take the personal details of the
applicant and, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/606-1
02:11:33.207 --> 02:11:38.086
<v Josh Sparkes>be the middle person to share it with the
bank as well as sometimes the bank wants</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/606-2
02:11:38.086 --> 02:11:40.673
<v Josh Sparkes>to directly speak to the applicant as
well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/606-3
02:11:40.673 --> 02:11:44.847
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that something we can try and build in
like how how will we status,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/606-4
02:11:44.847 --> 02:11:48.021
<v Josh Sparkes>how how will we track that step in the
whole process.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/607-0
02:11:48.261 --> 02:11:53.675
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So if you look at standard states,
you're not new what you've been requested,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/607-1
02:11:53.675 --> 02:11:57.027
<v Josh Sparkes>it's new,
it's awaiting approval to have seized and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/607-2
02:11:57.027 --> 02:12:00.894
<v Josh Sparkes>work in progress.
And then it might be all sent to the bank</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/607-3
02:12:00.894 --> 02:12:04.503
<v Josh Sparkes>or being processed with the state.
And as part of that,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/607-4
02:12:04.503 --> 02:12:06.501
<v Josh Sparkes>it might be reason for on hold.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/608-0
02:12:06.941 --> 02:12:09.975
<v Josh Sparkes>And you can track, you know,
personal details.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/608-1
02:12:09.975 --> 02:12:14.817
<v Josh Sparkes>It could be built into the standard
workflow if that's if that's the case.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/608-2
02:12:14.817 --> 02:12:19.400
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, are they exceptional?
Even though they're exceptionally still?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/608-3
02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:24.177
<v Josh Sparkes>Want to capture them. So I mean,
tend to be changes rather than capturing</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/608-4
02:12:24.177 --> 02:12:26.501
<v Josh Sparkes>the details. Yes, the forms will be.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/609-0
02:12:26.661 --> 02:12:30.659
<v Josh Sparkes>Submitted wires and we'll do that.
So it's actually you can absolutely</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/609-1
02:12:30.659 --> 02:12:34.656
<v Josh Sparkes>capture that. Yeah, we can do that. Yeah,
it's not. So we can do that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/609-2
02:12:34.656 --> 02:12:38.541
<v Josh Sparkes>And we can also have that surface a
wasting action from the request.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/609-3
02:12:38.541 --> 02:12:42.482
<v Josh Sparkes>So my problem is that in one of the cases,
and I mean the PE partner,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/609-4
02:12:42.482 --> 02:12:44.621
<v Josh Sparkes>they were discussing it with the bank.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/610-0
02:12:45.021 --> 02:12:49.422
<v Josh Sparkes>And things were getting delayed and we
were not even aware of that because we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/610-1
02:12:49.422 --> 02:12:53.315
<v Josh Sparkes>didn't have that visibility.
We thought of that application is there</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/610-2
02:12:53.315 --> 02:12:57.491
<v Josh Sparkes>with the bank. It's under process.
But that whole status change thing was</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/610-3
02:12:57.491 --> 02:13:00.707
<v Josh Sparkes>missing for me to track it.
And on the partnership side,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/610-4
02:13:00.707 --> 02:13:04.261
<v Josh Sparkes>they were getting annoyed at us that all
your your team's not.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/611-0
02:13:05.221 --> 02:13:09.712
<v Josh Sparkes>But then we won't be we won't be getting
involved until we know, first of all,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/611-1
02:13:09.712 --> 02:13:14.202
<v Josh Sparkes>plus we won't be able to share those data
stricted the bank because bank won't</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/611-2
02:13:14.202 --> 02:13:18.352
<v Josh Sparkes>entertain us as a middle person.
So at least if we would have known the,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/611-3
02:13:18.352 --> 02:13:23.127
<v Josh Sparkes>the the dialogue or or the status between
them too because that's external with the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/611-4
02:13:23.127 --> 02:13:23.581
<v Josh Sparkes>partner.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/612-0
02:13:24.341 --> 02:13:28.221
<v Josh Sparkes>We haven't tried to track and, you know,
improve our metrics and dashboard and see</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/612-1
02:13:28.221 --> 02:13:32.148
<v Josh Sparkes>what is there outstanding for us to chase
because it would be difficult to get into</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/612-2
02:13:32.148 --> 02:13:35.700
<v Josh Sparkes>terms of status from the bank itself.
But we can definitely put a status in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/612-3
02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:39.393
<v Josh Sparkes>where we say well actually it's a waiting
direction from I said PE or partner,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/612-4
02:13:39.393 --> 02:13:40.421
<v Josh Sparkes>whichever it might be.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/613-0
02:13:40.901 --> 02:13:44.146
<v Josh Sparkes>So that we can say actually in a
dashboard you can see actually how many</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/613-1
02:13:44.146 --> 02:13:47.168
<v Josh Sparkes>cases are still awaiting action from
employee, a partner, etcetera.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/613-2
02:13:47.168 --> 02:13:50.635
<v Josh Sparkes>If you say over three days it's been
awaiting your action and it gives you an</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/613-3
02:13:50.635 --> 02:13:53.523
<v Josh Sparkes>opportunity to go. OK.
So these are the people we need to engage</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/613-4
02:13:53.523 --> 02:13:56.501
<v Josh Sparkes>and understand where are you in that that
process, what stops you.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/614-0
02:13:57.061 --> 02:13:59.083
<v Josh Sparkes>Are you having issues with the bank,
etcetera,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/614-1
02:13:59.083 --> 02:14:02.353
<v Josh Sparkes>or if it's over five days you go OK.
It should take much quicker than this.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/614-2
02:14:02.353 --> 02:14:04.934
<v Josh Sparkes>What's happening?
So you've got that ability to get some of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/614-3
02:14:04.934 --> 02:14:07.472
<v Josh Sparkes>the information,
but you can't get all that information to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/614-4
02:14:07.472 --> 02:14:10.699
<v Josh Sparkes>you from the bank itself or angers. Yeah,
sounds fine. Yeah. In that case,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/614-5
02:14:10.699 --> 02:14:13.581
<v Josh Sparkes>probably you're unaware that those
conversations that you've been.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/615-0
02:14:14.021 --> 02:14:16.786
<v Josh Sparkes>Happening.
So you're reacting to the fact that you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/615-1
02:14:16.786 --> 02:14:21.068
<v Josh Sparkes>pull it with being processed in this way,
but actually they're having external</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/615-2
02:14:21.068 --> 02:14:25.188
<v Josh Sparkes>conversation and you're getting more.
And then and you get to know about it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/615-3
02:14:25.188 --> 02:14:27.573
<v Josh Sparkes>when there's a grievance or to be
involved,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/615-4
02:14:27.573 --> 02:14:29.741
<v Josh Sparkes>at which point you could then put it on.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/617-0
02:14:30.021 --> 02:14:33.429
<v Josh Sparkes>Hold at least you're reporting upon it,
but the reasons for it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/617-1
02:14:33.429 --> 02:14:37.156
<v Josh Sparkes>The effective date start or maybe it
started five days ago. You know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/617-2
02:14:37.156 --> 02:14:39.818
<v Josh Sparkes>for example,
but that certainly could be tracked.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/617-3
02:14:39.818 --> 02:14:43.386
<v Josh Sparkes>I think the key thing in the process is
about that time and piece.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/617-4
02:14:43.386 --> 02:14:45.941
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you know it's a way where it needs
to be.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/618-0
02:14:46.381 --> 02:14:49.890
<v Josh Sparkes>But they don't automatically tell you
what's happening with that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/618-1
02:14:49.890 --> 02:14:53.983
<v Josh Sparkes>You probably need to have it in a status
and only allow it to set that for a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/618-2
02:14:53.983 --> 02:14:57.012
<v Josh Sparkes>certain amount of time.
If that's three days, five days,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/618-3
02:14:57.012 --> 02:15:00.946
<v Josh Sparkes>whatever something that's long,
and then when it comes to the end of that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/618-4
02:15:00.946 --> 02:15:02.381
<v Josh Sparkes>five days for talking sake.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/619-0
02:15:02.661 --> 02:15:06.619
<v Josh Sparkes>That's your problem today.
Reach out to the partner and see what's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/619-1
02:15:06.619 --> 02:15:09.868
<v Josh Sparkes>happening. Are we OK? Is it continuing?
Get an update.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/619-2
02:15:09.868 --> 02:15:14.298
<v Josh Sparkes>We can capture that information.
But what we can't do is have it coming in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/619-3
02:15:14.298 --> 02:15:17.901
<v Josh Sparkes>and automatically triggering that because
it's the external.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/620-0
02:15:19.101 --> 02:15:21.341
<v Josh Sparkes>And you shouldn't be dealing directly
with the bank.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/621-0
02:15:22.941 --> 02:15:26.642
<v Josh Sparkes>And actually also turn up more that kind
of proactively reaching out to them</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/621-1
02:15:26.642 --> 02:15:30.343
<v Josh Sparkes>rather than angrily reacting to not
seeing progress being made as well as we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/621-2
02:15:30.343 --> 02:15:33.226
<v Josh Sparkes>actually we should,
we expect to need some places by now we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/621-3
02:15:33.226 --> 02:15:35.581
<v Josh Sparkes>can see it's been outstanding for six
plus days.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/622-0
02:15:36.661 --> 02:15:39.025
<v Josh Sparkes>There's something that you need to
actually need to follow up with the bank,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/622-1
02:15:39.025 --> 02:15:39.301
<v Josh Sparkes>etcetera.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/623-0
02:15:41.141 --> 02:15:43.318
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's just like a process step.
Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/623-1
02:15:43.318 --> 02:15:47.042
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it's more about changing the
practise, changing the mindset. I mean,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/623-2
02:15:47.042 --> 02:15:49.460
<v Josh Sparkes>it's more about when technically we
shouldn't be.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/623-3
02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:52.266
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's PS who should be tracking that as
well right now.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/623-4
02:15:52.266 --> 02:15:55.845
<v Josh Sparkes>That's what it might be that the P is the
question that you reach out to.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/623-5
02:15:55.845 --> 02:15:59.714
<v Josh Sparkes>So you leave at a certain amount and then
the onus is on them to do that. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/623-6
02:15:59.714 --> 02:16:00.101
<v Josh Sparkes>So yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/624-0
02:16:00.541 --> 02:16:05.039
<v Josh Sparkes>And what we might have is the requested
on behalf of, so it's done by the APA,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/624-1
02:16:05.039 --> 02:16:08.454
<v Josh Sparkes>whichever you call it.
And then they're doing it for half a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/624-2
02:16:08.454 --> 02:16:12.154
<v Josh Sparkes>partner, the etcetera.
So we can still engage with those who are</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/624-3
02:16:12.154 --> 02:16:16.595
<v Josh Sparkes>doing on behalf of rather than have to go
directly and they will also have an</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/624-4
02:16:16.595 --> 02:16:20.181
<v Josh Sparkes>option on when they raise that from their
side, they can send.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/625-0
02:16:20.541 --> 02:16:24.327
<v Josh Sparkes>Information to use. For example,
if it comes in, it's that behaviour.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/625-1
02:16:24.327 --> 02:16:28.329
<v Josh Sparkes>Change to tell them to notify you,
but also if you don't hear then you've</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/625-2
02:16:28.329 --> 02:16:31.033
<v Josh Sparkes>got the option to be able to send them a
problem.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/625-3
02:16:31.033 --> 02:16:35.251
<v Josh Sparkes>You can see we haven't heard on this,
so you do all that within the workspace</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/625-4
02:16:35.251 --> 02:16:36.981
<v Josh Sparkes>rather than sending emails back.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/626-0
02:16:37.901 --> 02:16:40.934
<v Josh Sparkes>And yeah,
SLA is between not have overall end to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/626-1
02:16:40.934 --> 02:16:43.842
<v Josh Sparkes>end.
But as you say it's been fact anticipated</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/626-2
02:16:43.842 --> 02:16:47.432
<v Josh Sparkes>5 days, six days.
You know we're all in dashboard that'll</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/626-3
02:16:47.432 --> 02:16:52.321
<v Josh Sparkes>be growing you know completely if you
expect it to be a turn around a few days</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/626-4
02:16:52.321 --> 02:16:54.301
<v Josh Sparkes>in reaching already you know so.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/627-0
02:16:55.141 --> 02:17:00.503
<v Josh Sparkes>That would be particularly helpful for
Australia because part of our process</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/627-1
02:17:00.503 --> 02:17:05.795
<v Josh Sparkes>that's different to the UK is that we
have to send our application like two</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/627-2
02:17:05.795 --> 02:17:10.181
<v Josh Sparkes>particular application forms out to the
applicant to complete.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/628-0
02:17:10.781 --> 02:17:16.061
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's what gets submitted to the
bank for us so we can send the forms out,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/628-1
02:17:16.061 --> 02:17:21.472
<v Josh Sparkes>but we might not get them back for three
months and the ticket wait at the moment</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/628-2
02:17:21.472 --> 02:17:26.488
<v Josh Sparkes>the ticket in shower which is sitting
there is pending and it might not get</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/628-3
02:17:26.488 --> 02:17:29.061
<v Josh Sparkes>followed up. So having that trigger or.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/629-0
02:17:29.861 --> 02:17:34.549
<v Josh Sparkes>Visibility for PA or TA who is assisting
to see what that tracking progress is,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/629-1
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:38.416
<v Josh Sparkes>would be really helpful.
And those applications are just thinking</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/629-2
02:17:38.416 --> 02:17:43.338
<v Josh Sparkes>about the initial request of that of that
completing your request is that something</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/629-3
02:17:43.338 --> 02:17:46.678
<v Josh Sparkes>they can attach.
So they've been given the moment of how</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/629-4
02:17:46.678 --> 02:17:47.381
<v Josh Sparkes>to complete.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/630-0
02:17:48.221 --> 02:17:52.123
<v Josh Sparkes>Applying for a corporate card,
they can complete the application form</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/630-1
02:17:52.123 --> 02:17:55.970
<v Josh Sparkes>upfront and and submit as part of the
application or as you tend to.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/630-2
02:17:55.970 --> 02:18:00.150
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a process that once you've all
applied that you're going to proceed</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/630-3
02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:04.666
<v Josh Sparkes>giving them and the business case that
you then send them the application. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/630-4
02:18:04.666 --> 02:18:07.341
<v Josh Sparkes>probably you did proactively.
That's something.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/631-0
02:18:07.581 --> 02:18:11.583
<v Josh Sparkes>And then you get that application up,
once repopulated. We. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/631-1
02:18:11.583 --> 02:18:15.887
<v Josh Sparkes>we generally do wait until the
application's been approved or rejected</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/631-2
02:18:15.887 --> 02:18:19.524
<v Josh Sparkes>so we can go back and say your
application's been approved.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/631-3
02:18:19.524 --> 02:18:22.798
<v Josh Sparkes>Here are the forms to complete.
Here's the next step.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/631-4
02:18:22.798 --> 02:18:26.981
<v Josh Sparkes>We can't move forward with or can't
progress your application until.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/632-0
02:18:27.021 --> 02:18:31.569
<v Josh Sparkes>Forms come back to us complete,
but if it's rejected then the person</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/632-1
02:18:31.569 --> 02:18:36.711
<v Josh Sparkes>hasn't completed the forms and isn't
expecting to still have the card applied</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/632-2
02:18:36.711 --> 02:18:41.918
<v Josh Sparkes>for if that makes sense and we've just
run into some trouble where we did have</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/632-3
02:18:41.918 --> 02:18:45.741
<v Josh Sparkes>the forms completed and sent to us in the
first instance.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/634-0
02:18:47.301 --> 02:18:50.128
<v Josh Sparkes>The application was success wasn't
successful.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/634-1
02:18:50.128 --> 02:18:54.698
<v Josh Sparkes>We went back to the card holder and said
no, like it's been not successful.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/634-2
02:18:54.698 --> 02:18:57.464
<v Josh Sparkes>And I said, well,
I've sent you forms anyway,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/634-3
02:18:57.464 --> 02:19:00.651
<v Josh Sparkes>so just give that, like send them off.
I don't know.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/634-4
02:19:00.651 --> 02:19:05.221
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a just a little bit of an
assumption that we would still do it, so.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/635-0
02:19:05.781 --> 02:19:09.090
<v Josh Sparkes>The fact that they complete it is an info
they will set,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/635-1
02:19:09.090 --> 02:19:13.559
<v Josh Sparkes>accept it from their behalf. Yeah,
I want to part of that form be, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/635-2
02:19:13.559 --> 02:19:18.377
<v Josh Sparkes>just to get as much detail upfront or it
doesn't take any other lengthy forms that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/635-3
02:19:18.377 --> 02:19:21.511
<v Josh Sparkes>they. No, no.
That's one page on each form that needs</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/635-4
02:19:21.511 --> 02:19:24.181
<v Josh Sparkes>to be completed.
It doesn't take a long time.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/636-0
02:19:25.861 --> 02:19:26.461
<v Josh Sparkes>And.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/637-0
02:19:27.781 --> 02:19:31.635
<v Josh Sparkes>Because it's a form to complete.
I don't know if we'd actually save any</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/637-1
02:19:31.635 --> 02:19:35.061
<v Josh Sparkes>time if we gave them upfront or if we set
them on a later date.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/637-2
02:19:35.061 --> 02:19:38.701
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just really dependent on when
someone gives us the forms back.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/638-0
02:19:41.181 --> 02:19:44.867
<v Josh Sparkes>And you can capture that.
So we're waiting for them back three or</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/638-1
02:19:44.867 --> 02:19:49.112
<v Josh Sparkes>five days and their trips coming up,
they can't expect to have a quick turn</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/638-2
02:19:49.112 --> 02:19:52.128
<v Josh Sparkes>around that.
They're leaving on a Friday and they can</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/638-3
02:19:52.128 --> 02:19:55.981
<v Josh Sparkes>think of my returns. They put some. Yeah.
OK, that's useful to know.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/639-0
02:19:56.581 --> 02:19:56.821
<v Josh Sparkes>Um.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/640-0
02:19:58.941 --> 02:20:02.387
<v Josh Sparkes>That's you've been requested.
They put in the details.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/640-1
02:20:02.387 --> 02:20:07.336
<v Josh Sparkes>You accepted object based on the business
case application that they complete.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/640-2
02:20:07.336 --> 02:20:12.034
<v Josh Sparkes>Then it goes through the process and then
you'll step in that application.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/640-3
02:20:12.034 --> 02:20:17.233
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there anything on the application that
you would get all you know been complete</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/640-4
02:20:17.233 --> 02:20:17.421
<v Josh Sparkes>or?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/641-0
02:20:17.901 --> 02:20:21.454
<v Josh Sparkes>If it's off details,
but there's a man that you feel that they</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/641-1
02:20:21.454 --> 02:20:24.837
<v Josh Sparkes>needed to complete on that. Yes.
So when we send the forms,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/641-2
02:20:24.837 --> 02:20:28.277
<v Josh Sparkes>we tell the applicant what needs to be
completed. And sorry,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/641-3
02:20:28.277 --> 02:20:32.845
<v Josh Sparkes>residential address has to be in there
rather than the office address and we are</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/641-4
02:20:32.845 --> 02:20:36.341
<v Josh Sparkes>very explicit to say residential address
has to be completed.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/642-0
02:20:37.741 --> 02:20:42.217
<v Josh Sparkes>Signature on this page and signature on
this page has to be done.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/642-1
02:20:42.217 --> 02:20:46.421
<v Josh Sparkes>The name on form A and Form B has to
match, so anything that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/643-0
02:20:48.101 --> 02:20:51.364
<v Josh Sparkes>Like that is A cause for a rejection by
the bank.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/643-1
02:20:51.364 --> 02:20:56.585
<v Josh Sparkes>We will be explicit for that card holder
to make sure it's done properly in the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/643-2
02:20:56.585 --> 02:21:00.304
<v Josh Sparkes>first instance,
and they're supporting evidence on their</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/643-3
02:21:00.304 --> 02:21:04.024
<v Josh Sparkes>identity for the of, you know,
passport driving licence.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/643-4
02:21:04.024 --> 02:21:07.221
<v Josh Sparkes>Nothing not required. OK.
Should we not do that?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/644-0
02:21:07.661 --> 02:21:10.069
<v Josh Sparkes>But the bank will. I'm going to stop,
you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/644-1
02:21:10.069 --> 02:21:14.181
<v Josh Sparkes>like some of your married name doesn't
matter. Your maiden name. That's the case.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/644-2
02:21:14.181 --> 02:21:16.689
<v Josh Sparkes>What I was dealing with.
And that's we don't get.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/644-3
02:21:16.689 --> 02:21:20.802
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't get to see anything of those,
you know, like bank will not entertain us.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/644-4
02:21:20.802 --> 02:21:23.861
<v Josh Sparkes>But then the expectation from partner is
that we sorted out.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/645-0
02:21:25.541 --> 02:21:29.337
<v Josh Sparkes>Particularly if you have a working like.
Yeah, it applies to women.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/645-1
02:21:29.337 --> 02:21:33.412
<v Josh Sparkes>You have a a working name and you have
your marriage name, you know, so,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/645-2
02:21:33.412 --> 02:21:37.543
<v Josh Sparkes>and that's good. So your working name,
you never mentioned your identity.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/645-3
02:21:37.543 --> 02:21:40.501
<v Josh Sparkes>You know that there is that discrepancy
there. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/646-0
02:21:42.061 --> 02:21:46.022
<v Josh Sparkes>And I think that's where the status is
and all will help us to go back on a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/646-1
02:21:46.022 --> 02:21:48.732
<v Josh Sparkes>schedule manner and say, well,
you know seven days,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/646-2
02:21:48.732 --> 02:21:52.901
<v Josh Sparkes>it's about 7 days and I should be taken 5
days. But what's happening, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/646-3
02:21:52.901 --> 02:21:57.070
<v Josh Sparkes>have you provided such and such details
because right now we don't even see the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/646-4
02:21:57.070 --> 02:21:58.581
<v Josh Sparkes>rejections or anything. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/647-0
02:21:59.141 --> 02:22:04.339
<v Josh Sparkes>It's truly a bank spot for us.
That kind of bank entertainment and the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/647-1
02:22:04.339 --> 02:22:08.586
<v Josh Sparkes>the bank specific for.
I'm just thinking about, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/647-2
02:22:08.586 --> 02:22:12.247
<v Josh Sparkes>the system,
they are particular application forms</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/647-3
02:22:12.247 --> 02:22:15.541
<v Josh Sparkes>from visa and it's yeah,
as long as we have.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/648-0
02:22:16.061 --> 02:22:19.805
<v Josh Sparkes>Who like PDF forms to fill in Amex does
it online,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/648-1
02:22:19.805 --> 02:22:24.063
<v Josh Sparkes>so the UK team send a link and the
applicant can fill in.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/648-2
02:22:24.063 --> 02:22:28.027
<v Josh Sparkes>They're basically filling the form online
themselves,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/648-3
02:22:28.027 --> 02:22:34.046
<v Josh Sparkes>so the personal details side of things or
the filling in the application specific</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/648-4
02:22:34.046 --> 02:22:35.661
<v Josh Sparkes>details isn't done by.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/649-0
02:22:35.901 --> 02:22:36.381
<v Josh Sparkes>OK here.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/651-0
02:22:39.741 --> 02:22:43.486
<v Mark Sedge>Last quick question,
the knowledge collateral for the do you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/651-1
02:22:43.486 --> 02:22:47.721
<v Mark Sedge>do you have at the moment any knowledge
out there for your audience,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/651-2
02:22:47.721 --> 02:22:51.220
<v Mark Sedge>you know the requesters etcetera to know
what to expect,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/651-3
02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:54.044
<v Mark Sedge>you know in terms of you know your
processes,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/651-4
02:22:54.044 --> 02:22:58.034
<v Mark Sedge>you know the key key things are going to
get asked for etcetera,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/651-5
02:22:58.034 --> 02:22:59.261
<v Mark Sedge>etcetera or is that?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/653-0
02:22:59.621 --> 02:23:02.656
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
you know something that you want to work</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/653-1
02:23:02.656 --> 02:23:06.941
<v Mark Sedge>on and put into the knowledge suite when
we when we get that available.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/655-0
02:23:08.461 --> 02:23:13.330
<v Josh Sparkes>I think this Westpac and Amex have been
used in Australia and the UK for such a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/655-1
02:23:13.330 --> 02:23:16.313
<v Josh Sparkes>long time.
This process is generally pretty well</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/655-2
02:23:16.313 --> 02:23:20.817
<v Josh Sparkes>known around the business anyway.
If someone hasn't seen the form before,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/654-0
02:23:17.861 --> 02:23:18.341
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/655-3
02:23:20.817 --> 02:23:23.616
<v Josh Sparkes>that might be new to them for the first
time,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/655-4
02:23:23.616 --> 02:23:26.781
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's just standard information being
asked for.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/656-0
02:23:27.701 --> 02:23:28.541
<v Mark Sedge>OK, cool.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/657-0
02:23:27.861 --> 02:23:32.134
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, but Mark, it's a good point.
I think nothing is documented, right.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/657-1
02:23:32.134 --> 02:23:35.177
<v Josh Sparkes>And then another,
the case is what I see right now,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/657-2
02:23:35.177 --> 02:23:39.274
<v Josh Sparkes>people are not even putting their names
properly in the right fields.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/657-3
02:23:39.274 --> 02:23:42.141
<v Josh Sparkes>So and that's partners.
So I think a guide or a.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/658-0
02:23:42.501 --> 02:23:44.541
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, that's that's where I was going,
Sonny.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/659-0
02:23:42.781 --> 02:23:47.133
<v Josh Sparkes>And you know should be there because it's
their responsibility at the end of the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/659-1
02:23:47.133 --> 02:23:51.001
<v Josh Sparkes>day, if there's any delay, you know,
we we are not creating any delays.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/659-2
02:23:51.001 --> 02:23:54.547
<v Josh Sparkes>Our job is to process a link if there's
any delay from Amex site,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/659-3
02:23:54.547 --> 02:23:58.899
<v Josh Sparkes>we have a relationship manager over there
and we pick up the call and we try and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/659-4
02:23:58.899 --> 02:24:01.101
<v Josh Sparkes>you know, expedite things. But that's it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/661-0
02:24:02.261 --> 02:24:06.640
<v Josh Sparkes>And it will be something from an ask
perspective and IT perspective that we're</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/661-1
02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:10.243
<v Josh Sparkes>building at that enterprise label from
those knowledge articles,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/661-2
02:24:10.243 --> 02:24:13.847
<v Josh Sparkes>both internal articles.
So you're prozive guidance of your sales</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/661-3
02:24:13.847 --> 02:24:16.452
<v Josh Sparkes>internally,
but also external piece and stuff.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/660-0
02:24:15.181 --> 02:24:15.381
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/661-4
02:24:16.452 --> 02:24:20.221
<v Josh Sparkes>So just something to keep in mind,
take away and think about which.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/663-0
02:24:20.261 --> 02:24:24.918
<v Josh Sparkes>If we're looking at how we initiate the
process, if you have a payment on, say,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/663-1
02:24:24.918 --> 02:24:27.713
<v Josh Sparkes>ServiceNow,
which which adds the link of MX for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/663-2
02:24:27.713 --> 02:24:30.682
<v Josh Sparkes>example,
and says this is where you have to go and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/663-3
02:24:30.682 --> 02:24:35.397
<v Josh Sparkes>then also attaches the guide or or the
minimum and things what to do, that's it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/662-0
02:24:35.021 --> 02:24:35.421
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/663-4
02:24:35.397 --> 02:24:39.821
<v Josh Sparkes>That's your formatted e-mail going
forward. You know, yeah, I think that's.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/665-0
02:24:40.061 --> 02:24:44.521
<v Josh Sparkes>Where I don't see as much of that
happening in Australia because it's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/665-1
02:24:44.521 --> 02:24:49.555
<v Josh Sparkes>manual forms and because we're emailing
the applicants directly to say this is</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/665-2
02:24:49.555 --> 02:24:53.059
<v Josh Sparkes>this information specifically,
you need to have right?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/665-3
02:24:53.059 --> 02:24:57.901
<v Josh Sparkes>Or and we have eyes over the form before
it's submitted to the bank. So if.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/666-0
02:24:58.461 --> 02:25:03.002
<v Josh Sparkes>Anything is not completed correctly if
something's not matching that we know the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/666-1
02:25:03.002 --> 02:25:06.590
<v Josh Sparkes>bank's going to reject,
we can pick it up before it gets to the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/666-2
02:25:06.590 --> 02:25:09.113
<v Josh Sparkes>bank.
So we have that advantage over the UKA</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/666-3
02:25:09.113 --> 02:25:11.804
<v Josh Sparkes>little bit.
I think it's probably to your point</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/666-4
02:25:11.804 --> 02:25:12.981
<v Josh Sparkes>though that it's the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/667-0
02:25:14.501 --> 02:25:17.335
<v Josh Sparkes>Knowledge is going to be overall,
you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/667-1
02:25:17.335 --> 02:25:21.780
<v Josh Sparkes>I want to call requirement building
against. I've done it. You know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/667-2
02:25:21.780 --> 02:25:26.160
<v Josh Sparkes>that's sort of it's done.
Can you just do it? And my habit to mark,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/667-3
02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:29.252
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
it's not a shopping cart kicking them</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/667-4
02:25:29.252 --> 02:25:32.473
<v Josh Sparkes>upfront,
but this is the five steps in order that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/667-5
02:25:32.473 --> 02:25:33.181
<v Josh Sparkes>will go to.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/668-0
02:25:33.581 --> 02:25:37.101
<v Josh Sparkes>We're starting an expectation if you or
should expect that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/669-0
02:25:39.381 --> 02:25:39.541
<v Josh Sparkes>E.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/670-0
02:25:41.461 --> 02:25:46.375
<v Josh Sparkes>We'd have a page on our finance
Australian Finance Intranet with all of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/670-1
02:25:46.375 --> 02:25:51.904
<v Josh Sparkes>the details of our Australian process,
so we did have like step one is this Step</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/670-2
02:25:51.904 --> 02:25:57.500
<v Josh Sparkes>2 is this and this is how long you would
expect to wait or how long Thunder steps</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/670-3
02:25:57.500 --> 02:26:00.981
<v Josh Sparkes>could take.
So that side of things is kind of out.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/671-0
02:26:01.101 --> 02:26:05.505
<v Josh Sparkes>They're in the business anyway,
just because from what we used to do,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/671-1
02:26:05.505 --> 02:26:08.021
<v Josh Sparkes>but to formalise would be helpful, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/672-0
02:26:08.501 --> 02:26:10.852
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
I think I think it's worth bearing in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/672-1
02:26:10.852 --> 02:26:15.020
<v Mark Sedge>mind our mission for the sort of the
broader enterprise one stop shop through</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/672-2
02:26:15.020 --> 02:26:18.760
<v Mark Sedge>employee centre and things.
I think there is there is the opportunity</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/672-3
02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:22.660
<v Mark Sedge>to perhaps visit where some of the
knowledge is and see where there's an</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/672-4
02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:23.461
<v Mark Sedge>opportunity to.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/675-0
02:26:24.421 --> 02:26:27.630
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
position some in the central central area,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/675-1
02:26:27.630 --> 02:26:30.838
<v Mark Sedge>you know,
aligned to the overall enterprise mission.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/675-2
02:26:30.838 --> 02:26:34.288
<v Mark Sedge>So that the old you know,
all of the audiences you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/675-3
02:26:34.288 --> 02:26:37.799
<v Mark Sedge>know what they're getting know,
know what the process is,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/675-4
02:26:37.799 --> 02:26:42.581
<v Mark Sedge>know what's typical across geographies,
etcetera. I think that'll be a useful.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/674-0
02:26:42.301 --> 02:26:42.461
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/676-0
02:26:43.141 --> 02:26:44.461
<v Mark Sedge>Activity to do.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/677-0
02:26:45.221 --> 02:26:48.157
<v Josh Sparkes>But like being,
it's not necessarily that you have to</v>

02:26:48.157 --> 02:26:52.668
<v Josh Sparkes>create speeds and speeds of documents if
that page is still accurate and relevant,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/677-2
02:26:52.668 --> 02:26:57.126
<v Josh Sparkes>we can link to that page from ServiceNow.
So it's just thinking that we have ways</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/677-3
02:26:57.126 --> 02:26:57.941
<v Josh Sparkes>that we can do.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/678-0
02:27:00.341 --> 02:27:03.611
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good.
So new coming in on behalf of very</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/678-1
02:27:03.611 --> 02:27:07.085
<v Josh Sparkes>houseful,
there might be multiple peers like to be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/678-2
02:27:07.085 --> 02:27:11.173
<v Josh Sparkes>multiple requests,
but typically it will be the person that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/678-3
02:27:11.173 --> 02:27:15.941
<v Josh Sparkes>requires their corporate card will be
completing their business case.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/679-0
02:27:17.621 --> 02:27:21.044
<v Josh Sparkes>You know the most it might have.
They might not within the case,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/679-1
02:27:21.044 --> 02:27:23.677
<v Josh Sparkes>might be applicable small,
so that can be copied.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/679-2
02:27:23.677 --> 02:27:26.942
<v Josh Sparkes>They don't have that. You know,
we'll give them that ability.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/679-3
02:27:26.942 --> 02:27:30.312
<v Josh Sparkes>So there's not labour intensive for them
to complete that form.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/679-4
02:27:30.312 --> 02:27:33.261
<v Josh Sparkes>And then and with you as you said then
the application.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/680-0
02:27:34.461 --> 02:27:37.762
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm sort of skipping ahead as I tell the
story. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/680-1
02:27:37.762 --> 02:27:41.124
<v Josh Sparkes>Are you clear on the data captures from
the requester?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/680-2
02:27:41.124 --> 02:27:44.059
<v Josh Sparkes>We covered that you have those. It's,
you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/680-3
02:27:44.059 --> 02:27:48.399
<v Josh Sparkes>if we could get template of that
specification nature they got so then</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/680-4
02:27:48.399 --> 02:27:49.621
<v Josh Sparkes>that'd be very good.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/681-0
02:27:50.101 --> 02:27:54.484
<v Josh Sparkes>Country specific.
We've talked about that the request</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/681-1
02:27:54.484 --> 02:28:00.652
<v Josh Sparkes>eventually is same and then it can be
applied to based on your location and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/681-2
02:28:00.652 --> 02:28:05.522
<v Josh Sparkes>then you have very.
It's still even though one's online and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/681-3
02:28:05.522 --> 02:28:09.661
<v Josh Sparkes>one paper you're still completing the
application.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/682-0
02:28:09.781 --> 02:28:15.273
<v Josh Sparkes>You know the workload state is still
completing and you could be,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/682-1
02:28:15.273 --> 02:28:21.181
<v Josh Sparkes>you know you capture that this was online
PDF. I think the online bit.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/683-0
02:28:22.981 --> 02:28:25.596
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you want?
I mean for them to provide that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/683-1
02:28:25.596 --> 02:28:28.326
<v Josh Sparkes>supporting evidence,
you need them to do that,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/683-2
02:28:28.326 --> 02:28:32.974
<v Josh Sparkes>or you're assuming that they suppose
completed that application online. I mean,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/683-3
02:28:32.974 --> 02:28:36.982
<v Josh Sparkes>once they've gone online from Ms,
they're probably a bad validation.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/683-4
02:28:36.982 --> 02:28:40.061
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know whether you need a
supporting evidence.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/684-0
02:28:40.661 --> 02:28:43.871
<v Josh Sparkes>Pray or that they've done that. No,
I mean,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/684-1
02:28:43.871 --> 02:28:49.634
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that that's how the status should
be changed to close from there. Yes.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/684-2
02:28:49.634 --> 02:28:55.033
<v Josh Sparkes>So applications. Yes. Yeah. OK.
The the third function for that that it's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/684-3
02:28:55.033 --> 02:28:57.221
<v Josh Sparkes>been application completed by.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/685-0
02:28:58.141 --> 02:29:00.581
<v Josh Sparkes>We'll find that one of them on as well,
OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/686-0
02:29:07.461 --> 02:29:08.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, thank you.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/687-0
02:29:12.581 --> 02:29:18.645
<v Josh Sparkes>And then that is then sent to your
another step sent to bank or corporate</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/687-1
02:29:18.645 --> 02:29:24.545
<v Josh Sparkes>car. And then you're waiting, I suppose,
to that point, you're waiting.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/687-2
02:29:24.545 --> 02:29:29.461
<v Josh Sparkes>Confirmation of which?
Then you get that confirmation back.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/688-0
02:29:29.901 --> 02:29:33.896
<v Josh Sparkes>As a group in Australia,
all the you think that comes back through</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/688-1
02:29:33.896 --> 02:29:37.473
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail that you get,
that's yeah or phone call or whatever.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/688-2
02:29:37.473 --> 02:29:40.096
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
we get the confirmation directly from</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/688-3
02:29:40.096 --> 02:29:44.150
<v Josh Sparkes>Westpac because we're the one where the
team's submitting it. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/688-4
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:48.621
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have all of the visibility of the
workflows between US and the bank.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/689-0
02:29:49.141 --> 02:29:50.781
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. Thank you, Ken.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/690-0
02:29:53.461 --> 02:29:53.741
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/691-0
02:29:58.941 --> 02:30:02.055
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
So I think we get the confirmation and we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/691-1
02:30:02.055 --> 02:30:06.661
<v Josh Sparkes>also get the cards and then we host the
cards down to the user, right.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/692-0
02:30:09.981 --> 02:30:10.221
<v Josh Sparkes>So.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/693-0
02:30:12.661 --> 02:30:17.517
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. So when we get the request,
then when it's approved by the business,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/693-1
02:30:17.517 --> 02:30:21.791
<v Josh Sparkes>we go into the Amex portal and initiate
the application for them.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/693-2
02:30:21.791 --> 02:30:26.000
<v Josh Sparkes>And then once we do that,
then we're happy with the application.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/693-3
02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:29.108
<v Josh Sparkes>Sorry.
Like we like request a card basically on</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/693-4
02:30:29.108 --> 02:30:32.021
<v Josh Sparkes>that portal for them.
So then the end of it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/694-0
02:30:32.101 --> 02:30:35.821
<v Josh Sparkes>Widget who we've replaced the card for on
behalf of.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/694-1
02:30:35.821 --> 02:30:41.646
<v Josh Sparkes>Then get an e-mail with two links and we
have to follow the steps on the links and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/694-2
02:30:41.646 --> 02:30:47.261
<v Josh Sparkes>go through the portal and provide the
information that Amex and are asking for.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/695-0
02:30:48.021 --> 02:30:53.384
<v Josh Sparkes>And then I believe we do get confirmation
back when that's done and then the cards</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/695-1
02:30:53.384 --> 02:30:56.227
<v Josh Sparkes>get sent to here.
And then if they're here,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/695-2
02:30:56.227 --> 02:31:00.040
<v Josh Sparkes>then when we're in the office,
they come and pick them up.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/695-3
02:31:00.040 --> 02:31:04.434
<v Josh Sparkes>And if they're in London,
we arranged for the Courier to go down to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/695-4
02:31:04.434 --> 02:31:07.341
<v Josh Sparkes>London with the cards and then we send
them.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/696-0
02:31:07.421 --> 02:31:11.623
<v Josh Sparkes>I have an e-mail to let you know that
that card's on the way,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/696-1
02:31:11.623 --> 02:31:17.112
<v Josh Sparkes>and sometimes we do get asked if they are
like travelling and as an **** card we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/696-2
02:31:17.112 --> 02:31:20.161
<v Josh Sparkes>can change the address to go to them
direct.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/696-3
02:31:20.161 --> 02:31:25.650
<v Josh Sparkes>That's been far between the some urgent
cases we get back so the Westpac or Amex</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/696-4
02:31:25.650 --> 02:31:27.141
<v Josh Sparkes>will contact you know.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/697-0
02:31:27.301 --> 02:31:32.960
<v Josh Sparkes>Application state application successful,
but at that point the card is still not</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/697-1
02:31:32.960 --> 02:31:36.825
<v Josh Sparkes>being issued.
That's just the fact that the application</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/697-2
02:31:36.825 --> 02:31:40.345
<v Josh Sparkes>has been done and there's another process
of that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/697-3
02:31:40.345 --> 02:31:45.245
<v Josh Sparkes>The individual then has to provide to
request the card. Is that right?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/697-4
02:31:45.245 --> 02:31:46.901
<v Josh Sparkes>Not no application goes.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/698-0
02:31:47.141 --> 02:31:51.477
<v Josh Sparkes>First back they put it through their
workflows and when we get the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/698-1
02:31:51.477 --> 02:31:56.202
<v Josh Sparkes>confirmation notification back, yeah,
it's application's been completed.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/698-2
02:31:56.202 --> 02:32:00.408
<v Josh Sparkes>Card has been issued, right?
So that basically happens same day.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/698-3
02:32:00.408 --> 02:32:05.521
<v Josh Sparkes>So once we get that confirmation e-mail,
we know that we can expect to receive</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/698-4
02:32:05.521 --> 02:32:06.621
<v Josh Sparkes>that card within.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/699-0
02:32:06.741 --> 02:32:10.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Five to seven business days,
so no involvement from the applicant or</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/699-1
02:32:10.660 --> 02:32:15.203
<v Josh Sparkes>on behalf of that point. No, not at all.
Until the applicant basically does not</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/699-2
02:32:15.203 --> 02:32:18.725
<v Josh Sparkes>have any involvement.
Once they've sent the forms back to us,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/699-3
02:32:18.725 --> 02:32:23.211
<v Josh Sparkes>AP then manages everything else from
there until the card holder needs to pick</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/699-4
02:32:23.211 --> 02:32:26.221
<v Josh Sparkes>up their card.
So but the Amex they then have to do.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/700-0
02:32:27.101 --> 02:32:31.420
<v Josh Sparkes>Please stay on the portal. Request card.
That's what we're saying.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/700-1
02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:34.643
<v Josh Sparkes>But I they just have to fill out the
application.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/700-2
02:32:34.643 --> 02:32:37.930
<v Josh Sparkes>So where Anna sends the forums,
that's part of it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/700-3
02:32:37.930 --> 02:32:42.249
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't send them a forum,
they we treat it and they go in online</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/700-4
02:32:42.249 --> 02:32:45.601
<v Josh Sparkes>and do that.
And once the cheques have been done by</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/700-5
02:32:45.601 --> 02:32:46.181
<v Josh Sparkes>the bank.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/701-0
02:32:46.421 --> 02:32:51.558
<v Josh Sparkes>Still approved by Amex then,
I think we get a notification to see that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/701-1
02:32:51.558 --> 02:32:55.971
<v Josh Sparkes>it's all approved. Again,
I'm still looking of an applicant,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/701-2
02:32:55.971 --> 02:33:01.396
<v Josh Sparkes>so applications on cars being issued,
if that's that's all self-service we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/701-3
02:33:01.396 --> 02:33:04.941
<v Josh Sparkes>could do deep link direct to Amex for UK
people.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/702-0
02:33:05.341 --> 02:33:08.139
<v Josh Sparkes>To the when we get on to their
notifications,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/702-1
02:33:08.139 --> 02:33:12.214
<v Josh Sparkes>they can be part of that link on their
part of their notification.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/702-2
02:33:12.214 --> 02:33:15.741
<v Josh Sparkes>When we get on to that one in the UK,
they get that link.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/703-0
02:33:20.141 --> 02:33:23.090
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
And there's the then the current issue</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/703-1
02:33:23.090 --> 02:33:24.941
<v Josh Sparkes>and then it can be sent to.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/704-0
02:33:26.381 --> 02:33:29.949
<v Josh Sparkes>And as part of the application,
the person may have said I'm going to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/704-1
02:33:29.949 --> 02:33:32.497
<v Josh Sparkes>collect direct from the office mentioned
in mind.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/704-2
02:33:32.497 --> 02:33:35.250
<v Josh Sparkes>Actually I'm now here in East Korea.
It's over there.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/704-3
02:33:35.250 --> 02:33:39.072
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's now it's being card advantage.
If you don't have card is received,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/704-4
02:33:39.072 --> 02:33:42.181
<v Josh Sparkes>do you want these to track that so that
there isn't delayed?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/705-0
02:33:42.501 --> 02:33:46.996
<v Josh Sparkes>So you're expecting it to arrive,
but it hasn't yet arrived.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/705-1
02:33:46.996 --> 02:33:52.080
<v Josh Sparkes>All of the cards in Australia get issued
or sent to Brisbane office,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/705-2
02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:57.459
<v Josh Sparkes>so my team pick get all the batches of
cards and then send it out to the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/705-3
02:33:57.459 --> 02:34:01.364
<v Josh Sparkes>relevant office.
It's similar to Warner on very rare</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/705-4
02:34:01.364 --> 02:34:02.101
<v Josh Sparkes>occasions.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/706-0
02:34:02.221 --> 02:34:05.301
<v Josh Sparkes>When it's absolutely necessary, we might.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/707-0
02:34:06.581 --> 02:34:09.201
<v Josh Sparkes>Arrange for a Courier direct to someone's
house.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/707-1
02:34:09.201 --> 02:34:13.210
<v Josh Sparkes>But that's yeah feeling far between.
The standard is send it to the office</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/707-2
02:34:13.210 --> 02:34:17.273
<v Josh Sparkes>cardholder. We e-mail the cardholders,
let them know that that's happening.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/707-3
02:34:17.273 --> 02:34:21.657
<v Josh Sparkes>So the day that we're sending them from
Brisbane, we will send an e-mail as well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/707-4
02:34:21.657 --> 02:34:23.581
<v Josh Sparkes>But notification to say it's coming.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/708-0
02:34:24.141 --> 02:34:29.145
<v Josh Sparkes>Pick it up within a day or two from the
workflow. The application flow? Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/708-1
02:34:29.145 --> 02:34:32.352
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail sign.
But I was just thinking of the date,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/708-2
02:34:32.352 --> 02:34:37.034
<v Josh Sparkes>but rather than having too many states,
you're waiting the card instead.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/708-3
02:34:37.034 --> 02:34:41.781
<v Josh Sparkes>It can move into card with issues.
So the fact that within that is being.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/710-0
02:34:42.181 --> 02:34:47.064
<v Josh Sparkes>Received an issue about with the you know
and then it's supposed complete</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/710-1
02:34:47.064 --> 02:34:51.749
<v Josh Sparkes>infergence with the cardboard.
You know now the cardboard. Yeah. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/710-2
02:34:51.749 --> 02:34:54.917
<v Josh Sparkes>but sorry, just Lorna. Currently,
if I'm wrong,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/710-3
02:34:54.917 --> 02:34:59.008
<v Josh Sparkes>I think I got different interpretation of
you mentioned Josh.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/710-4
02:34:59.008 --> 02:35:01.581
<v Josh Sparkes>Put in a deep link in the notification.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/711-0
02:35:02.101 --> 02:35:08.886
<v Josh Sparkes>I think what happens is Lorna's team
initiate the application and then is it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/711-1
02:35:08.886 --> 02:35:15.061
<v Josh Sparkes>Amex will then send the link to the
applicant person that's requested.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/712-0
02:35:16.421 --> 02:35:22.981
<v Josh Sparkes>You send the link. OK,
so you send the link to the applicant.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/713-0
02:35:26.661 --> 02:35:28.261
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, you send the link to the applicants.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/714-0
02:35:30.541 --> 02:35:35.442
<v Josh Sparkes>So AP you said Laura will send the links
as part of that notification of state</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/714-1
02:35:35.442 --> 02:35:40.157
<v Josh Sparkes>change that can be invented in their
notification that as you move to state</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/714-2
02:35:40.157 --> 02:35:45.120
<v Josh Sparkes>that that can be done for you and it
stands to link, isn't it? It doesn't have,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/714-3
02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:46.981
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah, OK. And they need their.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/715-0
02:35:48.861 --> 02:35:53.071
<v Josh Sparkes>They have an ID or is there something
that prompts them that that application</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/715-1
02:35:53.071 --> 02:35:56.741
<v Josh Sparkes>or it just is computing the applications
and it's and they have to?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/716-0
02:35:58.301 --> 02:35:58.461
<v Josh Sparkes>You.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/718-0
02:36:00.981 --> 02:36:04.799
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, is it is a replication of that, yes,
online application that's been filling</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/718-1
02:36:04.799 --> 02:36:08.245
<v Josh Sparkes>out all the information that the bank
requires for them because we're not</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/718-2
02:36:08.245 --> 02:36:12.063
<v Josh Sparkes>supposed to be doing that on their behalf.
So that's why we have to do it myself.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/718-3
02:36:12.063 --> 02:36:15.229
<v Josh Sparkes>It's pretty straightforward.
You don't put those bouncing back that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/718-4
02:36:15.229 --> 02:36:17.278
<v Josh Sparkes>this pending completes you know
incomplete.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/718-5
02:36:17.278 --> 02:36:18.861
<v Josh Sparkes>So they have done it properly and.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/719-0
02:36:19.901 --> 02:36:24.118
<v Josh Sparkes>They tend to be quite those particular
ones online because it's not paper,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/719-1
02:36:24.118 --> 02:36:28.336
<v Josh Sparkes>it's probably a lot of validation if they
have a, if they have a question,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/719-2
02:36:28.336 --> 02:36:32.103
<v Josh Sparkes>they will just chase us,
otherwise they submitted and if something</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/719-3
02:36:32.103 --> 02:36:33.621
<v Josh Sparkes>is wrong, it gets rejected.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/720-0
02:36:34.421 --> 02:36:38.017
<v Josh Sparkes>And the link is always the same for
everybody. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/720-1
02:36:38.017 --> 02:36:41.410
<v Josh Sparkes>And as far as I'm aware,
it's got instructions and it's quite easy</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/720-2
02:36:41.410 --> 02:36:44.297
<v Josh Sparkes>to go through.
It's like a standard forum that they need</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/720-3
02:36:44.297 --> 02:36:48.045
<v Josh Sparkes>to fill out where the mandatory fields
are there. So unlike Sandeep said,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/720-4
02:36:48.045 --> 02:36:50.931
<v Josh Sparkes>if they've got any issues,
then they come to us and ask,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/720-5
02:36:50.931 --> 02:36:52.501
<v Josh Sparkes>they're very identical address.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/721-0
02:36:54.301 --> 02:36:58.128
<v Josh Sparkes>Work address all that,
but any notes that we said I think Mark</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/721-1
02:36:58.128 --> 02:37:02.927
<v Josh Sparkes>was talking about the non liquor schools
to make sure that those reduce theirs</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/721-2
02:37:02.927 --> 02:37:07.240
<v Josh Sparkes>throughout that whole process is freeze
and and can anyone in business</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/721-3
02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:08.941
<v Josh Sparkes>technically request this or?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/722-0
02:37:09.261 --> 02:37:12.405
<v Josh Sparkes>With the application,
I know there's differences, partners,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/722-1
02:37:12.405 --> 02:37:16.491
<v Josh Sparkes>etcetera, but technically anybody can,
but the business case as well and they</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/722-2
02:37:16.491 --> 02:37:20.315
<v Josh Sparkes>have to put on how much they would
they're about are going to spend on a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/722-3
02:37:20.315 --> 02:37:23.721
<v Josh Sparkes>monthly basis if they come back and see
like they're only going,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/722-4
02:37:23.721 --> 02:37:27.021
<v Josh Sparkes>they're only going to be spent and see if
I take by the month.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/723-0
02:37:27.541 --> 02:37:32.330
<v Josh Sparkes>Then we would then push that back and say,
is there a chance that you could maybe</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/723-1
02:37:32.330 --> 02:37:36.535
<v Josh Sparkes>utilise the expense system and put
through that rather than get a card?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/723-2
02:37:36.535 --> 02:37:41.265
<v Josh Sparkes>Because then obviously we have to pay for
the subscriptions to the cards when it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/723-3
02:37:41.265 --> 02:37:42.141
<v Josh Sparkes>doesn't really.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/724-0
02:37:42.541 --> 02:37:46.604
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not feasible to do that.
They're only going to be spending £50 a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/724-1
02:37:46.604 --> 02:37:50.202
<v Josh Sparkes>month, so we are, we can push it back,
we do, but yeah, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/724-2
02:37:50.202 --> 02:37:51.421
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's part of that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/726-0
02:37:50.701 --> 02:37:53.440
<v Mark Sedge>These,
these these are some of the things that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/726-1
02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:56.645
<v Mark Sedge>we would you you're putting out in terms
of knowledge,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/726-2
02:37:56.645 --> 02:38:01.481
<v Mark Sedge>so highlighting you're almost asking the
leadership whether they could define that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/725-0
02:37:58.221 --> 02:37:58.461
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/726-3
02:38:01.481 --> 02:38:04.977
<v Mark Sedge>as a policy such that there's a way that
you can, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/726-4
02:38:04.977 --> 02:38:09.813
<v Mark Sedge>limit the amount of work you get you get
in because we're managing the expectation</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/726-5
02:38:09.813 --> 02:38:10.221
<v Mark Sedge>before.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/727-0
02:38:10.341 --> 02:38:12.941
<v Mark Sedge>Even raise, raise the inquiry, right?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/728-0
02:38:13.941 --> 02:38:18.187
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that's it, Mark.
We do have a global credit card policy</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/728-1
02:38:18.187 --> 02:38:23.598
<v Josh Sparkes>that does outline some clear guidelines
as to who is eligible and what you are</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/728-2
02:38:23.598 --> 02:38:29.282
<v Josh Sparkes>eligible for to apply for corporate card.
So it's part of the kind of the Internet</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/728-3
02:38:29.282 --> 02:38:32.501
<v Josh Sparkes>page that Australia has been utilising
for us.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/729-0
02:38:33.021 --> 02:38:37.536
<v Josh Sparkes>Four or five years,
some of the key points from that policy</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/729-1
02:38:37.536 --> 02:38:41.674
<v Josh Sparkes>has been included in that.
So really similar to Lorna.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/729-2
02:38:41.674 --> 02:38:47.467
<v Josh Sparkes>We specified that if you're just applying
for a corporate card for potential</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/729-3
02:38:47.467 --> 02:38:48.821
<v Josh Sparkes>overtime expenses.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/730-0
02:38:49.301 --> 02:38:52.541
<v Josh Sparkes>Then utilise our expense reimbursement
system.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/731-0
02:38:54.541 --> 02:38:54.661
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/732-0
02:38:56.341 --> 02:39:01.943
<v Josh Sparkes>Once they request a card and we get the
the notification and we send them the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/732-1
02:39:01.943 --> 02:39:07.330
<v Josh Sparkes>business case e-mail template and it
comes back when we send that business</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/732-2
02:39:07.330 --> 02:39:12.501
<v Josh Sparkes>case e-mail template we've got like steps
on the e-mail that says like.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/733-0
02:39:13.701 --> 02:39:16.521
<v Josh Sparkes>At least to have a valid business purpose,
if you're not.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/733-1
02:39:16.521 --> 02:39:20.265
<v Josh Sparkes>If you're only going to be using it for
small spend, could you do utilities?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/733-2
02:39:20.265 --> 02:39:23.231
<v Josh Sparkes>So it has detailed on it so that before
they even submit it,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/733-3
02:39:23.231 --> 02:39:25.517
<v Josh Sparkes>they can read that and say well on that
basis,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/733-4
02:39:25.517 --> 02:39:28.774
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't think if I applied for my card,
I'm going to get accepted.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/733-5
02:39:28.774 --> 02:39:29.941
<v Josh Sparkes>So then that would just.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/734-0
02:39:30.261 --> 02:39:33.303
<v Josh Sparkes>Like slop with that part of the long
example would be you.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/734-1
02:39:33.303 --> 02:39:35.572
<v Josh Sparkes>You know how I get one doesn't apply to
me.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/734-2
02:39:35.572 --> 02:39:38.253
<v Josh Sparkes>You know those types of things that will,
you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/734-3
02:39:38.253 --> 02:39:40.986
<v Josh Sparkes>answer those questions upfront rather
than just. Oh,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/734-4
02:39:40.986 --> 02:39:43.821
<v Josh Sparkes>I think I'll try and see if it's accepted
or rejected.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/735-0
02:39:45.221 --> 02:39:45.381
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/736-0
02:39:45.221 --> 02:39:49.562
<v Mark Sedge>The the other thing we might you you
might want to consider it and again not</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/736-1
02:39:49.562 --> 02:39:52.945
<v Mark Sedge>trying to solution too much,
but in the in the form itself.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/736-2
02:39:52.945 --> 02:39:57.568
<v Mark Sedge>If you have monthly spend you know then
they put a value in that's below whatever</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/736-3
02:39:57.568 --> 02:40:02.021
<v Mark Sedge>say it's 250 or something and they put
any value in you can flag it up to say.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/737-0
02:40:01.701 --> 02:40:02.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/739-0
02:40:02.381 --> 02:40:06.198
<v Mark Sedge>This isn't this isn't valid,
therefore you and therefore they can't</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/739-1
02:40:06.198 --> 02:40:10.800
<v Mark Sedge>submit it, so it forces them to, you know,
really think about it and back out the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/739-2
02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:14.953
<v Mark Sedge>form before doing a submission.
So you could do something like that where</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/739-3
02:40:14.953 --> 02:40:17.591
<v Mark Sedge>you put rules in the in that ballot,
you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/739-4
02:40:17.591 --> 02:40:20.621
<v Mark Sedge>in that estimated spend field to control
who submits.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/740-0
02:40:24.581 --> 02:40:28.860
<v Josh Sparkes>Well,
the idea however many cases in Australia,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/740-1
02:40:28.860 --> 02:40:35.901
<v Josh Sparkes>people have just gone and like changed
the their enrollment. Yeah, so we said.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/741-0
02:40:35.021 --> 02:40:37.690
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
but if even if the but the point is even</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/741-1
02:40:37.690 --> 02:40:41.039
<v Mark Sedge>if they do that,
and then you reject what you can start to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/741-2
02:40:41.039 --> 02:40:45.184
<v Mark Sedge>do is gather the metrics and then take
that up to the leadership to say,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/741-3
02:40:45.184 --> 02:40:49.272
<v Mark Sedge>here's the behaviour you need to
reinforce the policy and reinforce the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/741-4
02:40:49.272 --> 02:40:52.281
<v Mark Sedge>behaviours.
So over time you use the metric data you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/741-5
02:40:52.281 --> 02:40:54.381
<v Mark Sedge>gather to change, you know, and then.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/742-0
02:40:54.461 --> 02:40:58.636
<v Mark Sedge>Enable the leadership with some
data-driven content to actually drive the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/742-1
02:40:58.636 --> 02:41:01.964
<v Mark Sedge>right behaviour.
Change that you want and therefore you'll</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/742-2
02:41:01.964 --> 02:41:03.261
<v Mark Sedge>snuff it out over time.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/744-0
02:41:04.021 --> 02:41:06.964
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. I mean,
we have been trying to do that in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/744-1
02:41:06.964 --> 02:41:10.275
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia. The UK are much better than US,
Australia,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/744-2
02:41:10.275 --> 02:41:14.874
<v Josh Sparkes>there's a bit more of a culture of I
deserve a corporate card not I need a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/744-3
02:41:14.874 --> 02:41:18.185
<v Josh Sparkes>corporate card.
So we've been trying to move everyone</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/743-0
02:41:15.181 --> 02:41:15.661
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/744-4
02:41:18.185 --> 02:41:21.741
<v Josh Sparkes>away from that with the business case
templates and with.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/745-0
02:41:22.141 --> 02:41:27.707
<v Josh Sparkes>The spend the estimated spend limits with
approvals and you know for the additional</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/745-1
02:41:27.707 --> 02:41:31.814
<v Josh Sparkes>measures that we have,
but there are still cases that we have</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/745-2
02:41:31.814 --> 02:41:36.717
<v Josh Sparkes>partners coming to us and say no,
I'm approving for my staff and the type</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/745-3
02:41:36.717 --> 02:41:39.301
<v Josh Sparkes>of corporate card just give it to them.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/748-0
02:41:40.181 --> 02:41:45.455
<v Josh Sparkes>And there's not much we can do to push
back against that, unfortunately.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/748-1
02:41:45.455 --> 02:41:48.922
<v Josh Sparkes>So I I'm just. I'm not against it. Sorry,
mark.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/746-0
02:41:48.821 --> 02:41:49.021
<v Mark Sedge>Then.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/748-2
02:41:48.922 --> 02:41:54.556
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just questioning how valid it's going
to be for my purposes in Australia.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/748-3
02:41:54.556 --> 02:41:57.301
<v Josh Sparkes>And I think we have a lot bigger of a.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/747-0
02:41:55.221 --> 02:41:55.621
<v Mark Sedge>Well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/749-0
02:41:58.341 --> 02:42:04.992
<v Josh Sparkes>We have over it's very close to 700
corporate cards in issue around Australia</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/749-1
02:42:04.992 --> 02:42:10.961
<v Josh Sparkes>and it's we're processing more
applications than we can cancel in the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/749-2
02:42:10.961 --> 02:42:12.581
<v Josh Sparkes>last 12 months, so.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/751-0
02:42:12.421 --> 02:42:15.180
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, but I think again,
maybe it's something we,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/750-0
02:42:13.421 --> 02:42:13.541
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/751-1
02:42:15.180 --> 02:42:17.995
<v Mark Sedge>even though it might not have an
immediate impact,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/751-2
02:42:17.995 --> 02:42:21.912
<v Mark Sedge>it would be something that would enable
you to have metrics, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/751-3
02:42:21.912 --> 02:42:24.395
<v Mark Sedge>real proper data that says this is how
many.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/751-4
02:42:24.395 --> 02:42:28.920
<v Mark Sedge>And the other thing you might choose to
do as an organisation is use some to take</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/751-5
02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:30.741
<v Mark Sedge>your point about the sort of 700.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/752-0
02:42:30.941 --> 02:42:34.817
<v Mark Sedge>Across you could direct you know by
method you could say this.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/752-1
02:42:34.817 --> 02:42:38.939
<v Mark Sedge>This actually costs each whether it's
each office or each partner.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/752-2
02:42:38.939 --> 02:42:42.814
<v Mark Sedge>You could say by your choice by your just
give it to my staff.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/752-3
02:42:42.814 --> 02:42:47.490
<v Mark Sedge>This is what it costs you and although
you can do some although it's wooden</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/752-4
02:42:47.490 --> 02:42:50.381
<v Mark Sedge>dollars,
you could probably do a cross charge.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/753-0
02:42:50.581 --> 02:42:53.658
<v Mark Sedge>Position to say there this is what that
cost means,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/753-1
02:42:53.658 --> 02:42:58.156
<v Mark Sedge>and again sometimes that enables an
organisation to take a step back and go</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/753-2
02:42:58.156 --> 02:43:02.653
<v Mark Sedge>actually do we really need those?
Because if it if you know if it isn't all</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/753-3
02:43:02.653 --> 02:43:06.381
<v Mark Sedge>about the bottom line and the profit for
the for the partners.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/754-0
02:43:06.661 --> 02:43:08.901
<v Mark Sedge>That would be something that you'd want
them to be thinking about.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/755-0
02:43:11.701 --> 02:43:12.781
<v Josh Sparkes>No, completely I think.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/756-0
02:43:14.141 --> 02:43:16.461
<v Josh Sparkes>Agree with you, Mark,
I think we need to look into that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/757-0
02:43:18.341 --> 02:43:21.784
<v Josh Sparkes>At least this flow will allow you to
report on. I mean, not that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/757-1
02:43:21.784 --> 02:43:25.228
<v Josh Sparkes>So now it's going to report the
behaviours that you already know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/757-2
02:43:25.228 --> 02:43:29.349
<v Josh Sparkes>but it gives you the supporting evidence
that these have been injected because</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/757-3
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:32.636
<v Josh Sparkes>you've got court cases you can report on
them. Well, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/757-4
02:43:32.636 --> 02:43:36.705
<v Josh Sparkes>it gives you that evidence upfront,
but I think alluded to that there was the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/757-5
02:43:36.705 --> 02:43:38.061
<v Josh Sparkes>ability, if you wanted it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/758-0
02:43:38.541 --> 02:43:42.561
<v Josh Sparkes>While she's got the upper limits,
you've also can set lower limits,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/758-1
02:43:42.561 --> 02:43:47.290
<v Josh Sparkes>but that can come from the insights on
the rejection rates that you've got that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/758-2
02:43:47.290 --> 02:43:50.541
<v Josh Sparkes>we can build that in as well.
Is it possible to carry?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/759-0
02:43:56.141 --> 02:44:00.628
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that my name in the workflow?
Is it possible first service now on that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/759-1
02:44:00.628 --> 02:44:05.356
<v Josh Sparkes>manager's approval to directly send the
link if you're auk based application,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/759-2
02:44:05.356 --> 02:44:08.994
<v Josh Sparkes>but the forms directly if you're an
Australian application,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/759-3
02:44:08.994 --> 02:44:12.449
<v Josh Sparkes>so the team don't need to do any steps in
between. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/759-4
02:44:12.449 --> 02:44:15.541
<v Josh Sparkes>So for the go back to the so if it goes
into that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/760-0
02:44:15.781 --> 02:44:18.612
<v Josh Sparkes>Approval.
But you're sending the link they would</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/760-1
02:44:18.612 --> 02:44:22.540
<v Josh Sparkes>put that department notification that
we're getting to. So we have.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/760-2
02:44:22.540 --> 02:44:25.890
<v Josh Sparkes>That's fine with groups where because you
in this domain,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/760-3
02:44:25.890 --> 02:44:29.875
<v Josh Sparkes>this location that can be done,
but we're then you're saying for the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/760-4
02:44:29.875 --> 02:44:33.341
<v Josh Sparkes>alien to attach different forms of the
service now can you?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/761-0
02:44:34.621 --> 02:44:40.882
<v Josh Sparkes>If there's any like any of those instead,
yeah, I wonder.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/761-1
02:44:40.882 --> 02:44:49.086
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just thinking about that Muslim
direction rather than whether they link</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/761-2
02:44:49.086 --> 02:44:50.381
<v Josh Sparkes>those forms.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/763-0
02:44:51.341 --> 02:44:56.730
<v Josh Sparkes>Be so these are two PDF forms as part of
the Westpac application,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/762-0
02:44:51.421 --> 02:44:54.221
<v Mark Sedge>I didn't hear. Sorry. I I didn't hear.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/763-1
02:44:56.730 --> 02:45:03.181
<v Josh Sparkes>so APEX has the link online which is
standard for everybody to complete in the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/763-2
02:45:03.181 --> 02:45:09.141
<v Josh Sparkes>UK and the Westpac have two PDFs that the
people from Australia fill in.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/765-0
02:45:09.941 --> 02:45:13.050
<v Josh Sparkes>And to return.
So I'm saying and the question from</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/765-1
02:45:13.050 --> 02:45:16.097
<v Josh Sparkes>Lauren is,
can those two forms be attached to the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/765-2
02:45:16.097 --> 02:45:19.572
<v Josh Sparkes>notification triggered by managed by
approval step step?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/765-3
02:45:19.572 --> 02:45:23.656
<v Josh Sparkes>Basically a status change.
And I'm just looking for your direction</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/765-4
02:45:23.656 --> 02:45:26.581
<v Josh Sparkes>on that feasibility and whether it's
something.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/768-0
02:45:24.861 --> 02:45:28.907
<v Mark Sedge>I've I've seen. I've seen that. Yeah,
I've seen that before. So sometimes,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/766-0
02:45:27.101 --> 02:45:27.421
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/768-1
02:45:28.907 --> 02:45:31.659
<v Mark Sedge>you know,
especially if there's sort of data to be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/768-2
02:45:31.659 --> 02:45:35.057
<v Mark Sedge>populated that then comes back in.
I've seen elements of that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/768-3
02:45:35.057 --> 02:45:39.103
<v Mark Sedge>I'll probably bow to Parrick's guidance
on that. And he's got his hand up.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/767-0
02:45:38.821 --> 02:45:39.141
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/768-4
02:45:39.103 --> 02:45:41.261
<v Mark Sedge>Brilliant. I'll let you go, mate. Go on.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/770-0
02:45:42.621 --> 02:45:45.159
<v Parik Narain>Great. Thanks, Deborah.
Just those two PDFs,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/770-1
02:45:45.159 --> 02:45:49.671
<v Parik Narain>are they attached to the actual request
or are they going to be attached to the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/770-2
02:45:49.671 --> 02:45:54.239
<v Parik Narain>tasks because we can pick pick up from
both basically as long as we can identify</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/770-3
02:45:54.239 --> 02:45:55.141
<v Parik Narain>and distinguish?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/771-0
02:45:55.621 --> 02:45:58.901
<v Parik Narain>Those forms from each other,
either by a name or something.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/774-0
02:45:59.821 --> 02:46:02.442
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
they're both to be completed for that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/774-1
02:46:02.442 --> 02:46:04.885
<v Josh Sparkes>workflow.
They're part of the one to one</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/774-2
02:46:04.885 --> 02:46:09.114
<v Josh Sparkes>relationship for that application.
The point is we put a link to where</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/772-0
02:46:04.901 --> 02:46:05.101
<v Parik Narain>Good.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/773-0
02:46:08.501 --> 02:46:08.941
<v Parik Narain>That's right.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/774-3
02:46:09.114 --> 02:46:13.760
<v Josh Sparkes>they're stored and then they're completed
or where there was part of service.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/774-4
02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:16.381
<v Josh Sparkes>Now they are PDS. They're not,
they're not.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/775-0
02:46:16.221 --> 02:46:17.781
<v Parik Narain>Yeah. So.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/778-0
02:46:17.101 --> 02:46:20.888
<v Josh Sparkes>They're not forms to be completed at an
attachment. I mean,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/776-0
02:46:19.141 --> 02:46:19.301
<v Parik Narain>S.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/778-1
02:46:20.888 --> 02:46:25.622
<v Josh Sparkes>it would be easy to have a link to a
local intranet page or something that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/777-0
02:46:21.021 --> 02:46:22.061
<v Parik Narain>Both options work.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/778-2
02:46:25.622 --> 02:46:30.734
<v Josh Sparkes>someone can still click on the link and
download the forms themselves because we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/778-3
02:46:30.734 --> 02:46:33.890
<v Josh Sparkes>can do that,
we can house the forms online on our</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/778-4
02:46:33.890 --> 02:46:35.341
<v Josh Sparkes>intranet instead, yeah?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/780-0
02:46:35.541 --> 02:46:38.077
<v Parik Narain>You're right,
that would be a better option because</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/780-1
02:46:38.077 --> 02:46:41.344
<v Parik Narain>obviously you don't want to keep keep
service as a document store.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/780-2
02:46:41.344 --> 02:46:44.269
<v Parik Narain>So if the documents have to be downloaded
again and edited,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/779-0
02:46:43.381 --> 02:46:45.621
<v Josh Sparkes>And it was actually, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/780-3
02:46:44.269 --> 02:46:47.682
<v Parik Narain>I would say we can send the link to that
Internet page in the e-mail.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/783-0
02:46:47.381 --> 02:46:51.150
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
that could be really good because one of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/780-4
02:46:47.682 --> 02:46:48.901
<v Parik Narain>That's much better, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/783-1
02:46:51.150 --> 02:46:55.881
<v Josh Sparkes>the forms does get updated you on an
annual basis usually.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/783-2
02:46:55.881 --> 02:47:02.617
<v Josh Sparkes>So it would be much easier for us to then
change that when it's appropriate control</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/781-0
02:46:57.021 --> 02:46:57.221
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/782-0
02:47:00.661 --> 02:47:02.061
<v Parik Narain>Absolutely agree, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/783-3
02:47:02.617 --> 02:47:04.301
<v Josh Sparkes>of that. So that URL.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/784-0
02:47:04.981 --> 02:47:09.490
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that won't change. Changing. Yeah.
Then similar to the the fact that it's a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/784-1
02:47:09.490 --> 02:47:12.954
<v Josh Sparkes>link internally. Well,
then it's link externally that could be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/784-2
02:47:12.954 --> 02:47:17.188
<v Josh Sparkes>incorporated. Yeah, that would be helpful.
Notification. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/784-3
02:47:17.188 --> 02:47:20.707
<v Josh Sparkes>that's easy for you guys.
That's really easy for us, too. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/784-4
02:47:20.707 --> 02:47:24.061
<v Josh Sparkes>And then you sort the ownership of where
it is, the updates.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/786-0
02:47:24.221 --> 02:47:27.221
<v Josh Sparkes>Those forms? Yeah. OK.
That's a good landing. Thank you.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/785-0
02:47:25.261 --> 02:47:25.501
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/787-0
02:47:27.221 --> 02:47:30.728
<v Parik Narain>And what we can also do is we can have a
placeholder in the task which is</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/787-1
02:47:30.728 --> 02:47:34.329
<v Parik Narain>specifically for that and say can you
please paste the link here and that's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/787-2
02:47:34.329 --> 02:47:38.262
<v Parik Narain>much easier then you can manage that link
within the task and then e-mail picks it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/787-3
02:47:38.262 --> 02:47:39.541
<v Parik Narain>up as well as it turns out.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/790-0
02:47:40.021 --> 02:47:42.970
<v Josh Sparkes>Because it's always going to be similar
character,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/790-1
02:47:42.970 --> 02:47:47.423
<v Josh Sparkes>the apex is always the same link,
and for Westpac it's always the same link.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/790-2
02:47:47.423 --> 02:47:52.107
<v Josh Sparkes>Therefore we can I mean in the conflict
that we're doing the part of your matrix</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/788-0
02:47:48.101 --> 02:47:48.341
<v Parik Narain>Hmm.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/790-3
02:47:52.107 --> 02:47:55.981
<v Josh Sparkes>we can just maintain the link named,
you know it's not harm coded.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/789-0
02:47:54.901 --> 02:47:55.181
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/791-0
02:47:56.301 --> 02:48:01.481
<v Josh Sparkes>We can have the leak happens to change
and we can just change it in the the back</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/791-1
02:48:01.481 --> 02:48:05.445
<v Josh Sparkes>end and then the e-mail would pick it up
naturally, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/791-2
02:48:05.445 --> 02:48:08.707
<v Josh Sparkes>go and look for the new URL and it can be
updated.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/791-3
02:48:08.707 --> 02:48:12.607
<v Josh Sparkes>So if you had for example to think about
the future scaling,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/791-4
02:48:12.607 --> 02:48:15.101
<v Josh Sparkes>let's say you incorporate another card.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/792-0
02:48:15.501 --> 02:48:21.644
<v Josh Sparkes>You will have another URL for where those
documents are potentially. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/792-1
02:48:21.644 --> 02:48:26.313
<v Josh Sparkes>the link for the UK cards doesn't come
from the EP team,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/792-2
02:48:26.313 --> 02:48:32.701
<v Josh Sparkes>but I think that comes from Amex direct,
so once we initiate the application.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/793-0
02:48:33.021 --> 02:48:38.061
<v Josh Sparkes>That then triggers to emails to be sent
to the individual and they need to follow</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/793-1
02:48:38.061 --> 02:48:42.855
<v Josh Sparkes>the instructions on them to complete
their application once their application</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/793-2
02:48:42.855 --> 02:48:46.113
<v Josh Sparkes>is complete,
we then get notification and we have to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/793-3
02:48:46.113 --> 02:48:49.739
<v Josh Sparkes>go into the portal,
check that they've put all the correct</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/793-4
02:48:49.739 --> 02:48:50.661
<v Josh Sparkes>information in.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/794-0
02:48:51.101 --> 02:48:55.454
<v Josh Sparkes>And then at that point, when we submit it,
then that's when the back and forth</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/794-1
02:48:55.454 --> 02:48:59.861
<v Josh Sparkes>happened between Amex and the applicant.
We only then get notified once the the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/794-2
02:48:59.861 --> 02:49:03.002
<v Josh Sparkes>card disapproved.
Then it's on the street to us and then</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/794-3
02:49:03.002 --> 02:49:05.922
<v Josh Sparkes>you do that,
it's clarifying because I don't usually</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/794-4
02:49:05.922 --> 02:49:08.621
<v Josh Sparkes>do that part. So I was just making sure.
Thanks.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/795-0
02:49:09.541 --> 02:49:10.181
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's good.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/796-0
02:49:15.101 --> 02:49:23.261
<v Josh Sparkes>That's thought I've heard of applying for
fine for itself. Thank you.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/797-0
02:49:25.101 --> 02:49:28.182
<v Josh Sparkes>OK,
so I think the good work for those the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/797-1
02:49:28.182 --> 02:49:33.913
<v Josh Sparkes>stages including the notification up to
the data captured by the request as you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/797-2
02:49:33.913 --> 02:49:37.280
<v Josh Sparkes>said, which is very it's regulatory,
isn't it,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/797-3
02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:42.581
<v Josh Sparkes>they've got to you've got to comply with
the request from both providers.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/798-0
02:49:43.101 --> 02:49:46.614
<v Josh Sparkes>Unit lands with that we discussed and
just to confirm,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/798-1
02:49:46.614 --> 02:49:51.341
<v Josh Sparkes>I think there was that US one that one
land would be UK, is that correct?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/799-0
02:49:53.621 --> 02:49:58.439
<v Josh Sparkes>They're going down the similar route to
the EE and the UK just now,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/799-1
02:49:58.439 --> 02:50:03.541
<v Josh Sparkes>and it was a different process,
but are on boarding them through the UK</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/799-2
02:50:03.541 --> 02:50:08.642
<v Josh Sparkes>process very, very the US. Yeah.
So that will be assigned all to the UK</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/799-3
02:50:08.642 --> 02:50:09.421
<v Josh Sparkes>for the US.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/800-0
02:50:10.861 --> 02:50:14.214
<v Josh Sparkes>We manage those ones going forward and
the is the link,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/800-1
02:50:14.214 --> 02:50:18.285
<v Josh Sparkes>so the the detail that they need to
complete are similar to the UK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/800-2
02:50:18.285 --> 02:50:20.141
<v Josh Sparkes>So we have to align to that UK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/801-0
02:50:21.781 --> 02:50:26.101
<v Josh Sparkes>It's our same links saying annexes,
not second cases.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/801-1
02:50:26.101 --> 02:50:31.861
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't know that yet because of course
like from. If you're from now,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/801-2
02:50:31.861 --> 02:50:34.181
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm wearing a different type.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/802-0
02:50:36.941 --> 02:50:40.923
<v Josh Sparkes>It's gonna be UK entity,
but the requesters or the users will be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/802-1
02:50:40.923 --> 02:50:43.985
<v Josh Sparkes>based in the US,
so if you know like how those US</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/802-2
02:50:43.985 --> 02:50:47.231
<v Josh Sparkes>regulations are like the factor
regulations and all,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/802-3
02:50:47.231 --> 02:50:51.703
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know if there's gonna be
additional people work to be filled out</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/802-4
02:50:51.703 --> 02:50:52.621
<v Josh Sparkes>by then or not.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/803-0
02:50:53.061 --> 02:50:56.689
<v Josh Sparkes>And before I left for my holidays,
it was just kind of like a discussion</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/803-1
02:50:56.689 --> 02:51:00.466
<v Josh Sparkes>that, yeah, they they're happy to do it,
but I don't know if they have any.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/803-2
02:51:00.466 --> 02:51:02.751
<v Josh Sparkes>So there isn't given I guess something.
Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/803-3
02:51:02.751 --> 02:51:06.528
<v Josh Sparkes>Different link as part of that whole big
different link and maybe couple of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/803-4
02:51:06.528 --> 02:51:09.261
<v Josh Sparkes>additional cheques which they might need.
OK. Alright.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/804-0
02:51:10.261 --> 02:51:17.741
<v Josh Sparkes>We catch that and when they're sent to
when Amex release them for the US.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/805-0
02:51:19.061 --> 02:51:23.559
<v Josh Sparkes>Are they process or you get them all or
how? No. So we don't know.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/805-1
02:51:23.559 --> 02:51:28.661
<v Josh Sparkes>We we don't do that at the minute so that
the USS will do their own before.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/805-2
02:51:28.661 --> 02:51:32.487
<v Josh Sparkes>So we don't know.
So that's a discussion I think we can.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/805-3
02:51:32.487 --> 02:51:34.501
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Yeah. OK that's perfect.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/806-0
02:51:36.421 --> 02:51:40.641
<v Josh Sparkes>I think because for us it will be
important as well once we onboard them</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/806-1
02:51:40.641 --> 02:51:44.919
<v Josh Sparkes>because we'll have to map all the
procedures and everything and add it at</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/806-2
02:51:44.919 --> 02:51:45.901
<v Josh Sparkes>the USPS as well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/807-0
02:51:49.141 --> 02:51:53.127
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.
There's notifications that we've stopped</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/807-1
02:51:53.127 --> 02:51:57.956
<v Josh Sparkes>with the links and then cards arrive,
and then they're issued.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/807-2
02:51:57.956 --> 02:52:03.781
<v Josh Sparkes>And it would say to those complete and so
said, that's the nice happy path.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/808-0
02:52:07.661 --> 02:52:12.327
<v Josh Sparkes>We're just carrying on and then we've got
the joiners movers leave the processes</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/808-1
02:52:12.327 --> 02:52:16.993
<v Josh Sparkes>and maybe promotions you have the right
to have a cars rather than wanting a car</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/808-2
02:52:16.993 --> 02:52:20.162
<v Josh Sparkes>and all that in between.
And then there's this sort of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/808-3
02:52:20.162 --> 02:52:24.021
<v Josh Sparkes>cancellation process that may return.
I think one of your process.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/809-0
02:52:24.421 --> 02:52:29.175
<v Josh Sparkes>So that it's not because they're leaving,
it might be endless secondment or A and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/809-1
02:52:29.175 --> 02:52:32.248
<v Josh Sparkes>others maybe,
I don't know how many of those who you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/809-2
02:52:32.248 --> 02:52:36.886
<v Josh Sparkes>have negative that overspend or we need
to cancel whatever for any other reason</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/809-3
02:52:36.886 --> 02:52:39.901
<v Josh Sparkes>but maybe that's the process that we can
just have.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/810-0
02:52:40.621 --> 02:52:44.178
<v Josh Sparkes>Or do you have those?
They're coming often, endless comment,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/810-1
02:52:44.178 --> 02:52:47.443
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe the endless comment.
It's an easy one to discuss.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/810-2
02:52:47.443 --> 02:52:52.049
<v Josh Sparkes>So they're part of the application.
Do you capture if we can get that upfront,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/810-3
02:52:52.049 --> 02:52:56.421
<v Josh Sparkes>you say effective end date and therefore
you already got the cancellation?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/811-0
02:52:56.781 --> 02:52:59.261
<v Josh Sparkes>Process that could be a subtask of the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/812-0
02:53:00.941 --> 02:53:05.455
<v Josh Sparkes>Operation of the corporate powers,
the secondment side of things that more</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/812-1
02:53:05.455 --> 02:53:10.029
<v Josh Sparkes>in Australia it's more common that
someone is leaving Australia to 2nd into</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/812-2
02:53:10.029 --> 02:53:13.821
<v Josh Sparkes>the UK or a different office.
So for our secondments it's more</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/812-3
02:53:13.821 --> 02:53:17.252
<v Josh Sparkes>associated with the cancellation upon
leaving Australia,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/812-4
02:53:17.252 --> 02:53:20.381
<v Josh Sparkes>which that then counts as the joiners
movers leave.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/813-0
02:53:20.541 --> 02:53:24.615
<v Josh Sparkes>It's processed.
I think that's not believe this process</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/813-1
02:53:24.615 --> 02:53:29.271
<v Josh Sparkes>for like, yeah. So yeah,
I mean I think it's considered a lever</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/813-2
02:53:29.271 --> 02:53:33.853
<v Josh Sparkes>for for Australia. Oh, OK.
But I think secondment's short term</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/813-3
02:53:33.853 --> 02:53:36.181
<v Josh Sparkes>consequence will come in the UK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/814-0
02:53:36.621 --> 02:53:36.741
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/815-0
02:53:38.421 --> 02:53:43.944
<v Josh Sparkes>Them and I believe when we get them,
we've got a log and we fill that out and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/815-1
02:53:43.944 --> 02:53:49.537
<v Josh Sparkes>we put an end date of when the expected
secondment is going to end and then we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/815-2
02:53:49.537 --> 02:53:53.501
<v Josh Sparkes>reach out to them near that end date to
see how should.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/816-0
02:53:54.421 --> 02:53:59.644
<v Josh Sparkes>Secondment going to be extended or do we
cancel the card and then I think if it's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/816-1
02:53:59.644 --> 02:54:04.612
<v Josh Sparkes>extended then it just goes down the route
of a new card instead of it being a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/816-2
02:54:04.612 --> 02:54:08.179
<v Josh Sparkes>secondment card.
After that point I would need to check</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/816-3
02:54:08.179 --> 02:54:10.981
<v Josh Sparkes>that. So if we think about that,
so in the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/817-0
02:54:11.541 --> 02:54:14.588
<v Josh Sparkes>Creation of new that like would you
manage vendors?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/817-1
02:54:14.588 --> 02:54:19.509
<v Josh Sparkes>That's a sub task of the overall process.
Could there be a factor that this type of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/817-2
02:54:19.509 --> 02:54:22.672
<v Josh Sparkes>card is for?
So it's what it's being used for in this</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/817-3
02:54:22.672 --> 02:54:26.421
<v Josh Sparkes>case and if it's a comment,
you can have an effective end date.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/818-0
02:54:26.941 --> 02:54:29.737
<v Josh Sparkes>That's part of your reporting or
dashboard. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/818-1
02:54:29.737 --> 02:54:33.762
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's not an actual process separate or
within our stands on its own,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/818-2
02:54:33.762 --> 02:54:37.284
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's part of the overall workflow.
So you're capturing it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/818-3
02:54:37.284 --> 02:54:41.142
<v Josh Sparkes>We know it's for the Commons.
We know it's got an effective end date</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/818-4
02:54:41.142 --> 02:54:45.894
<v Josh Sparkes>and the approach that end date we've got,
we can help with dashboard that, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/818-5
02:54:45.894 --> 02:54:46.341
<v Josh Sparkes>confirm.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/819-0
02:54:47.461 --> 02:54:52.963
<v Josh Sparkes>That it's going to be extended or we can
cancel the card. Yeah. I mean,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/819-1
02:54:52.963 --> 02:54:57.165
<v Josh Sparkes>if we can have it as part of the
application workflow,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/819-2
02:54:57.165 --> 02:55:03.049
<v Josh Sparkes>can we preset a date in ServiceNow and
say notify me in September 2027 for a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/819-3
02:55:03.049 --> 02:55:06.181
<v Josh Sparkes>second that's ending in October 20, 2027?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/823-0
02:55:06.661 --> 02:55:09.089
<v Josh Sparkes>So we can notify the application
applicant,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/823-1
02:55:09.089 --> 02:55:13.614
<v Josh Sparkes>notify all your dashboards that has a you
know it depends with your notifications</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/823-2
02:55:13.614 --> 02:55:17.698
<v Josh Sparkes>you know when they're in the past,
but you can have because it's all your</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/823-3
02:55:17.698 --> 02:55:20.844
<v Josh Sparkes>dash. Yeah. Yes,
you can have either sometimes with high</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/820-0
02:55:18.621 --> 02:55:18.701
<v Mark Sedge>The.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/823-4
02:55:20.844 --> 02:55:24.375
<v Josh Sparkes>volumes you just get slowly.
You get so many notifications that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/821-0
02:55:21.061 --> 02:55:21.861
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, that's what.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/823-5
02:55:24.375 --> 02:55:26.141
<v Josh Sparkes>they're white noise effectively.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/822-0
02:55:25.581 --> 02:55:26.021
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/826-0
02:55:26.221 --> 02:55:30.423
<v Josh Sparkes>And some people put them into another
inbox so you don't even read them,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/826-1
02:55:30.423 --> 02:55:34.798
<v Josh Sparkes>but you could have it that to set the
behaviour and notifications are good,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/826-2
02:55:34.798 --> 02:55:39.288
<v Josh Sparkes>but then you get used to going to the
dashboard where you can see it's coming</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/826-3
02:55:39.288 --> 02:55:42.453
<v Josh Sparkes>to a end date,
but either the notifications work quite</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/825-0
02:55:40.061 --> 02:55:41.221
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/826-4
02:55:42.453 --> 02:55:42.741
<v Josh Sparkes>well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/828-0
02:55:43.261 --> 02:55:46.735
<v Mark Sedge>In support of that, yeah,
some of those where it's quite long</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/828-1
02:55:46.735 --> 02:55:49.481
<v Mark Sedge>ranging,
having it on the dashboard that soon as</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/828-2
02:55:49.481 --> 02:55:52.002
<v Mark Sedge>something comes into range,
it just pops up.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/828-3
02:55:52.002 --> 02:55:55.364
<v Mark Sedge>You know you the and I think that's what
Deborah is saying,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/828-4
02:55:55.364 --> 02:55:57.941
<v Mark Sedge>the risk of having high volume
notifications.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/829-0
02:55:58.341 --> 02:56:01.112
<v Mark Sedge>You know you can't always see the wood
for the trees,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/829-1
02:56:01.112 --> 02:56:05.269
<v Mark Sedge>but having a particular section of your
dashboard which highlights second is due</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/829-2
02:56:05.269 --> 02:56:09.015
<v Mark Sedge>to conclude is an easy one because it's
it literally hits you real time.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/829-3
02:56:09.015 --> 02:56:12.658
<v Mark Sedge>You haven't got to leave the tool set to
go and look to see what other</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/829-4
02:56:12.658 --> 02:56:13.941
<v Mark Sedge>notifications you've got.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/830-0
02:56:14.301 --> 02:56:19.068
<v Mark Sedge>Would be a real and also the advantage of
doing that is that if it's something that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/830-1
02:56:19.068 --> 02:56:23.154
<v Mark Sedge>a dashboard that all of your your group
can see, then everyone can see.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/830-2
02:56:23.154 --> 02:56:26.842
<v Mark Sedge>Everyone can catch it.
You know you can decide amongst you who's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/830-3
02:56:26.842 --> 02:56:30.701
<v Mark Sedge>going to pick it up and action it.
It becomes easier operationally.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/831-0
02:56:31.461 --> 02:56:34.874
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm gonna add to that EU is actually
plural 'cause you're seeing.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/831-1
02:56:34.874 --> 02:56:38.494
<v Josh Sparkes>It's agreeable with actually.
So we can't say it's applications would</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/831-2
02:56:38.494 --> 02:56:41.131
<v Josh Sparkes>be. Yeah. Yeah.
So if we have it on the dashboard,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/831-3
02:56:41.131 --> 02:56:44.544
<v Josh Sparkes>everyone in the team sees it.
So it doesn't matter if someone has</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/831-4
02:56:44.544 --> 02:56:47.181
<v Josh Sparkes>processed the card for.
It's a comment they leave.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/832-0
02:56:47.501 --> 02:56:50.981
<v Josh Sparkes>Anyone could pick it up? Yeah.
And it's kind of a set and forget, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/833-0
02:56:51.421 --> 02:56:51.701
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/834-0
02:56:52.261 --> 02:56:55.908
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, you can assign it to,
so if they're visually for all or you go</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/834-1
02:56:55.908 --> 02:56:58.286
<v Josh Sparkes>away,
some people pick it up and it's there,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/834-2
02:56:58.286 --> 02:57:02.249
<v Josh Sparkes>as you said, if it's a long lead into it,
as Mark said that it can pop up.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/834-3
02:57:02.249 --> 02:57:04.892
<v Josh Sparkes>So actually your dashboard changes that
you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/834-4
02:57:04.892 --> 02:57:08.221
<v Josh Sparkes>otherwise if it's there on the left hand
side just growing in.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/835-0
02:57:08.781 --> 02:57:11.594
<v Josh Sparkes>Approaching that date,
but if it's within a within a month,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/835-1
02:57:11.594 --> 02:57:14.126
<v Josh Sparkes>it's coming up.
There's some activity that we need to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/835-2
02:57:14.126 --> 02:57:14.501
<v Josh Sparkes>present.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/836-0
02:57:18.501 --> 02:57:23.476
<v Mark Sedge>What we also need to do is just join up
with the HR work stream, just in case.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/836-1
02:57:23.476 --> 02:57:28.073
<v Mark Sedge>Say, that's a condiments extended.
What we want to make sure is that you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/836-2
02:57:28.073 --> 02:57:30.907
<v Mark Sedge>know,
there's enough join up within the tool</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/836-3
02:57:30.907 --> 02:57:33.741
<v Mark Sedge>that logically that trigger date then
moves.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/837-0
02:57:34.021 --> 02:57:36.821
<v Mark Sedge>Align with the secondary details.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/838-0
02:57:37.341 --> 02:57:39.949
<v Josh Sparkes>I think, Marcus,
I think you think that the new card</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/838-1
02:57:39.949 --> 02:57:43.491
<v Josh Sparkes>request that comes from extended is that
right? Because it's expensive.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/838-2
02:57:43.491 --> 02:57:46.296
<v Josh Sparkes>So you've just taken the words out my
mouth there, Mark,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/838-3
02:57:46.296 --> 02:57:49.543
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just wanting to ask,
is there any cutover from the people's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/838-4
02:57:49.543 --> 02:57:52.101
<v Josh Sparkes>requirement process that triggers any
part of this?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/841-0
02:57:53.381 --> 02:57:56.095
<v Mark Sedge>I think we do.
We need to take an action just to we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/839-0
02:57:55.781 --> 02:57:56.181
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/841-1
02:57:56.095 --> 02:57:59.592
<v Mark Sedge>understand what you're what you're doing
operationally yourselves.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/841-2
02:57:59.592 --> 02:58:03.663
<v Mark Sedge>We need to take an action just to sort of
dovetail that in and make sure that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/841-3
02:58:03.663 --> 02:58:06.429
<v Mark Sedge>there's not any, you know,
from an enterprise level,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/841-4
02:58:06.429 --> 02:58:10.396
<v Mark Sedge>whether there's some advantages or
trigger points that we can utilise or at</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/840-0
02:58:09.701 --> 02:58:11.701
<v Josh Sparkes>But we can move that out. Yeah, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/841-5
02:58:10.396 --> 02:58:12.901
<v Mark Sedge>least catch.
So you don't get a false positive.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/842-0
02:58:14.021 --> 02:58:17.402
<v Josh Sparkes>Thanks, mark. Yeah,
at the end of the day with Houston,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/842-1
02:58:17.402 --> 02:58:22.231
<v Josh Sparkes>you won't be able to continue for them on
that secondment. The other, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/842-2
02:58:22.231 --> 02:58:27.181
<v Josh Sparkes>no structure with that process and then
use them just thinking along those lines.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/843-0
02:58:28.981 --> 02:58:33.685
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there going to be capacity,
so there's going to be tasks that are</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/843-1
02:58:33.685 --> 02:58:37.776
<v Josh Sparkes>going to or workflows that are going to
move between teams.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/843-2
02:58:37.776 --> 02:58:42.684
<v Josh Sparkes>So obviously without when we're looking
at our joiners, movers, levers,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/843-3
02:58:42.684 --> 02:58:44.661
<v Josh Sparkes>continents for cancellations.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/844-0
02:58:46.261 --> 02:58:49.721
<v Josh Sparkes>Laura,
Laura and I both go off that weekly</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/844-1
02:58:49.721 --> 02:58:53.743
<v Josh Sparkes>report,
but if it's being triggered by ask people</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/844-2
02:58:53.743 --> 02:58:58.811
<v Josh Sparkes>and off boarding and off board PDN or or
task with ask people,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/844-3
02:58:58.811 --> 02:59:00.581
<v Josh Sparkes>can that then trigger?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/847-0
02:59:01.101 --> 02:59:05.533
<v Josh Sparkes>Something that pops into accounts payable.
So rather than us relying on that monthly</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/845-0
02:59:01.301 --> 02:59:01.781
<v Mark Sedge>Yes.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/846-0
02:59:04.261 --> 02:59:05.381
<v Mark Sedge>Yes, 100%.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/847-1
02:59:05.533 --> 02:59:08.662
<v Josh Sparkes>or the weekly report,
it could be that we might just get in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/847-2
02:59:08.662 --> 02:59:13.146
<v Josh Sparkes>like 3 individual off boardings in a week.
But we can just action them straight away.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/847-3
02:59:13.146 --> 02:59:15.596
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
And I think that's why we're saying that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/847-4
02:59:15.596 --> 02:59:19.976
<v Josh Sparkes>we'll have that wider piece of discussion
that there's lots that can come out there</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/847-5
02:59:19.976 --> 02:59:20.341
<v Josh Sparkes>in the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/850-0
02:59:20.621 --> 02:59:25.460
<v Josh Sparkes>We would believe that the dependency that
can promote those past year,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/848-0
02:59:24.061 --> 02:59:24.381
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/850-1
02:59:25.460 --> 02:59:30.845
<v Josh Sparkes>that's totally what all that right and do
Pearson PD and we just want tasks or</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/849-0
02:59:26.821 --> 02:59:27.941
<v Mark Sedge>'Cause it ultimate?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/850-2
02:59:30.845 --> 02:59:34.661
<v Josh Sparkes>where we need to and who needs to see
them. Sorry mark.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/851-0
02:59:34.461 --> 02:59:37.210
<v Mark Sedge>Yes, no,
the the whole point here is that some of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/851-1
02:59:37.210 --> 02:59:41.004
<v Mark Sedge>that off boarding etcetera,
just as it'll trigger maybe a task to IT</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/851-2
02:59:41.004 --> 02:59:44.303
<v Mark Sedge>to do some stuff,
it can trigger a task to you guys to take</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/851-3
02:59:44.303 --> 02:59:47.437
<v Mark Sedge>some actions based upon the you know that
specific user.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/851-4
02:59:47.437 --> 02:59:49.141
<v Mark Sedge>So absolutely we'd expect that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/853-0
02:59:52.701 --> 02:59:56.173
<v Josh Sparkes>Then you've got cancellations for other
reasons.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/853-1
02:59:56.173 --> 03:00:01.133
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know whether they're for
grievances or it's being taken away.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/853-2
03:00:01.133 --> 03:00:06.660
<v Josh Sparkes>Use of the card or unexpected spend.
I don't know if you have that in, Asher.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/853-3
03:00:06.660 --> 03:00:07.581
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm sure not.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/854-0
03:00:07.901 --> 03:00:13.026
<v Josh Sparkes>But I'm raising it whether for any other
reason you want to draw that card back.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/854-1
03:00:13.026 --> 03:00:14.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Does that happen?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/855-0
03:00:15.701 --> 03:00:21.005
<v Josh Sparkes>I cannot think of only one instance in
Australia and it wasn't a cancellation.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/855-1
03:00:21.005 --> 03:00:25.772
<v Josh Sparkes>We called it a suspension and holds or a
credit card wrong. Basically,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/855-2
03:00:25.772 --> 03:00:31.344
<v Josh Sparkes>the only way that we can do that with our
bank is just to reduce the limit down to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/855-3
03:00:31.344 --> 03:00:34.701
<v Josh Sparkes>like a dollar.
So they can't use it for anything.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/856-0
03:00:34.821 --> 03:00:38.661
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.
Because then it's it's technically still</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/856-1
03:00:38.661 --> 03:00:42.928
<v Josh Sparkes>active.
So when we have the authorization to then</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/856-2
03:00:42.928 --> 03:00:47.280
<v Josh Sparkes>you know,
act reactivate the card or unsuspend the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/856-3
03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:51.376
<v Josh Sparkes>card,
we just put the limit back up to a normal</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/856-4
03:00:51.376 --> 03:00:54.021
<v Josh Sparkes>limit. It just it's a lot less.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/858-0
03:00:54.381 --> 03:00:56.990
<v Josh Sparkes>And work for everyone across the board.
So,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/858-1
03:00:56.990 --> 03:01:01.673
<v Josh Sparkes>but that's the only instance that I've
ever had for a cancellation for kind of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/858-2
03:01:01.673 --> 03:01:05.941
<v Josh Sparkes>non departures. I'll find the. Yeah,
I'll be part of process even that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/859-0
03:01:08.741 --> 03:01:12.042
<v Josh Sparkes>Translation for any other reason you know
that said,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/859-1
03:01:12.042 --> 03:01:16.153
<v Josh Sparkes>overspend behavioural on an individual
and you do the same thing.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/859-2
03:01:16.153 --> 03:01:18.021
<v Josh Sparkes>You should put people down to.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/860-0
03:01:19.941 --> 03:01:21.661
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, I've been.
I don't like that first.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/861-0
03:01:27.261 --> 03:01:30.385
<v Josh Sparkes>So I I don't think so.
We have any cases like that,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/861-1
03:01:30.385 --> 03:01:33.148
<v Josh Sparkes>but you always need to track it if it
occurs.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/861-2
03:01:33.148 --> 03:01:37.534
<v Josh Sparkes>But I think the bigger question is we
should have a process and yeah for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/861-3
03:01:37.534 --> 03:01:42.340
<v Josh Sparkes>cancellation you I think that we it would
be better to have something formal on</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/861-4
03:01:42.340 --> 03:01:43.781
<v Josh Sparkes>just yeah we just don't.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/862-0
03:01:44.541 --> 03:01:47.537
<v Josh Sparkes>I haven't come across any cases where we
have had to.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/862-1
03:01:47.537 --> 03:01:50.922
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it makes it difficult,
like what are the parameters?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/862-2
03:01:50.922 --> 03:01:54.473
<v Josh Sparkes>What are the examples where you would
cancel the card? But yes,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/862-3
03:01:54.473 --> 03:01:58.634
<v Josh Sparkes>if if you agreed for a cancellation,
what is that action like comes out or</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/862-4
03:01:58.634 --> 03:02:02.851
<v Josh Sparkes>escalation out to the manager? Yeah,
of the individual, etcetera, etcetera.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/862-5
03:02:02.851 --> 03:02:03.461
<v Josh Sparkes>So I think.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/863-0
03:02:03.621 --> 03:02:11.661
<v Josh Sparkes>You don't have that in place. Nothing. No.
We can formalise that process or.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/864-0
03:02:14.421 --> 03:02:19.116
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a few actions totally also,
so let me just ask you. Sorry,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/864-1
03:02:19.116 --> 03:02:23.250
<v Josh Sparkes>that's very easy to take.
The actions I'm just explaining,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/864-2
03:02:23.250 --> 03:02:27.665
<v Josh Sparkes>we've got super abnormal.
So it's like AI that records all the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/864-3
03:02:27.665 --> 03:02:32.290
<v Josh Sparkes>lines, which is the thing, yeah,
which I can write so much of it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/864-4
03:02:32.290 --> 03:02:33.621
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm I'm doing both.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/865-0
03:02:33.701 --> 03:02:36.581
<v Josh Sparkes>It's what it was. Don't worry.
There'll be a list. Still come free.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/866-0
03:02:38.981 --> 03:02:39.981
<v Mark Sedge>At that point, so.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/867-0
03:02:39.301 --> 03:02:42.661
<v Josh Sparkes>That's microphone and then it will be
captured for action.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/869-0
03:02:43.021 --> 03:02:47.261
<v Mark Sedge>Yes, sorry, on on that one.
Some of these things is even if you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/869-1
03:02:47.261 --> 03:02:52.362
<v Mark Sedge>haven't had to execute on it year to date
is worth and I may have missed the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/869-2
03:02:52.362 --> 03:02:55.873
<v Mark Sedge>agreement,
is the decision to actually say we should</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/869-3
03:02:55.873 --> 03:02:59.781
<v Mark Sedge>have a cancellation,
a known defined cancellation process?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/873-0
03:02:58.101 --> 03:03:01.217
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I've got a follow on. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Noted that dude.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/873-1
03:03:01.217 --> 03:03:04.580
<v Josh Sparkes>Marcus SDI thing on our side.
So we'll pick that up. Yeah, I think,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/870-0
03:03:01.541 --> 03:03:01.861
<v Mark Sedge>Good.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/873-2
03:03:04.580 --> 03:03:07.547
<v Josh Sparkes>Mark, the point is,
I'm raising is that yes, we have never.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/871-0
03:03:05.221 --> 03:03:05.341
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/873-3
03:03:07.547 --> 03:03:11.157
<v Josh Sparkes>Fortunately, we never had a situation.
But what happens if there is one?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/873-4
03:03:11.157 --> 03:03:15.114
<v Josh Sparkes>Because we know that we don't have a step
by step guide for the guys, you know.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/872-0
03:03:11.541 --> 03:03:12.141
<v Mark Sedge>Correct.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/873-5
03:03:15.114 --> 03:03:17.141
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's having that supporting evidence.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/874-0
03:03:17.221 --> 03:03:20.698
<v Josh Sparkes>So again,
you know task against them and we,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/874-1
03:03:20.698 --> 03:03:24.869
<v Josh Sparkes>you know we can suggest you know the
recommendations,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/874-2
03:03:24.869 --> 03:03:31.050
<v Josh Sparkes>maybe it's a task against the managed
corporate card that's been created as sub</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/874-3
03:03:31.050 --> 03:03:35.221
<v Josh Sparkes>task which is limits you know these
scenarios limits.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/875-0
03:03:36.181 --> 03:03:40.702
<v Josh Sparkes>Credit limit to one dollar 1 lbs up to
officially counselling.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/875-1
03:03:40.702 --> 03:03:46.298
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean that might be as you said it
probably because you don't have the cases</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/875-2
03:03:46.298 --> 03:03:51.751
<v Josh Sparkes>to reflect upon that that the that you
might not want to go up to the point</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/875-3
03:03:51.751 --> 03:03:54.621
<v Josh Sparkes>where it's cancelled, it's just on hold.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/876-0
03:03:56.221 --> 03:04:01.141
<v Josh Sparkes>We do run a report that if they've got a
minimum spend or no spend on the cards,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/876-1
03:04:01.141 --> 03:04:06.001
<v Josh Sparkes>we reach out to the card holder to see if
they still need the card, and if not,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/876-2
03:04:06.001 --> 03:04:10.921
<v Josh Sparkes>then we initiate the cancellation because
they're paying for the card that's not</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/876-3
03:04:10.921 --> 03:04:13.593
<v Josh Sparkes>being used.
So they would so they could be,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/876-4
03:04:13.593 --> 03:04:14.261
<v Josh Sparkes>that's not.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/878-0
03:04:14.461 --> 03:04:18.251
<v Josh Sparkes>So the reason is why? OK,
that's the secondment process,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/877-0
03:04:16.901 --> 03:04:17.781
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/878-1
03:04:18.251 --> 03:04:23.636
<v Josh Sparkes>so they're OK to keep the card to the end
of the secondment if the date changes,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/878-2
03:04:23.636 --> 03:04:28.423
<v Josh Sparkes>we just need to update the end date if
they've reached the end of their</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/878-3
03:04:28.423 --> 03:04:34.141
<v Josh Sparkes>secondment and they want to keep the card,
they need to apply for a new card because.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/880-0
03:04:34.261 --> 03:04:38.989
<v Josh Sparkes>A national reason for the business case
and the reason that they wanted the card</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/880-1
03:04:38.989 --> 03:04:41.615
<v Josh Sparkes>and actually,
as in its appointment anymore.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/879-0
03:04:40.461 --> 03:04:40.701
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/880-2
03:04:41.615 --> 03:04:44.358
<v Josh Sparkes>So they need to fill it in your rhythmic
case.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/880-3
03:04:44.358 --> 03:04:49.144
<v Josh Sparkes>Just wanted to clarify that so that that
whole cancellation process is confusing.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/880-4
03:04:49.144 --> 03:04:50.661
<v Josh Sparkes>You've got the secondment.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/881-0
03:04:51.221 --> 03:04:56.677
<v Josh Sparkes>In there is then officializes that does
officially cancel a card and then they go</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/881-1
03:04:56.677 --> 03:05:02.199
<v Josh Sparkes>to a new application and then the process
that we talked about limiting the credit</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/881-2
03:05:02.199 --> 03:05:05.392
<v Josh Sparkes>limit and then upping it maybe and those
tasks.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/881-3
03:05:05.392 --> 03:05:10.781
<v Josh Sparkes>But if we can formalise that sort of user
story, I think we've gone quite a lot.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/882-0
03:05:10.861 --> 03:05:15.944
<v Josh Sparkes>Not there that we can suggest that that
becomes a formal process within whether</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/882-1
03:05:15.944 --> 03:05:20.264
<v Josh Sparkes>it's a sub task against the original cars
that they've applied for,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/882-2
03:05:20.264 --> 03:05:23.059
<v Josh Sparkes>we can stuff all.
It's a service in itself,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/882-3
03:05:23.059 --> 03:05:28.141
<v Josh Sparkes>but finally sort of managed corporate
cars or it's cancellation you've already.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/883-0
03:05:28.941 --> 03:05:32.762
<v Josh Sparkes>Captures. Yeah,
actually want to have a really good shout</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/883-1
03:05:32.762 --> 03:05:37.571
<v Josh Sparkes>out about our dormant balances.
So if card hasn't been used in six to 12</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/883-2
03:05:37.571 --> 03:05:40.799
<v Josh Sparkes>months,
usually it's about 12 months or it's had</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/883-3
03:05:40.799 --> 03:05:45.871
<v Josh Sparkes>minimal spend in the last 12 months,
every six months we run a report to The</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/883-4
03:05:45.871 --> 03:05:47.781
<v Josh Sparkes>Who falls into that category.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/884-0
03:05:48.341 --> 03:05:53.173
<v Josh Sparkes>And we strongly recommend that that card
is cancelled because if you haven't used</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/884-1
03:05:53.173 --> 03:05:57.062
<v Josh Sparkes>it in the last 12 months,
then obviously there's no business case</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/884-2
03:05:57.062 --> 03:06:00.597
<v Josh Sparkes>for you to keep it.
So I'd like wouldn't mind being able to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/887-0
03:06:00.581 --> 03:06:02.767
<v Mark Sedge>Yes.
So the cancellation could so the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/884-3
03:06:00.597 --> 03:06:02.541
<v Josh Sparkes>build something like the reading.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/887-1
03:06:02.767 --> 03:06:07.369
<v Mark Sedge>cancellation could be triggered either
internally via that report or externally</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/885-0
03:06:03.021 --> 03:06:03.261
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/887-2
03:06:07.369 --> 03:06:10.303
<v Mark Sedge>via some, you know,
by an HR practise or whatever.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/887-3
03:06:10.303 --> 03:06:14.789
<v Mark Sedge>But the key thing is that there's a
number of scenarios that would drive that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/887-4
03:06:14.789 --> 03:06:19.104
<v Mark Sedge>for you to recoup your, you know,
you reduce your costs basically for that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/886-0
03:06:14.821 --> 03:06:15.061
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/887-5
03:06:19.104 --> 03:06:19.621
<v Mark Sedge>for that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/888-0
03:06:19.821 --> 03:06:20.181
<v Mark Sedge>Account.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/889-0
03:06:21.861 --> 03:06:26.589
<v Josh Sparkes>I was thinking similar to the scheduled
one that you had on the backs that you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/889-1
03:06:26.589 --> 03:06:30.180
<v Josh Sparkes>could have already,
rather than you running the report with</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/889-2
03:06:30.180 --> 03:06:34.849
<v Josh Sparkes>that ask replacing that calendar event in
ServiceNow that you're running that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/889-3
03:06:34.849 --> 03:06:37.781
<v Josh Sparkes>report.
So it's a triggered from your dashboard.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/890-0
03:06:38.741 --> 03:06:42.758
<v Josh Sparkes>And then off the back of that,
you can have these cancellation processes</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/890-1
03:06:42.758 --> 03:06:45.453
<v Josh Sparkes>from there.
That's something you can do as well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/890-2
03:06:45.453 --> 03:06:49.745
<v Josh Sparkes>That sounds really good. Yeah, mark.
And we announced that that is similar to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/890-3
03:06:49.745 --> 03:06:52.881
<v Josh Sparkes>a schedule trigger of a report.
And on the back of that,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/890-4
03:06:52.881 --> 03:06:54.861
<v Josh Sparkes>the activity that comes out of that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/891-0
03:06:55.541 --> 03:06:58.696
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, for sure. Well, there's it. Yes,
it's the answer.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/891-1
03:06:58.696 --> 03:07:02.301
<v Mark Sedge>There's a number of ways of doing it,
but that will be logical.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/892-0
03:07:04.061 --> 03:07:06.499
<v Josh Sparkes>Quick quick one from me.
I don't know if it's quick,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/892-1
03:07:06.499 --> 03:07:10.041
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's question for Mark really.
Is there an opportunity for you to manage</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/892-2
03:07:10.041 --> 03:07:13.767
<v Josh Sparkes>a credit card as an asset because they're
requesting it they've been provided it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/892-3
03:07:13.767 --> 03:07:16.021
<v Josh Sparkes>and then we can have a record of in
service now.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/893-0
03:07:17.221 --> 03:07:21.921
<v Mark Sedge>There is now. There's a balance here,
right? So if if if for example,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/893-1
03:07:21.921 --> 03:07:27.023
<v Mark Sedge>you didn't have particularly user
friendly routes into the banks to be able</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/893-2
03:07:27.023 --> 03:07:30.716
<v Mark Sedge>to track who's had a card,
who's got a card, etcetera,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/893-3
03:07:30.716 --> 03:07:34.677
<v Mark Sedge>then you would consider, you know,
driving it as an asset,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/893-4
03:07:34.677 --> 03:07:36.221
<v Mark Sedge>saying that every card.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/894-0
03:07:36.621 --> 03:07:41.599
<v Mark Sedge>Unique ID on the card etcetera would
would be assigned to an individual as you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/894-1
03:07:41.599 --> 03:07:44.497
<v Mark Sedge>would any other you know,
device or whatever.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/894-2
03:07:44.497 --> 03:07:49.096
<v Mark Sedge>I think the balance here will be the
overhead to of the asset management</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/894-3
03:07:49.096 --> 03:07:54.325
<v Mark Sedge>activities versus what you'd get through
the system visibility that the teams have</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/894-4
03:07:54.325 --> 03:07:56.341
<v Mark Sedge>already. But you could track it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/897-0
03:07:56.461 --> 03:08:00.382
<v Mark Sedge>On asset I've I've seen some
organisations do that,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/897-1
03:08:00.382 --> 03:08:06.188
<v Mark Sedge>but it you know it drives additional
rigour because ultimately you'd have to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/897-2
03:08:06.188 --> 03:08:11.240
<v Mark Sedge>audit that, etcetera, etcetera.
But it is a consideration I would.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/895-0
03:08:08.541 --> 03:08:08.701
<v Josh Sparkes>Hello.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/897-3
03:08:11.240 --> 03:08:16.141
<v Mark Sedge>I would suggest that it's maybe something
we park and then just.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/896-0
03:08:16.141 --> 03:08:16.901
<v Josh Sparkes>I thought, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/898-0
03:08:16.221 --> 03:08:18.301
<v Mark Sedge>Look at whether it's required or not.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/899-0
03:08:18.901 --> 03:08:24.049
<v Josh Sparkes>I just parked it mark on the boards for
we could discuss and look at best</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/899-1
03:08:24.049 --> 03:08:25.301
<v Josh Sparkes>practise for that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/900-0
03:08:26.741 --> 03:08:27.661
<v Mark Sedge>But it's possible.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/902-0
03:08:26.741 --> 03:08:29.412
<v Parik Narain>And just to add the, I think and mark,
as I said,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/902-1
03:08:29.412 --> 03:08:33.524
<v Parik Narain>compliance is the biggest part there.
As soon as you start holding financial</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/902-2
03:08:33.524 --> 03:08:37.584
<v Parik Narain>assets in the in the in the so it's not
platform similar to health as well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/902-3
03:08:37.584 --> 03:08:41.856
<v Parik Narain>We don't try and hold this confidential
data in the platform without having the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/902-4
03:08:41.856 --> 03:08:45.221
<v Parik Narain>full rigorous you know diligence around
whether it's actually.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/905-0
03:08:45.341 --> 03:08:49.986
<v Parik Narain>Needed and whether we'll be compliant
because you can get into all sorts of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/901-0
03:08:46.141 --> 03:08:46.541
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/905-1
03:08:49.986 --> 03:08:54.752
<v Parik Narain>trouble if if we end up exposing card
numbers for some, some reason etcetera,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/904-0
03:08:53.301 --> 03:08:56.805
<v Mark Sedge>Well, you, yeah, in the UK,
it'll be the PCIPCI compliance,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/905-2
03:08:54.752 --> 03:08:58.541
<v Parik Narain>it's it's a lot of legal reasons, yeah.
Correct. Right. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/904-1
03:08:56.805 --> 03:08:58.381
<v Mark Sedge>wouldn't it? So yeah, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/906-0
03:08:59.621 --> 03:09:05.887
<v Josh Sparkes>And it's the balance of how much you
conducted compliance versus how much you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/906-1
03:09:05.887 --> 03:09:10.225
<v Josh Sparkes>can get from that.
But we can park it and they track,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/906-2
03:09:10.225 --> 03:09:14.804
<v Josh Sparkes>but that's good.
I there were two other processes that I</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/906-3
03:09:14.804 --> 03:09:19.061
<v Josh Sparkes>remember off top of my head was this
reconciliation.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/907-0
03:09:19.181 --> 03:09:25.644
<v Josh Sparkes>There seems to be wanted to understand
that and there's salary deductions on the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/907-1
03:09:25.644 --> 03:09:30.192
<v Josh Sparkes>back of it now,
so maybe we can take them hands in hands</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/907-2
03:09:30.192 --> 03:09:34.261
<v Josh Sparkes>as a reconciliation process.
Now that that's post.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/908-0
03:09:35.061 --> 03:09:38.913
<v Josh Sparkes>Are being issues.
That's like the monthly reconciliation</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/908-1
03:09:38.913 --> 03:09:42.562
<v Josh Sparkes>for the payment of our facilities.
So like, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/908-2
03:09:42.562 --> 03:09:46.818
<v Josh Sparkes>your monthly credit card bill that we
have to pay every month,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/908-3
03:09:46.818 --> 03:09:52.021
<v Josh Sparkes>then it's just making sure that it's
reconciling against in three E against.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/909-0
03:09:52.541 --> 03:09:56.937
<v Josh Sparkes>It was an activity and a reconciliation
of the monthly schedules.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/909-1
03:09:56.937 --> 03:10:00.801
<v Josh Sparkes>It might be balanced report for the
reports that you run.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/909-2
03:10:00.801 --> 03:10:06.196
<v Josh Sparkes>It's a reminder to run the reconciliation
process of credit card to three. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/909-3
03:10:06.196 --> 03:10:07.861
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'd say, I mean, look.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/910-0
03:10:08.341 --> 03:10:12.954
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a lot more to it.
There's a huge amount of work involved</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/910-1
03:10:12.954 --> 03:10:17.354
<v Josh Sparkes>for £700 in Australia.
I'm sure Australia AP does not do this</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/910-2
03:10:17.354 --> 03:10:22.251
<v Josh Sparkes>process, so don't worry about me,
that's that's looking happy. Well,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/910-3
03:10:22.251 --> 03:10:27.715
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm happy to mention it but yeah,
so you don't do that process in Australia,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/910-4
03:10:27.715 --> 03:10:28.141
<v Josh Sparkes>we do.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/911-0
03:10:28.261 --> 03:10:32.356
<v Josh Sparkes>But it doesn't have AP,
it's it's with a financial management</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/911-1
03:10:32.356 --> 03:10:33.941
<v Josh Sparkes>team non a non ask team.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/912-0
03:10:35.621 --> 03:10:40.636
<v Josh Sparkes>When we had that question today,
or would you because UK is doing it,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/912-1
03:10:40.636 --> 03:10:45.435
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm not or UK does it? Yeah,
would you want it in the future to be</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/912-2
03:10:45.435 --> 03:10:48.587
<v Josh Sparkes>part of AP,
the credit card reconciliation?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/912-3
03:10:48.587 --> 03:10:53.602
<v Josh Sparkes>No idea what I need to look.
A process is effective rather than being</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/912-4
03:10:53.602 --> 03:10:54.461
<v Josh Sparkes>assigned to.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/913-0
03:10:56.021 --> 03:10:59.818
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm very happy for the other team to be
managing in Australia,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/913-1
03:10:59.818 --> 03:11:04.699
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's on here because the UK do it.
The AP do it themselves and the challenge</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/913-2
03:11:04.699 --> 03:11:07.953
<v Josh Sparkes>was should AP Australia be doing it.
But as you said,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/913-3
03:11:07.953 --> 03:11:09.821
<v Josh Sparkes>if you're happy that it's more.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/915-0
03:11:10.741 --> 03:11:14.243
<v Josh Sparkes>The process level,
whether it should be handled in if we're</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/915-1
03:11:14.243 --> 03:11:17.861
<v Josh Sparkes>looking at globalised processes,
whether it falls under that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/918-0
03:11:19.701 --> 03:11:20.421
Play song.

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/919-0
03:11:20.501 --> 03:11:24.632
<v Mark Sedge>And that might be a question for the
target operating model in terms of where,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/916-0
03:11:20.581 --> 03:11:20.701
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/919-1
03:11:24.632 --> 03:11:27.926
<v Mark Sedge>where is it best and most efficiently
done is there, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/917-0
03:11:26.701 --> 03:11:26.941
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/919-2
03:11:27.926 --> 03:11:32.213
<v Mark Sedge>is there better synergies for one group
to do it or the other that's a different,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/919-3
03:11:32.213 --> 03:11:35.088
<v Mark Sedge>different debate.
But as long as from our perspective,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/919-4
03:11:35.088 --> 03:11:39.062
<v Mark Sedge>if we've got a mechanism to catch the
task so that the start and end of the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/919-5
03:11:39.062 --> 03:11:40.421
<v Mark Sedge>task can be gathered that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/920-0
03:11:40.501 --> 03:11:44.941
<v Mark Sedge>They was the demand consumption to be at
least calculated or understood.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/921-0
03:11:45.741 --> 03:11:48.129
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
and these these processes are scalable.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/921-1
03:11:48.129 --> 03:11:52.282
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's not like we built it for the UK.
So it's the fact that you can build it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/921-2
03:11:52.282 --> 03:11:55.448
<v Josh Sparkes>and if they were A and other comes, yeah,
that's for the US,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/921-3
03:11:55.448 --> 03:11:59.756
<v Josh Sparkes>won't be involved in their reconciliation
differently. It's just a scalable model,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/921-4
03:11:59.756 --> 03:12:03.701
<v Josh Sparkes>but you're using the same workflow.
Sorry Jill, I didn't need to interrupt.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/922-0
03:12:04.701 --> 03:12:08.183
<v Josh Sparkes>It's all right. You weren't interrupted.
I was just thinking there.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/922-1
03:12:08.183 --> 03:12:10.640
<v Josh Sparkes>I wonder as well if it's something that
we can.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/922-2
03:12:10.640 --> 03:12:14.224
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't know if it's part of our service
design work that's going on.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/922-3
03:12:14.224 --> 03:12:17.143
<v Josh Sparkes>And at the moment,
Lauren's just checking for me because</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/922-4
03:12:17.143 --> 03:12:21.341
<v Josh Sparkes>that's where we're obviously simplifying
after the service catalogue was created.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/923-0
03:12:21.701 --> 03:12:25.537
<v Josh Sparkes>We've prioritised what work we're doing
to find out where that sits as well.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/923-1
03:12:25.537 --> 03:12:27.181
<v Josh Sparkes>So OK, so I'm going to figure 94.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/924-0
03:12:30.501 --> 03:12:35.149
<v Josh Sparkes>The UK process that,
that's a triggered reminder rather than</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/924-1
03:12:35.149 --> 03:12:40.331
<v Josh Sparkes>the past itself within, yeah,
because for Amex I believe our direct</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/924-2
03:12:40.331 --> 03:12:45.741
<v Josh Sparkes>debit for the payment of the cards comes
out on the 24th of the month.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/925-0
03:12:46.301 --> 03:12:50.741
<v Josh Sparkes>So we need to make sure that we've
reconciled it so that when the payment</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/925-1
03:12:50.741 --> 03:12:54.401
<v Josh Sparkes>comes out the bank,
we've got all the information we need to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/925-2
03:12:54.401 --> 03:12:57.881
<v Josh Sparkes>clear down that payment,
so that then it doesn't become a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/925-3
03:12:57.881 --> 03:13:02.081
<v Josh Sparkes>reconciling item on the bank.
So it's just a scheduled request, yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/925-4
03:13:02.081 --> 03:13:02.741
<v Josh Sparkes>to prevent.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/926-0
03:13:04.381 --> 03:13:08.120
<v Josh Sparkes>Any activities?
So you've reconciled check balances all</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/926-1
03:13:08.120 --> 03:13:11.926
<v Josh Sparkes>matches. Yeah,
because in all the transactions for Amex,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/926-2
03:13:11.926 --> 03:13:17.534
<v Josh Sparkes>our own aim and bunch or expense platform.
So we are relying on the business having</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/926-3
03:13:17.534 --> 03:13:22.541
<v Josh Sparkes>done their part and being that Amex
support and getting it through timely.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/927-0
03:13:22.901 --> 03:13:25.640
<v Josh Sparkes>And so that when the payment comes out,
the bank,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/927-1
03:13:25.640 --> 03:13:29.694
<v Josh Sparkes>we can then match it down after any
reason that someone's not submitted a</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/927-2
03:13:29.694 --> 03:13:32.269
<v Josh Sparkes>report,
they really need to make the necessary</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/927-3
03:13:32.269 --> 03:13:35.446
<v Josh Sparkes>adjustments so that we can then clear the
bank item down.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/927-4
03:13:35.446 --> 03:13:39.061
<v Josh Sparkes>So it sounds like a scheduled task that
you have like a bit like.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/928-0
03:13:39.661 --> 03:13:43.086
<v Josh Sparkes>We've had we get the recommendation for
anything.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/928-1
03:13:43.086 --> 03:13:48.292
<v Josh Sparkes>There's like a calendar of events.
We'll model it with standards service on</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/928-2
03:13:48.292 --> 03:13:53.155
<v Josh Sparkes>that. But would you want so for example,
that suggests the happy part,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/928-3
03:13:53.155 --> 03:13:55.621
<v Josh Sparkes>but I'm reminded I do it, it's done.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/929-0
03:13:56.021 --> 03:14:00.181
<v Josh Sparkes>But would there be root causes for the
reasons why?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/930-0
03:14:01.501 --> 03:14:04.430
<v Josh Sparkes>There's some errors.
Do you capture or do you do that?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/930-1
03:14:04.430 --> 03:14:08.316
<v Josh Sparkes>Once you're doing that reconciliation,
let's assume that you're actually</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/930-2
03:14:08.316 --> 03:14:11.404
<v Josh Sparkes>reconciling it.
It's all done and you can just close that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/930-3
03:14:11.404 --> 03:14:14.918
<v Josh Sparkes>or on the back of that monthly you've
done, it's been reconciled.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/930-4
03:14:14.918 --> 03:14:17.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there any post activity that comes in?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/931-0
03:14:17.781 --> 03:14:22.590
<v Josh Sparkes>Generally that you then have to address
just if we've made any adjustments to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/931-1
03:14:22.590 --> 03:14:26.659
<v Josh Sparkes>clear it down within metering one and
reverse them so that, yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/931-2
03:14:26.659 --> 03:14:31.222
<v Josh Sparkes>and I wonder whether that could capture
within that path the adjustments.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/931-3
03:14:31.222 --> 03:14:34.181
<v Josh Sparkes>So post doing that reconciliation you
captured.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/932-0
03:14:34.501 --> 03:14:39.584
<v Josh Sparkes>You know, future reporting, you know,
last month this this activity we have to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/932-1
03:14:39.584 --> 03:14:44.859
<v Josh Sparkes>redo this activity we did so that you're
always reporting on it and then you over</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/932-2
03:14:44.859 --> 03:14:50.135
<v Josh Sparkes>time you get those insights actually the
next month's task is within error and it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/932-3
03:14:50.135 --> 03:14:51.421
<v Josh Sparkes>stops those repeats.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/933-0
03:14:52.101 --> 03:14:56.622
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah. Would that be useful to have?
It'd be useful if everybody brought their</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/933-1
03:14:56.622 --> 03:14:59.752
<v Josh Sparkes>reports through and everything. I'm OK.
Yeah. I mean,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/933-2
03:14:59.752 --> 03:15:03.868
<v Josh Sparkes>that could be a check of reports weren't
submitted in a timely manner,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/933-3
03:15:03.868 --> 03:15:07.461
<v Josh Sparkes>and then that becomes the insight of
changing your behaviour.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/934-0
03:15:07.821 --> 03:15:09.621
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, that's all for you too, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/936-0
03:15:08.541 --> 03:15:08.661
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/937-0
03:15:08.741 --> 03:15:12.641
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, you'd you'd expect.
You'd expect you to be able to use that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/937-1
03:15:12.641 --> 03:15:16.777
<v Mark Sedge>fact based KPI to then drive that game
back into the leadership team,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/935-0
03:15:14.301 --> 03:15:14.421
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/937-2
03:15:16.777 --> 03:15:21.445
<v Mark Sedge>up the line to CID etcetera to start
communicating that across say This is why</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/937-3
03:15:21.445 --> 03:15:25.581
<v Mark Sedge>it's important guys you know,
because it costs us from an operational</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/937-4
03:15:25.581 --> 03:15:28.181
<v Mark Sedge>perspective X amount or X amount of
effort.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/938-0
03:15:28.981 --> 03:15:30.421
<v Mark Sedge>Because it's just failure demand.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/939-0
03:15:31.861 --> 03:15:32.061
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/940-0
03:15:34.581 --> 03:15:39.041
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's and then one one thing
I'll come from is on the US as well,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/940-1
03:15:39.041 --> 03:15:43.797
<v Josh Sparkes>whether we will run the reconciliation of
US or not because of the of USI think</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/940-2
03:15:43.797 --> 03:15:48.792
<v Josh Sparkes>that's probably a conversation across the
umbrella rule part is that a very sort of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/940-3
03:15:48.792 --> 03:15:52.181
<v Josh Sparkes>progress only been interesting piece to
discuss is Nick.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/941-0
03:15:53.301 --> 03:15:58.054
<v Josh Sparkes>Reporting to the same person and then
whether they want to take it or not.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/941-1
03:15:58.054 --> 03:15:58.941
<v Josh Sparkes>But let's see.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/942-0
03:16:02.861 --> 03:16:05.860
<v Josh Sparkes>Australia's taking back the
reconciliation process.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/942-1
03:16:05.860 --> 03:16:10.071
<v Josh Sparkes>It's exactly the same as what the UK goes
through anyway. We what? Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/942-2
03:16:10.071 --> 03:16:13.589
<v Josh Sparkes>one of us all. Yeah.
What has done offline here was, I mean,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/942-3
03:16:13.589 --> 03:16:16.299
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah,
the only difference is the source of our</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/942-4
03:16:16.299 --> 03:16:18.952
<v Josh Sparkes>bank statements because it's different
banks,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/942-5
03:16:18.952 --> 03:16:22.701
<v Josh Sparkes>but we have to cross check it against the
same data or you know.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/943-0
03:16:23.181 --> 03:16:25.399
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
data from the same expense management</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/943-1
03:16:25.399 --> 03:16:28.826
<v Josh Sparkes>programme put it into 3 E make the
adjustments to match the debits,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/943-2
03:16:28.826 --> 03:16:32.807
<v Josh Sparkes>our debits come out about the 28th of the
month. So it's really similar. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/943-3
03:16:32.807 --> 03:16:36.738
<v Josh Sparkes>it was just handled by people. Things.
Yeah, for now. And does that probably.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/943-4
03:16:36.738 --> 03:16:39.661
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, I'll say that.
Does it still want to be captured?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/944-0
03:16:40.301 --> 03:16:45.067
<v Josh Sparkes>You know we can assign it to a group
that's then captured, so it might not.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/944-1
03:16:45.067 --> 03:16:49.269
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean, we're in AP today,
but it could be that that process still</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/944-2
03:16:49.269 --> 03:16:52.593
<v Josh Sparkes>is captured,
formalised and they get open fights for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/944-3
03:16:52.593 --> 03:16:55.101
<v Josh Sparkes>learning any behavioural change from it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/945-0
03:16:55.581 --> 03:16:58.427
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
Can you remind me of the team that does</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/945-1
03:16:58.427 --> 03:17:02.881
<v Josh Sparkes>financial management team? Well,
I think you as a group look, it's all,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/945-2
03:17:02.881 --> 03:17:05.665
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah,
we had to clarify financial management</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/945-3
03:17:05.665 --> 03:17:09.129
<v Josh Sparkes>points on here. Yeah, yeah.
So it is decisions, but OK,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/945-4
03:17:09.129 --> 03:17:10.861
<v Josh Sparkes>we call ourselves financial.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/946-0
03:17:13.661 --> 03:17:15.261
<v Josh Sparkes>Technically they are.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/947-0
03:17:19.461 --> 03:17:23.801
<v Josh Sparkes>They managed to all the accounts,
corporate accounts and everything.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/947-1
03:17:23.801 --> 03:17:28.582
<v Josh Sparkes>They have fuel accounting team here,
but then what accounting is it called?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/947-2
03:17:28.582 --> 03:17:32.670
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you should be called big man or
finance management team.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/947-3
03:17:32.670 --> 03:17:36.821
<v Josh Sparkes>I think that's what I thought.
I think it's financial management.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/948-0
03:17:37.381 --> 03:17:37.501
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/949-0
03:17:39.861 --> 03:17:44.178
<v Josh Sparkes>Financial these guys,
these guys right now for the yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/949-1
03:17:44.178 --> 03:17:48.494
<v Josh Sparkes>sure there was.
I think he commented on they were called</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/949-2
03:17:48.494 --> 03:17:51.978
<v Josh Sparkes>financial management. Yeah,
they're the ones.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/949-3
03:17:51.978 --> 03:17:57.581
<v Josh Sparkes>But they like comment that I put in
through all like the worksheet stuff.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/950-0
03:17:58.021 --> 03:18:02.392
<v Josh Sparkes>Early on and we wanted to clarify you
financially, it's not getting asked.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/950-1
03:18:02.392 --> 03:18:05.597
<v Josh Sparkes>It's once they didn't ask. Yeah.
And I just got right,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/950-2
03:18:05.597 --> 03:18:09.910
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's potentially could be a sign that
similar path that you're doing,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/950-3
03:18:09.910 --> 03:18:11.541
<v Josh Sparkes>but to capture those invite.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/951-0
03:18:13.741 --> 03:18:13.861
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/952-0
03:18:15.261 --> 03:18:15.381
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/953-0
03:18:19.101 --> 03:18:23.758
<v Josh Sparkes>Good.
I think that is that workflow of credit</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/953-1
03:18:23.758 --> 03:18:30.440
<v Josh Sparkes>cards for the new application,
localization reconciliation salary</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/953-2
03:18:30.440 --> 03:18:33.781
<v Josh Sparkes>deduction off the top of my head.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/954-0
03:18:34.141 --> 03:18:35.661
<v Josh Sparkes>There was a process for.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/955-0
03:18:37.661 --> 03:18:42.267
<v Josh Sparkes>Now is that on the basis of that,
they spent items on their corporate card</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/955-1
03:18:42.267 --> 03:18:47.057
<v Josh Sparkes>that are deemed personal even though they
use their card for whatever reason,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/955-2
03:18:47.057 --> 03:18:50.618
<v Josh Sparkes>their card will be accepted,
they're in the jurisdiction,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/955-3
03:18:50.618 --> 03:18:54.794
<v Josh Sparkes>but whatever it might be.
But then from that reconciliation process</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/955-4
03:18:54.794 --> 03:18:55.101
<v Josh Sparkes>then.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/956-0
03:18:55.381 --> 03:19:00.705
<v Josh Sparkes>Triggering a family deduction because all
they can be separate.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/956-1
03:19:00.705 --> 03:19:07.526
<v Josh Sparkes>Can they the deduction process separate
to the monthly reconciliation process and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/956-2
03:19:07.526 --> 03:19:14.181
<v Josh Sparkes>it's triggered by when local payroll is
processed because the report that both.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/957-0
03:19:14.541 --> 03:19:20.902
<v Josh Sparkes>UK and Australia run is sent to local
payroll and the payroll team actually</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/957-1
03:19:20.902 --> 03:19:27.597
<v Josh Sparkes>process the deduction from the salaries
we just give them the information to do</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/957-2
03:19:27.597 --> 03:19:31.781
<v Josh Sparkes>so. OK, so it's a task,
it's a task that you run.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/958-0
03:19:33.181 --> 03:19:39.100
<v Josh Sparkes>Monthly or UK don't do it monthly. Yeah,
Australia do it fortnightly. OK. And that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/958-1
03:19:39.100 --> 03:19:43.609
<v Josh Sparkes>And what's your report that you're
running against? What? What?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/958-2
03:19:43.609 --> 03:19:47.907
<v Josh Sparkes>You're that you're using?
So the process starts with someone</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/958-3
03:19:47.907 --> 03:19:48.541
<v Josh Sparkes>spending.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/959-0
03:19:48.901 --> 03:19:53.817
<v Josh Sparkes>Like getting an Uber on their corporate
card? At least that we all our expense.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/959-1
03:19:53.817 --> 03:19:58.240
<v Josh Sparkes>Will we see it through the coding in our
expense management system? OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/959-2
03:19:58.240 --> 03:20:03.402
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's kind of the first point that we
might see. You can see that something is,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/959-3
03:20:03.402 --> 03:20:06.289
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah,
someone's going to allocate that expense</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/959-4
03:20:06.289 --> 03:20:08.501
<v Josh Sparkes>to my personal spend on a corporate.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/960-0
03:20:08.541 --> 03:20:12.982
<v Josh Sparkes>Card code and so on.
A fortnightly in Australia or monthly in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/960-1
03:20:12.982 --> 03:20:18.783
<v Josh Sparkes>the UK whenever we need, when we need to,
we will run a general Ledger report on</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/960-2
03:20:18.783 --> 03:20:24.512
<v Josh Sparkes>that personal spend general Ledger code
out of three E directly because all the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/960-3
03:20:24.512 --> 03:20:28.021
<v Josh Sparkes>information from our expense manager and
system.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/961-0
03:20:28.181 --> 03:20:31.473
<v Josh Sparkes>Into 3A,
so it's easier for us to extract that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/961-1
03:20:31.473 --> 03:20:36.866
<v Josh Sparkes>specific code. Reports against that,
have they? Yes, that's all spends. Yes.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/961-2
03:20:36.866 --> 03:20:40.508
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. So it has to be marked against that.
OK. Sorry.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/961-3
03:20:40.508 --> 03:20:46.251
<v Josh Sparkes>So we'll run the report to extract that
information off that specific code out of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/961-4
03:20:46.251 --> 03:20:46.461
<v Josh Sparkes>3A.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/962-0
03:20:46.821 --> 03:20:50.546
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we cleared it,
send it off to payroll and say these are</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/962-1
03:20:50.546 --> 03:20:53.181
<v Josh Sparkes>the people that need their salary
deductions.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/963-0
03:20:56.021 --> 03:21:00.271
<v Josh Sparkes>You do it. It's still a talk.
That means that we capture so again</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/963-1
03:21:00.271 --> 03:21:05.421
<v Josh Sparkes>similar to the following of the reports
for reconciliation, we can run it as a.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/964-0
03:21:05.581 --> 03:21:05.701
<v Josh Sparkes>And.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/966-0
03:21:07.541 --> 03:21:12.868
<v Josh Sparkes>Port type activity,
the fortnightly yours is once a month.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/966-1
03:21:12.868 --> 03:21:13.861
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/967-0
03:21:15.781 --> 03:21:20.654
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, it's the same process.
It's different frequencies because it's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/967-1
03:21:20.654 --> 03:21:26.233
<v Josh Sparkes>dependent on when payroll is run. Yeah.
OK. And that sounds like a happy part.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/967-2
03:21:26.233 --> 03:21:30.894
<v Josh Sparkes>It's captures given to payroll.
Do you want to capture that task?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/967-3
03:21:30.894 --> 03:21:31.741
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's new.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/968-0
03:21:32.141 --> 03:21:37.321
<v Josh Sparkes>Even to payroll closed with no payroll,
don't come back with any further</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/968-1
03:21:37.321 --> 03:21:41.863
<v Josh Sparkes>questions, no questions asked of. Yeah,
yeah. No rejection. No.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/968-2
03:21:41.863 --> 03:21:46.901
<v Josh Sparkes>And do you ever find anything?
So that's been marked on the Ledger as.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/969-0
03:21:47.061 --> 03:21:50.808
<v Josh Sparkes>Personal spend.
You also find them proactively like that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/969-1
03:21:50.808 --> 03:21:54.095
<v Josh Sparkes>looks unusual,
even though they've said it's open</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/969-2
03:21:54.095 --> 03:21:58.828
<v Josh Sparkes>Spanish. Actually, personal then,
and then you follow that same process</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/969-3
03:21:58.828 --> 03:22:03.824
<v Josh Sparkes>where you mark it or rectify in the
expense tracker if well in that example</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/969-4
03:22:03.824 --> 03:22:05.861
<v Josh Sparkes>if you see transaction that is.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/970-0
03:22:06.141 --> 03:22:09.758
<v Josh Sparkes>Coded to a normal expense code,
but you think it might be personal.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/970-1
03:22:09.758 --> 03:22:13.907
<v Josh Sparkes>You would never pick that up like we
would never call that out because that's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/970-2
03:22:13.907 --> 03:22:18.109
<v Josh Sparkes>not really our place that they pay that
it would be more reliant on the budget</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/970-3
03:22:18.109 --> 03:22:20.502
<v Josh Sparkes>holder to kind of pick that up and say,
hey,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/970-4
03:22:20.502 --> 03:22:24.491
<v Josh Sparkes>I actually don't know it was so much a
happy part based on a report. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/970-5
03:22:24.491 --> 03:22:25.661
<v Josh Sparkes>it literally whatever.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/971-0
03:22:25.781 --> 03:22:31.083
<v Josh Sparkes>Is processed as our personal spend on
corporate card code is what we provide</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/971-1
03:22:31.083 --> 03:22:34.456
<v Josh Sparkes>payroll.
It's kind of no questions asked because</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/971-2
03:22:34.456 --> 03:22:39.964
<v Josh Sparkes>it's not our place to decide on someone
else's behalf what should or should not</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/971-3
03:22:39.964 --> 03:22:41.341
<v Josh Sparkes>be a personal spend.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/972-0
03:22:42.261 --> 03:22:43.861
<v Josh Sparkes>No. Simple. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/973-0
03:22:46.341 --> 03:22:49.941
<v Josh Sparkes>We do check errors,
but because sometimes have coded it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/973-1
03:22:49.941 --> 03:22:53.348
<v Josh Sparkes>incorrectly,
so when we're doing the reconciliation,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/973-2
03:22:53.348 --> 03:22:58.233
<v Josh Sparkes>if usually they always write personal
expense. So you know that that's one,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/973-3
03:22:58.233 --> 03:23:03.247
<v Josh Sparkes>but one that maybe they haven't wrote
that that could be a wee bit suspicious</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/973-4
03:23:03.247 --> 03:23:04.661
<v Josh Sparkes>if it is a high value.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/974-0
03:23:05.141 --> 03:23:09.521
<v Josh Sparkes>We would push it back and ask them listen,
you've put that straight to this codes,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/974-1
03:23:09.521 --> 03:23:12.741
<v Josh Sparkes>is that correct? Before we do it,
if it's only a few pounds,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/974-2
03:23:12.741 --> 03:23:16.751
<v Josh Sparkes>like we don't scrutinise everything.
There is also partners as well because</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/974-3
03:23:16.751 --> 03:23:20.657
<v Josh Sparkes>partners should be coming out of a
different they shouldn't be getting it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/974-4
03:23:20.657 --> 03:23:23.981
<v Josh Sparkes>taken out of a salary.
So we have to make amendments for that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/975-0
03:23:25.061 --> 03:23:28.068
<v Josh Sparkes>Those don't.
They don't have a deduction process,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/975-1
03:23:28.068 --> 03:23:31.978
<v Josh Sparkes>full salary. They've got a statement.
The partners are separate.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/975-2
03:23:31.978 --> 03:23:36.729
<v Josh Sparkes>They've got a different different codes
that they use, but they still haven't.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/975-3
03:23:36.729 --> 03:23:40.879
<v Josh Sparkes>That's putting it through that.
Don't don't realise that there's two</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/975-4
03:23:40.879 --> 03:23:41.781
<v Josh Sparkes>separate codes.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/976-0
03:23:42.381 --> 03:23:46.723
<v Josh Sparkes>I was saying I was just different code,
but there's still deduction process is</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/976-1
03:23:46.723 --> 03:23:50.296
<v Josh Sparkes>still the same. Yeah. Yeah.
Still going to be deducted for their</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/976-2
03:23:50.296 --> 03:23:53.978
<v Josh Sparkes>personal spend. OK. Yeah.
The partners deductions just don't go to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/976-3
03:23:53.978 --> 03:23:56.781
<v Josh Sparkes>payroll.
There's a separate process for that, but.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/977-0
03:23:57.661 --> 03:24:02.187
<v Josh Sparkes>It's just making sure that the right code
for a partner versus non partner is</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/977-1
03:24:02.187 --> 03:24:05.203
<v Josh Sparkes>selected,
so just going back to picking up for that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/977-2
03:24:05.203 --> 03:24:08.046
<v Josh Sparkes>part of your reconciliation process that
you do.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/977-3
03:24:08.046 --> 03:24:11.701
<v Josh Sparkes>So I'm wondering if the salary deduction
is a sub task of the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/978-0
03:24:12.941 --> 03:24:16.113
<v Josh Sparkes>Reconciliation process,
rather than separate,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/978-1
03:24:16.113 --> 03:24:21.768
<v Josh Sparkes>it's separate for Australia because we I
would do it on a fortnightly basis where</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/978-2
03:24:21.768 --> 03:24:27.147
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean we would only be running the
reconciliation when it's triggered by the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/978-3
03:24:27.147 --> 03:24:30.181
<v Josh Sparkes>monthly debit out of our bank account
this.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/979-0
03:24:30.661 --> 03:24:35.856
<v Josh Sparkes>The deductions process is triggered by
when payroll is being processed,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/979-1
03:24:35.856 --> 03:24:40.618
<v Josh Sparkes>so it's two very separate. Yeah,
like one is looking at just bank</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/979-2
03:24:40.618 --> 03:24:45.812
<v Josh Sparkes>statements and transactions spent.
The other one is looking at specific</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/979-3
03:24:45.812 --> 03:24:50.141
<v Josh Sparkes>codes. OK. So we can keep them.
You can keep them separate.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/980-0
03:24:50.581 --> 03:24:51.501
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah, makes sense.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/981-0
03:24:54.501 --> 03:24:58.313
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, that's good. That's clear.
It's the happy path. As you say,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/981-1
03:24:58.313 --> 03:25:02.126
<v Josh Sparkes>there wasn't a rejection,
that's all been done and I think it's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/981-2
03:25:02.126 --> 03:25:05.461
<v Josh Sparkes>introduction process.
I think we've covered everything.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/982-0
03:25:08.261 --> 03:25:11.800
<v Josh Sparkes>Cancellations,
application relations expenses,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/982-1
03:25:11.800 --> 03:25:15.941
<v Josh Sparkes>Application UK,
American Express application you don't</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/982-2
03:25:15.941 --> 03:25:21.212
<v Josh Sparkes>think that's it? Yeah. I mean,
it's triggered looking at the expenses</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/982-3
03:25:21.212 --> 03:25:24.901
<v Josh Sparkes>and I think you've mentioned what you
doing but.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/983-0
03:25:25.261 --> 03:25:27.900
<v Josh Sparkes>Actually,
maybe it's become part of an expense</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/983-1
03:25:27.900 --> 03:25:31.942
<v Josh Sparkes>process and then reversing that on's head
if there's a lot of expenses,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/983-2
03:25:31.942 --> 03:25:35.422
<v Josh Sparkes>but someone's submitting when we get to
the expense theories.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/983-3
03:25:35.422 --> 03:25:39.071
<v Josh Sparkes>If you turn that head,
actually you should have a corporate cast</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/983-4
03:25:39.071 --> 03:25:42.103
<v Josh Sparkes>that will be the reverse of what you're
saying to me,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/983-5
03:25:42.103 --> 03:25:44.741
<v Josh Sparkes>that if you're spending so low to through
the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/984-0
03:25:45.141 --> 03:25:49.976
<v Josh Sparkes>The process that actually can expense is
really high and my problem triggers doing</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/984-1
03:25:49.976 --> 03:25:53.355
<v Josh Sparkes>the expense theories that we get to that
we turn that on.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/984-2
03:25:53.355 --> 03:25:56.443
<v Josh Sparkes>We said that they should be applying for
public car.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/984-3
03:25:56.443 --> 03:26:00.812
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe that's I don't think that's the
case is the reverse of corporate car</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/984-4
03:26:00.812 --> 03:26:02.501
<v Josh Sparkes>through expenses or expenses.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/985-0
03:26:02.781 --> 03:26:06.986
<v Josh Sparkes>The corporate card. Yeah.
And then I think there's been one example</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/985-1
03:26:06.986 --> 03:26:11.810
<v Josh Sparkes>in Australia recently that that's been
the case where someone's PE and myself</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/985-2
03:26:11.810 --> 03:26:16.263
<v Josh Sparkes>have both said, look, travelling,
it probably is worth having corporate</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/985-3
03:26:16.263 --> 03:26:21.148
<v Josh Sparkes>card because you're going travelling
quite frequently and the person just said</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/985-4
03:26:21.148 --> 03:26:22.261
<v Josh Sparkes>no, no, it's fine.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/986-0
03:26:22.581 --> 03:26:26.368
<v Josh Sparkes>I'd rather get the points on my credit
card and just get reimbursed. So OK, yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/986-1
03:26:26.368 --> 03:26:29.232
<v Josh Sparkes>OK, you know that one?
Can I ask what the difference has been</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/986-2
03:26:29.232 --> 03:26:32.141
<v Josh Sparkes>the expense process you're running,
the one that we earn runs.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/987-0
03:26:40.061 --> 03:26:40.781
<v Josh Sparkes>We.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/988-0
03:26:43.381 --> 03:26:48.760
<v Josh Sparkes>You need Rhiannon and Abu Rhiannon. Yeah.
That's why it was funny. So, no,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/988-1
03:26:48.760 --> 03:26:53.851
<v Josh Sparkes>she was Rhiannon expensive. So yeah.
So Rhiannon codes and submits the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/988-2
03:26:53.851 --> 03:26:58.656
<v Josh Sparkes>expenses at the front end.
We audit and review the expenses at the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/988-3
03:26:58.656 --> 03:26:59.301
<v Josh Sparkes>back end.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/989-0
03:27:00.301 --> 03:27:05.056
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like a pre and a post. Yeah. Yeah.
Recipient of. Yes. For the. So, yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/989-1
03:27:05.056 --> 03:27:08.653
<v Josh Sparkes>same programme.
But just different functions. Yeah. Of it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/989-2
03:27:08.653 --> 03:27:13.225
<v Josh Sparkes>She's first part of the instead of the
partner or the P they just send the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/989-3
03:27:13.225 --> 03:27:16.821
<v Josh Sparkes>information to the addon and then it
wants to association.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/990-0
03:27:19.021 --> 03:27:19.141
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/991-0
03:27:21.221 --> 03:27:24.301
<v Josh Sparkes>I think definitely call it break for
their for lunch. Yeah, perfect timing.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/992-0
03:27:27.181 --> 03:27:30.461
<v Josh Sparkes>Say in a sense that we have looked at.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/993-0
03:27:35.261 --> 03:27:40.124
<v Josh Sparkes>The manager in the vendor,
which will be part of the manage invoice</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/993-1
03:27:40.124 --> 03:27:45.344
<v Josh Sparkes>process. Oh yeah. Sorry. Yeah.
Look at the comfort cards and then we can</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/993-2
03:27:45.344 --> 03:27:48.705
<v Josh Sparkes>take a quick lunch break, please.
In the army.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/993-3
03:27:48.705 --> 03:27:52.781
<v Josh Sparkes>So do we still have any sort of cards
process to review?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/994-0
03:27:54.021 --> 03:27:56.353
<v Josh Sparkes>Cards.
We have invoices coming up payments,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/994-1
03:27:56.353 --> 03:28:00.221
<v Josh Sparkes>so no cards, right. Yeah. Cards done.
Mm-hmm. What would the cash cards.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/995-0
03:28:04.741 --> 03:28:10.533
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've got apartment cards and that we
use and we also have cash cards.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/995-1
03:28:10.533 --> 03:28:16.559
<v Josh Sparkes>So the cash cards are for employees that
are doing sister office travelling.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/995-2
03:28:16.559 --> 03:28:22.741
<v Josh Sparkes>So we are they might be going in there,
maybe going down to London for a week.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/996-0
03:28:23.461 --> 03:28:28.861
<v Josh Sparkes>Rather than them taking their own card
using the money out of their own account,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/996-1
03:28:28.861 --> 03:28:33.328
<v Josh Sparkes>basically we give them a corporate card
so that they can use that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/996-2
03:28:33.328 --> 03:28:38.728
<v Josh Sparkes>So we've got the reconciliation for that
and the each department in self or some</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/996-3
03:28:38.728 --> 03:28:42.261
<v Josh Sparkes>department not each of them,
we've all about paying.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/997-0
03:28:43.061 --> 03:28:47.632
<v Josh Sparkes>That and off the top of my head,
and they have got an NatWest credit card</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/997-1
03:28:47.632 --> 03:28:50.473
<v Josh Sparkes>where,
like operations teams and events teams</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/997-2
03:28:50.473 --> 03:28:55.476
<v Josh Sparkes>where they maybe need to order something
there and then you can have a statement</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/997-3
03:28:55.476 --> 03:28:58.626
<v Josh Sparkes>for that as well.
It's a green thing about what we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/997-4
03:28:58.626 --> 03:28:59.861
<v Josh Sparkes>discussed today too.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/998-0
03:29:00.461 --> 03:29:05.014
<v Josh Sparkes>We're all boarding that card.
So you've applied for from the beginning,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/998-1
03:29:05.014 --> 03:29:08.681
<v Josh Sparkes>applies for department cards,
that has to be applied for.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/998-2
03:29:08.681 --> 03:29:13.423
<v Josh Sparkes>So what sort of process is that?
So they get assigned to somebody is going</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/998-3
03:29:13.423 --> 03:29:17.216
<v Josh Sparkes>to name person under that.
That I believe is dealt with the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/998-4
03:29:17.216 --> 03:29:20.061
<v Josh Sparkes>procurement team just say Ross Paul
candles.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/999-0
03:29:20.261 --> 03:29:24.591
<v Josh Sparkes>That part of it.
So I'm not sure how he deals with that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/999-1
03:29:24.591 --> 03:29:28.390
<v Josh Sparkes>We just do the reconciliation of the
account, OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/999-2
03:29:28.390 --> 03:29:31.732
<v Josh Sparkes>So they so department cards and cash
cards,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/999-3
03:29:31.732 --> 03:29:37.506
<v Josh Sparkes>cash cards raising that is a process that
you don't you don't do that part.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/999-4
03:29:37.506 --> 03:29:39.101
<v Josh Sparkes>The cash cards we do.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1000-0
03:29:41.141 --> 03:29:45.162
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
the Rose ball kind of procurement team he</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1000-1
03:29:45.162 --> 03:29:50.272
<v Josh Sparkes>takes to do with the data management
centre that we just do,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1000-2
03:29:50.272 --> 03:29:56.387
<v Josh Sparkes>the purely the statement make to clear it
down for a pain of coming out.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1000-3
03:29:56.387 --> 03:29:59.821
<v Josh Sparkes>But the cash cards are managed by AP, so.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1001-0
03:29:59.941 --> 03:30:05.683
<v Josh Sparkes>So we would maybe get an e-mail request
done from someone saying that they're</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1001-1
03:30:05.683 --> 03:30:11.352
<v Josh Sparkes>going to be travelling in down to London
for a specific a week or two. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1001-2
03:30:11.352 --> 03:30:15.621
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we need to get their managers
approval approval.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1002-0
03:30:16.021 --> 03:30:21.313
<v Josh Sparkes>And then we need to give them the cards,
and once it's been approved that their</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1002-1
03:30:21.313 --> 03:30:25.083
<v Josh Sparkes>manager said, yeah,
they are going down the approve from</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1002-2
03:30:25.083 --> 03:30:29.911
<v Josh Sparkes>getting a card to. I want a card.
I want a corporate card so it can be I</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1002-3
03:30:29.911 --> 03:30:34.541
<v Josh Sparkes>want a card and then pick up cases.
I'm going through the week field.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1003-0
03:30:35.021 --> 03:30:39.404
<v Josh Sparkes>You're not issuing a credit card.
You could go through the same sort of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1003-1
03:30:39.404 --> 03:30:42.265
<v Josh Sparkes>process.
Could you for issuing with a OR is it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1003-2
03:30:42.265 --> 03:30:45.370
<v Josh Sparkes>here it is. They just come and get it.
Yeah, well,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1003-3
03:30:45.370 --> 03:30:49.144
<v Josh Sparkes>basically they just e-mail them to say
that they've got that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1003-4
03:30:49.144 --> 03:30:52.492
<v Josh Sparkes>They're going down to London for sister
office travel.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1003-5
03:30:52.492 --> 03:30:54.501
<v Josh Sparkes>That is the only reason that the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1004-0
03:30:54.901 --> 03:30:57.584
<v Josh Sparkes>Ask Ashley for sister office travel.
Basically,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1004-1
03:30:57.584 --> 03:31:01.943
<v Josh Sparkes>the other ones who don't might not be
eligible for an Amex because they might</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1004-2
03:31:01.943 --> 03:31:05.743
<v Josh Sparkes>be at a junior rule, for example,
because they still want to spend,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1004-3
03:31:05.743 --> 03:31:10.103
<v Josh Sparkes>but they don't want to spend that one
personal and get a dream versus player.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1004-4
03:31:10.103 --> 03:31:14.741
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, exactly. So they're the ones like.
No, I want you to pay. So give me a pass.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1005-0
03:31:14.861 --> 03:31:19.303
<v Josh Sparkes>But not MX, still will come.
Could it still come through the front</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1005-1
03:31:19.303 --> 03:31:23.346
<v Josh Sparkes>door requested you are.
So thanks to the fact that they know</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1005-2
03:31:23.346 --> 03:31:27.721
<v Josh Sparkes>they're calling cash card.
But it could be what the category they</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1005-3
03:31:27.721 --> 03:31:33.224
<v Josh Sparkes>call it listing Sister office for. Yeah.
Those credit cards are those being loaded</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1005-4
03:31:33.224 --> 03:31:33.621
<v Josh Sparkes>debit.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1006-0
03:31:34.941 --> 03:31:38.397
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, top of cards. You know,
like top of cards, like, you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1006-1
03:31:38.397 --> 03:31:42.120
<v Josh Sparkes>some sort of balance in there, isn't it?
Yeah, it's the in cash plus.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1006-2
03:31:42.120 --> 03:31:45.629
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's the the employer.
So we can only manage that and just see</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1006-3
03:31:45.629 --> 03:31:49.829
<v Josh Sparkes>what the spend is and we talk up the
account as and when they're spent because</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1006-4
03:31:49.829 --> 03:31:52.541
<v Josh Sparkes>there's particularly maybe times in the
year that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1008-0
03:31:52.941 --> 03:31:57.232
<v Josh Sparkes>People are travelling more than others
and we just top up the account to be at</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1008-1
03:31:57.232 --> 03:32:00.437
<v Josh Sparkes>that front door,
capturing them as part of your knowledge,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1008-2
03:32:00.437 --> 03:32:04.565
<v Josh Sparkes>asking or you know you've there's this
card available. They can request it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1008-3
03:32:04.565 --> 03:32:08.421
<v Josh Sparkes>So because they're selected visiting the
office or covering office or.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1009-0
03:32:09.381 --> 03:32:12.000
<v Josh Sparkes>And that that shuts out a lot of the
process,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1009-1
03:32:12.000 --> 03:32:16.669
<v Josh Sparkes>but you still capture that you're issuing
a card, so it's managed under the same.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1009-2
03:32:16.669 --> 03:32:20.597
<v Josh Sparkes>Well, it's just a different type,
which is that they call cash card,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1009-3
03:32:20.597 --> 03:32:24.241
<v Josh Sparkes>but there's still a card.
And because they have free balance of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1009-4
03:32:24.241 --> 03:32:27.486
<v Josh Sparkes>preloaded cars,
the risk is less as well because we know</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1009-5
03:32:27.486 --> 03:32:27.941
<v Josh Sparkes>what is.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1010-0
03:32:28.741 --> 03:32:32.741
<v Josh Sparkes>What is what we're doing approval.
There's an approval process.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1010-1
03:32:32.741 --> 03:32:37.740
<v Josh Sparkes>Is that the manager that we still? Yeah.
Not the first time. Yeah, for my card.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1010-2
03:32:37.740 --> 03:32:42.427
<v Josh Sparkes>We have to get the managers approval.
So we get that usually in form of an</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1010-3
03:32:42.427 --> 03:32:47.239
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail. And then once we've got that,
we then arrange to be in the office on</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1010-4
03:32:47.239 --> 03:32:48.301
<v Josh Sparkes>the day that the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1011-0
03:32:49.341 --> 03:32:54.051
<v Josh Sparkes>And need that for that. You. Seriously,
we usually end certain days of the week.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1011-1
03:32:54.051 --> 03:32:56.726
<v Josh Sparkes>So we try and coordinate it right about
that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1011-2
03:32:56.726 --> 03:33:00.971
<v Josh Sparkes>If they are travelling urgently and
they've just been told of it then we</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1011-3
03:33:00.971 --> 03:33:05.158
<v Josh Sparkes>arranged to come in probably three of
those phases that we discussed of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1011-4
03:33:05.158 --> 03:33:08.181
<v Josh Sparkes>corporate cars who've got renewal request
approval.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1012-0
03:33:08.421 --> 03:33:12.621
<v Josh Sparkes>And then issued effectively and so we can
incorporate that into that.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1013-0
03:33:21.541 --> 03:33:26.692
<v Josh Sparkes>I was just going to ask if these people
are requesting a card like just to come</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1013-1
03:33:26.692 --> 03:33:29.847
<v Josh Sparkes>into the office like temporarily not
constantly,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1013-2
03:33:29.847 --> 03:33:33.131
<v Josh Sparkes>do they then have to return the card
after or yes,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1013-3
03:33:33.131 --> 03:33:36.221
<v Josh Sparkes>I mean we usually once they finish their
truck.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1014-0
03:33:36.701 --> 03:33:37.581
<v Josh Sparkes>Can you turn it back?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1015-0
03:33:39.301 --> 03:33:44.489
<v Josh Sparkes>You can capture something from that you
know return base. Yeah, we've got.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1015-1
03:33:44.489 --> 03:33:48.708
<v Josh Sparkes>We've got a log so.
But basically when we hand out the cards</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1015-2
03:33:48.708 --> 03:33:52.444
<v Josh Sparkes>we've got,
we've got a list of like the card numbers.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1015-3
03:33:52.444 --> 03:33:58.115
<v Josh Sparkes>And who's got that card? And when it ends,
yes. But you could use it. Yeah. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1015-4
03:33:58.115 --> 03:33:58.461
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1016-0
03:33:59.981 --> 03:34:05.252
<v Josh Sparkes>Do you have a standard pre loaded amount?
It's standard or is it a matrix of role</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1016-1
03:34:05.252 --> 03:34:10.459
<v Josh Sparkes>and etcetera for the pre loaded amount
it's just the cards number like the cards</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1016-2
03:34:10.459 --> 03:34:15.601
<v Josh Sparkes>details who's got the card when they're
returning so that we can then go in and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1016-3
03:34:15.601 --> 03:34:18.301
<v Josh Sparkes>if they don't return it to us then we can.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1017-0
03:34:18.701 --> 03:34:23.260
<v Josh Sparkes>Up and say, well, your travels.
Now you talk like you've came back from</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1017-1
03:34:23.260 --> 03:34:26.870
<v Josh Sparkes>your travel like you need to hand us back
that category.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1017-2
03:34:26.870 --> 03:34:30.479
<v Josh Sparkes>And if it has for any reason that they've
extended that,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1017-3
03:34:30.479 --> 03:34:34.595
<v Josh Sparkes>then we can update the login and if not
for anything on the yes,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1017-4
03:34:34.595 --> 03:34:35.861
<v Josh Sparkes>it's just like like.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1018-0
03:34:36.421 --> 03:34:42.120
<v Josh Sparkes>We're told that the event and we just
manage the account balance and do the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1018-1
03:34:42.120 --> 03:34:47.818
<v Josh Sparkes>manual payment as and when required.
So do you do the balance to use a exit</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1018-2
03:34:47.818 --> 03:34:53.292
<v Josh Sparkes>handover balance return balance?
You check it so that it's got the money</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1018-3
03:34:53.292 --> 03:34:55.541
<v Josh Sparkes>on it. So when we we send out.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1019-0
03:34:55.661 --> 03:34:59.178
<v Josh Sparkes>Monthly statements.
So when they return the cards to us,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1019-1
03:34:59.178 --> 03:35:04.177
<v Josh Sparkes>we tell them they need to give a hold of
the receipts because once the statement</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1019-2
03:35:04.177 --> 03:35:07.447
<v Josh Sparkes>comes out,
we will be sending it to them for them to</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1019-3
03:35:07.447 --> 03:35:10.532
<v Josh Sparkes>code it,
get approval and give us the receipts so</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1019-4
03:35:10.532 --> 03:35:11.581
<v Josh Sparkes>that we can then.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1020-0
03:35:11.861 --> 03:35:16.775
<v Josh Sparkes>In process onto the system,
but we go into the account every week and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1020-1
03:35:16.775 --> 03:35:22.250
<v Josh Sparkes>we've got like just in our own head that
we know that that that is a process.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1020-2
03:35:22.250 --> 03:35:25.970
<v Josh Sparkes>And if it fall,
if the balance falls below a certain</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1020-3
03:35:25.970 --> 03:35:29.058
<v Josh Sparkes>amount,
then we top it up just so that it's</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1020-4
03:35:29.058 --> 03:35:30.181
<v Josh Sparkes>that's a weekly.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1021-0
03:35:30.541 --> 03:35:35.032
<v Josh Sparkes>Request calls. Yeah, yeah, as well.
But we could trigger.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1021-1
03:35:35.032 --> 03:35:40.297
<v Josh Sparkes>So you can do that activity and then it
sounded like you reconcile.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1021-2
03:35:40.297 --> 03:35:46.181
<v Josh Sparkes>So the reconciliation process and the
major or main reconciliation process.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1022-0
03:35:46.501 --> 03:35:49.017
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
And then there's a schedule request for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1022-1
03:35:49.017 --> 03:35:53.065
<v Josh Sparkes>that as well in to download the
statements and to upload them in time for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1022-2
03:35:53.065 --> 03:35:55.471
<v Josh Sparkes>month end,
because that isn't a direct day,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1022-3
03:35:55.471 --> 03:35:59.191
<v Josh Sparkes>but as such that comes out.
But we need to make sure that it's time</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1022-4
03:35:59.191 --> 03:36:03.184
<v Josh Sparkes>for so that reconciliation process,
but we're talking that month and you</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1022-5
03:36:03.184 --> 03:36:06.301
<v Josh Sparkes>could have the cash cards,
you know you could have your.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1023-0
03:36:06.381 --> 03:36:08.860
<v Josh Sparkes>Activities, if it was taken, go to,
you know,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1023-1
03:36:08.860 --> 03:36:12.739
<v Josh Sparkes>rather than the whole cash cards
reconciled and the other activity that</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1023-2
03:36:12.739 --> 03:36:15.541
<v Josh Sparkes>you recognise the checklist and then like
all this.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1024-0
03:36:18.341 --> 03:36:21.290
<v Josh Sparkes>And if there's any special purchases on
that card,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1024-1
03:36:21.290 --> 03:36:24.701
<v Josh Sparkes>are you still doing the salary deductions?
The back of it?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1025-0
03:36:27.421 --> 03:36:32.421
<v Josh Sparkes>I'll be that that would depend on where
they've quoted it to the quoted stuff and.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1026-0
03:36:34.061 --> 03:36:38.884
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't if they don't have the receipt
for it, then they've already spent it,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1026-1
03:36:38.884 --> 03:36:41.876
<v Josh Sparkes>so we can't unless it's a a cost that
they have.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1026-2
03:36:41.876 --> 03:36:45.234
<v Josh Sparkes>They're disputing that when we send the
statement out,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1026-3
03:36:45.234 --> 03:36:50.301
<v Josh Sparkes>they come back and say I didn't use the
card for that. Then we reduce the dispute.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1027-0
03:36:50.701 --> 03:36:54.715
<v Josh Sparkes>But if they've coded it and like said
that they've spent that,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1027-1
03:36:54.715 --> 03:36:59.302
<v Josh Sparkes>but they just have misplaced the receipt
or maybe didn't get a receipt,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1027-2
03:36:59.302 --> 03:37:04.399
<v Josh Sparkes>then it does sound like that cash card
reconciliation then like we talked about</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1027-3
03:37:04.399 --> 03:37:06.501
<v Josh Sparkes>happy path for reconciliation or?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1028-0
03:37:07.661 --> 03:37:11.220
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm sorry, we've got to,
maybe they just need to be that ability</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1028-1
03:37:11.220 --> 03:37:14.176
<v Josh Sparkes>to dispute or they raised.
I mean that's exceptional,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1028-2
03:37:14.176 --> 03:37:17.461
<v Josh Sparkes>but it could be built into the workflow
just to capture it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1029-0
03:37:21.301 --> 03:37:27.095
<v Josh Sparkes>And so cash cards and then the issue of
that can fall under the service of</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1029-1
03:37:27.095 --> 03:37:32.966
<v Josh Sparkes>managing corporate card and the request
and department cards reconciliation</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1029-2
03:37:32.966 --> 03:37:35.901
<v Josh Sparkes>family the same way. Do you reconcile?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1030-0
03:37:36.661 --> 03:37:40.243
<v Josh Sparkes>Because that for your reconciliation
process as well, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1030-1
03:37:40.243 --> 03:37:44.899
<v Josh Sparkes>So we download the statements at the
start of the month and the direct debits</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1030-2
03:37:44.899 --> 03:37:47.824
<v Josh Sparkes>usually taken about the 27th,
28th of the month.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1030-3
03:37:47.824 --> 03:37:52.301
<v Josh Sparkes>So we send them out at the start of the
month again like that with they're</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1030-4
03:37:52.301 --> 03:37:55.704
<v Josh Sparkes>spending money on it,
we asked them to keep the receipts</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1030-5
03:37:55.704 --> 03:37:56.181
<v Josh Sparkes>because.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1031-0
03:37:56.501 --> 03:37:58.914
<v Josh Sparkes>We will be sending them out monthly
statements,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1031-1
03:37:58.914 --> 03:38:02.131
<v Josh Sparkes>but they can and all that anyway because
they've got the cards.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1031-2
03:38:02.131 --> 03:38:05.749
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's like a monthly process.
We'll send the statement of their spend</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1031-3
03:38:05.749 --> 03:38:08.614
<v Josh Sparkes>for that month.
They get approved quota and send it back</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1031-4
03:38:08.614 --> 03:38:12.635
<v Josh Sparkes>with the receipts and then we process it
onto the system in time for the direct</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1031-5
03:38:12.635 --> 03:38:15.701
<v Josh Sparkes>debit to be taken.
And is there a case where the department?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1032-0
03:38:15.821 --> 03:38:20.626
<v Josh Sparkes>And all goes together to something,
and multiple people might be spending on</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1032-1
03:38:20.626 --> 03:38:23.870
<v Josh Sparkes>the same day,
and they've all got to keep their own</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1032-2
03:38:23.870 --> 03:38:27.988
<v Josh Sparkes>receipts that happened.
Or is it normally issued 1 to one because</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1032-3
03:38:27.988 --> 03:38:32.668
<v Josh Sparkes>department cars 1 to one? Sorry.
Department. Department cars. They should.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1032-4
03:38:32.668 --> 03:38:35.101
<v Josh Sparkes>Whoever has got the catch and all this.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1033-0
03:38:35.861 --> 03:38:38.555
<v Josh Sparkes>On it,
we have had occasions that someone's had</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1033-1
03:38:38.555 --> 03:38:42.932
<v Josh Sparkes>a card and someone's got hold of that
card for whatever reason and have spent</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1033-2
03:38:42.932 --> 03:38:46.580
<v Josh Sparkes>on the card and we've had to cancel it
because then that person,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1033-3
03:38:46.580 --> 03:38:51.237
<v Josh Sparkes>when it comes to reconciling the account
or the statement at the end of the month,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1033-4
03:38:51.237 --> 03:38:54.941
<v Josh Sparkes>they've got all these transactions and
then they can't manage it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1034-0
03:38:55.621 --> 03:38:58.964
<v Josh Sparkes>These don't know who had the cards at
certain times,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1034-1
03:38:58.964 --> 03:39:04.074
<v Josh Sparkes>so we asked that if it is a departmental
card that one person is responsible for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1034-2
03:39:04.074 --> 03:39:08.489
<v Josh Sparkes>that so that they what's going to be so
the business will one to one.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1034-3
03:39:08.489 --> 03:39:12.021
<v Josh Sparkes>The department is still for all we go
issuing 1 to one.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1035-0
03:39:12.221 --> 03:39:16.206
<v Josh Sparkes>And the names pass been saying the cash
cards 1 to one name pass. Yeah,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1035-1
03:39:16.206 --> 03:39:19.859
<v Josh Sparkes>they're responsible for that. Actually,
during those dates. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1035-2
03:39:19.859 --> 03:39:23.733
<v Josh Sparkes>Not something we want to be honest about.
At least on the cash cards.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1035-3
03:39:23.733 --> 03:39:28.050
<v Josh Sparkes>You tried push back, but yeah, I mean,
it's kind of the business requirements</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1035-4
03:39:28.050 --> 03:39:29.821
<v Josh Sparkes>sometimes, which I don't get it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1036-0
03:39:32.141 --> 03:39:36.550
<v Josh Sparkes>But it was like it was ages ago when they
like when the office first started and</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1036-1
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:40.687
<v Josh Sparkes>the legal analysts were doing a lot of
that came about. Yeah. So when when,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1036-2
03:39:40.687 --> 03:39:45.205
<v Josh Sparkes>when some of them I remember like two or
three of them when they expired we didn't</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1036-3
03:39:45.205 --> 03:39:48.090
<v Josh Sparkes>renew them.
We want to minimise and try and phase it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1036-4
03:39:48.090 --> 03:39:49.941
<v Josh Sparkes>out as much as possible but again.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1037-0
03:39:50.461 --> 03:39:51.861
<v Josh Sparkes>We we can't do it very much.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1038-0
03:39:55.701 --> 03:40:01.276
<v Josh Sparkes>They'll be in the, you know, as you said,
juniors or they want to travel their rent</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1038-1
03:40:01.276 --> 03:40:05.258
<v Josh Sparkes>costs more than they've ever and you know,
budgets limited.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1038-2
03:40:05.258 --> 03:40:10.236
<v Josh Sparkes>So I understand the needs, Sandeep,
is this something we're picking up for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1038-3
03:40:10.236 --> 03:40:10.501
<v Josh Sparkes>the?</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1039-0
03:40:11.461 --> 03:40:15.674
<v Josh Sparkes>US as well. Also,
there's no cash card or it's just like</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1039-1
03:40:15.674 --> 03:40:19.960
<v Josh Sparkes>the corporate and it's OK.
Department cars in the US. No,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1039-2
03:40:19.960 --> 03:40:24.837
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't think so. Yeah, even if they are,
they will deal with it.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1039-3
03:40:24.837 --> 03:40:27.941
<v Josh Sparkes>They're just picking up. That makes sense.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1040-0
03:40:30.021 --> 03:40:36.581
<v Josh Sparkes>No, you're not. It's UK manage under this,
still global.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1041-0
03:40:40.981 --> 03:40:44.321
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
I think we've called 11 processes in</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1041-1
03:40:44.321 --> 03:40:48.593
<v Josh Sparkes>there with stuff being my details to
bring it up to 1.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1041-2
03:40:48.593 --> 03:40:54.573
<v Josh Sparkes>So that's good for that's cash cards.
Yeah. And I think we'd get some lunch.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1041-3
03:40:54.573 --> 03:40:58.301
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, we all everybody,
1:45 returns 12:45 one.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1042-0
03:41:01.981 --> 03:41:06.578
<v Josh Sparkes>What if we do well,
we let me have a look the the two options,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1042-1
03:41:06.578 --> 03:41:09.861
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice payments and manage manage
expenses.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1043-0
03:41:11.701 --> 03:41:11.861
<v Josh Sparkes>OK.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1044-0
03:41:14.941 --> 03:41:19.636
<v Josh Sparkes>There's a big topic,
but you have lots of manage payments for</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1044-1
03:41:19.636 --> 03:41:25.541
<v Josh Sparkes>hospitality, for rent for, you know,
it was a long. There was a lot in there.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1045-0
03:41:25.901 --> 03:41:26.021
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1047-0
03:41:30.021 --> 03:41:34.045
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah,
because payments can loads of because it</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1047-1
03:41:34.045 --> 03:41:39.867
<v Josh Sparkes>actually, again not trivialising.
There's lots whether the managing</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1047-2
03:41:39.867 --> 03:41:43.976
<v Josh Sparkes>invoices,
but is the payment on the back of the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1047-3
03:41:43.976 --> 03:41:44.661
<v Josh Sparkes>invoice.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1048-0
03:41:45.341 --> 03:41:48.621
<v Josh Sparkes>Maybe since that would be there,
but maybe I mean.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1049-0
03:41:49.981 --> 03:41:54.181
<v Josh Sparkes>Invoices first up. Yeah,
I think that's yeah, yeah. Invoice.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1050-0
03:41:56.421 --> 03:41:58.301
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh yeah, sorry, yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1051-0
03:42:03.821 --> 03:42:07.863
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, yeah. But they are separate. Yeah,
I agree.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1051-1
03:42:07.863 --> 03:42:14.571
<v Josh Sparkes>When we were looking at sort of standard
offering or what's best practise that the</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1051-2
03:42:14.571 --> 03:42:19.501
<v Josh Sparkes>payment becomes a sub task of the overall
environment. Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1055-0
03:42:20.941 --> 03:42:29.661
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, right. 1:45. Shall we? Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1053-0

<v Josh Sparkes>Do you want to put your finger in charge?
I'll probably share some more.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1060-1
03:43:01.541 --> 03:43:06.381
<v Josh Sparkes>Would it be? Let's look,
I think seriously. Is it? Yeah.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1061-0
03:43:08.381 --> 03:43:13.712
<v Josh Sparkes>Just when you put so this one's fully
charged. I was fully charged.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1061-1
03:43:13.712 --> 03:43:20.061
<v Josh Sparkes>That's quite good, actually, Timmy. Sir.
I mean, if you want to call for charge,</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1061-2
03:43:20.061 --> 03:43:22.021
<v Josh Sparkes>something the big of the.</v>

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1062-0
03:43:23.621 --> 03:43:28.643

a98e68ff-a5ef-4d62-a994-2a4b99e79cb2/1063-0
