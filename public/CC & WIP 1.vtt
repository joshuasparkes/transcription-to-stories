00:04:17.832 --> 00:04:20.592
<v Marwan Altaie>It should be.
Also can the teams people hear us?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/30-0
00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:22.712
<v Max Trickett>Yeah, that's much better.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/33-0
00:04:23.232 --> 00:04:26.665
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, cool. Sorry.
You've been on mute for the last 10</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/32-0
00:04:26.352 --> 00:04:26.832
<v Max Trickett>No problems.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/33-1
00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:31.134
<v Marwan Altaie>minutes. Apologies and cameras.
All working as you're looking at the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/33-2
00:04:31.134 --> 00:04:31.912
<v Marwan Altaie>right group.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/34-0
00:04:34.432 --> 00:04:35.512
<v Max Trickett>Yeah, it looks looks good.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/35-0
00:04:34.832 --> 00:04:35.152
<v Parik Narain>Yes.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/37-0
00:04:36.992 --> 00:04:44.653
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, someone tried to just join.
Are you in or do you need me to switch</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/37-1
00:04:44.653 --> 00:04:49.832
<v Marwan Altaie>across? Are you in the meeting? Yeah. OK,
cool.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/38-0
00:04:54.992 --> 00:04:57.776
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.
So we're going to go through the original</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/38-1
00:04:57.776 --> 00:05:00.622
<v Marwan Altaie>list.
We've managed to get through two so far,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/38-2
00:05:00.622 --> 00:05:04.556
<v Marwan Altaie>but we're just going to push ahead
without Martin at the moment.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/38-3
00:05:04.556 --> 00:05:08.552
<v Marwan Altaie>If there's any decisions or actions we
need afterwards should be.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/39-0
00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:14.112
<v Marwan Altaie>Double check. Yeah,
recording and transcription started by me.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/40-0
00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:16.272
<v Marwan Altaie>Should be.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/41-0
00:05:23.192 --> 00:05:23.432
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/42-0
00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.232
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool. So let's get into it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/43-0
00:05:36.992 --> 00:05:41.352
<v Marwan Altaie>Same process as before as the process map,
I pulled the cash collections from.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/46-0
00:05:42.672 --> 00:05:47.272
<v Marwan Altaie>On the left side is the as is the process.
Based on what I've been provided,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/46-1
00:05:47.272 --> 00:05:51.215
<v Marwan Altaie>if there's changes or it's been
standardised for whatever reason,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/46-2
00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:54.561
<v Marwan Altaie>please shout out high level fee
allocation is required.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/46-3
00:05:54.561 --> 00:05:59.461
<v Marwan Altaie>Cashier is driving the majority of this,
so this is probably one of the processes</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/46-4
00:05:59.461 --> 00:06:01.552
<v Marwan Altaie>where it's in line with cashiering.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/48-0
00:06:02.312 --> 00:06:05.105
<v Marwan Altaie>And cashier raises it credit control
reviews.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/48-1
00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:10.084
<v Marwan Altaie>If there's an allocation instruction that
go to the client and then it's a credit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/48-2
00:06:10.084 --> 00:06:14.395
<v Marwan Altaie>manager for approval and then a cashier
actions, the final allocation,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/48-3
00:06:14.395 --> 00:06:19.192
<v Marwan Altaie>allocation or rejection is that in line
with what you expect for this process.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/49-0
00:06:19.472 --> 00:06:22.581
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah,
has this been broken out with the because</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/49-1
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:25.432
<v Marwan Altaie>it was 6 processes originally,
wasn't that?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/50-0
00:06:26.832 --> 00:06:30.154
<v Marwan Altaie>I looked at the six maps.
I'm guessing this has been broken out in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/50-1
00:06:30.154 --> 00:06:32.931
<v Marwan Altaie>a bit more detail,
so this is based on the process that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/50-2
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:35.162
<v Marwan Altaie>thing provided in the cache collection
term.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/50-3
00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that safe to say that's amalgamated?
The other process there was 8 maps,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/50-4
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.352
<v Marwan Altaie>OK got you. It's multiple maps,
wasn't there across some of the way?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/51-0
00:06:43.792 --> 00:06:48.712
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, cool.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/52-0
00:06:50.032 --> 00:06:53.035
<v Marwan Altaie>So this is for sorry,
I just dropped my stuff.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/52-1
00:06:53.035 --> 00:06:56.038
<v Marwan Altaie>This is for cash collection.
Payment comes in.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/52-2
00:06:56.038 --> 00:07:00.192
<v Marwan Altaie>Don't know what it's for.
We get the allocation. Yeah. OK, cool.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/53-0
00:07:02.912 --> 00:07:05.170
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry,
I'm just sharing the link to Martin so</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/53-1
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.232
<v Marwan Altaie>you should be joining remotely, all right.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/54-0
00:07:10.872 --> 00:07:12.912
<v Marwan Altaie>It was getting a couple minutes and then
going through it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/55-0
00:07:15.112 --> 00:07:19.192
<v Marwan Altaie>So first question is does that align with
what you'd expect from cache collection?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/60-0
00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:45.797
<v Marwan Altaie>So cashier's lost credit control and they
don't know what the allocation is,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/60-1
00:07:45.797 --> 00:07:46.392
<v Marwan Altaie>what it is.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/61-0
00:07:48.872 --> 00:07:52.192
<v Marwan Altaie>We tell them cash or credit.
I'll tell cashiers what the occasion is.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/62-0
00:07:53.432 --> 00:07:54.632
<v Marwan Altaie>If we don't know.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/63-0
00:07:56.632 --> 00:07:56.872
<v Marwan Altaie>Umm.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/64-0
00:07:58.352 --> 00:08:03.884
<v Marwan Altaie>There it goes to something else,
and this is where it's a split between UK</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/64-1
00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:07.942
<v Marwan Altaie>and Australia.
So do you want to do keep the processes</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/64-2
00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:13.032
<v Marwan Altaie>separate or do you want to have an
overarching process and then you?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/65-0
00:08:13.672 --> 00:08:14.472
<v Marwan Altaie>Do I?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/66-0
00:08:17.672 --> 00:08:19.432
<v Marwan Altaie>A sub process that's different for.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/67-0
00:08:21.072 --> 00:08:23.601
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes,
probably you've got and I would say we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/67-1
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:28.314
<v Marwan Altaie>are. This is because this is regulated.
There are no however much I would like to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/67-2
00:08:28.314 --> 00:08:30.900
<v Marwan Altaie>standardise. If we can't,
we're just we are,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/67-3
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.912
<v Marwan Altaie>we are governed by SRA rules, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/68-0
00:08:36.032 --> 00:08:37.152
<v Marwan Altaie>Can we?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/69-0
00:08:39.432 --> 00:08:44.802
<v Marwan Altaie>Is the ultimate closure of this is that
standard across as in the actors are.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/69-1
00:08:44.802 --> 00:08:48.658
<v Marwan Altaie>Are they completely different?
The actors are the same,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/69-2
00:08:48.658 --> 00:08:53.272
<v Marwan Altaie>but the actions and process and handoffs
are different. OK, let's.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/70-0
00:08:55.272 --> 00:08:58.509
<v Marwan Altaie>Should we do Australia first?
I'm assuming the difference between</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/70-1
00:08:58.509 --> 00:09:02.432
<v Marwan Altaie>Australia and the rest of the world.
Australia is a lot more complicated. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/70-2
00:09:02.432 --> 00:09:04.884
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, typical Australians.
The UK is a lot simpler,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/70-3
00:09:04.884 --> 00:09:08.857
<v Marwan Altaie>so I don't even want to start the simple.
Why don't you just start with the hard</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/70-4
00:09:08.857 --> 00:09:10.672
<v Marwan Altaie>one? Let's do the hard one first, OK?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/71-0
00:09:11.792 --> 00:09:14.032
<v Marwan Altaie>Go take me through, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/73-0
00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.752
<v Marwan Altaie>And please try in and you I'll get it
wrong.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/75-0
00:09:20.752 --> 00:09:24.921
<v Marwan Altaie>A payment comes into the account.
Cashiers will contact credit control to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/75-1
00:09:24.921 --> 00:09:29.147
<v Marwan Altaie>say we have payment X from so and so
whatever they have and credit control</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/75-2
00:09:29.147 --> 00:09:32.753
<v Marwan Altaie>will try to apply that payment.
If they can apply that payment.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/75-3
00:09:32.753 --> 00:09:36.472
<v Marwan Altaie>If they know what it goes against,
they will respond to cashiers.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/76-0
00:09:37.112 --> 00:09:40.272
<v Marwan Altaie>Right. Job done. Cash is posted.
We're all good.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/77-0
00:09:41.792 --> 00:09:44.752
<v Marwan Altaie>If they can allocate part of that payment.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/78-0
00:09:46.072 --> 00:09:48.312
<v Marwan Altaie>They will allocate part of that payment.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/79-0
00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:54.746
<v Marwan Altaie>Anna, This is why I'm asking you.
Does it go straight to suspense or does</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/79-1
00:09:54.746 --> 00:09:57.832
<v Marwan Altaie>it go on allocated first the full like
this?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/80-0
00:09:59.312 --> 00:10:03.663
<v Marwan Altaie>Process would be triggered by items that
cannot be allocated.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/80-1
00:10:03.663 --> 00:10:09.349
<v Marwan Altaie>So technically this and the unallocated
items are almost one and the same. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/80-2
00:10:09.349 --> 00:10:14.192
<v Marwan Altaie>because anything of the bank statement
that cashiers can't allocate.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/81-0
00:10:15.432 --> 00:10:20.528
<v Marwan Altaie>Goes on the unallocated list and it could
be we have no ribbons advice.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/81-1
00:10:20.528 --> 00:10:26.191
<v Marwan Altaie>We can't identify who this belongs to or
it's a partial payment with an invoice</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/81-2
00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:30.792
<v Marwan Altaie>reversed or overpayment.
What do you want to do with it? That's.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/83-0
00:10:31.512 --> 00:10:33.902
<v Marwan Altaie>Basically,
where do you post a receipt onto an</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/83-1
00:10:33.902 --> 00:10:37.310
<v Marwan Altaie>allocated straight away?
Or do you wait for do you e-mail the team</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/83-2
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.430
<v Marwan Altaie>first during the day and say do you know
what it is and you wait for a response?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/83-3
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.380
<v Marwan Altaie>Would you just say straight to an
allocated it has to go?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/83-4
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.992
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah e-mail and post to Unallocate have
to happen at the same time OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/84-0
00:10:49.072 --> 00:10:51.920
<v Marwan Altaie>Otherwise,
it could be just duplicates like your</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/84-1
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.223
<v Marwan Altaie>team could e-mail back, but yeah,
we've got to post them both at the same</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/84-2
00:10:56.223 --> 00:11:00.409
<v Marwan Altaie>time. OK, so so quick question.
Is the unallocated accounts what you're</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/84-3
00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:05.060
<v Marwan Altaie>talking about now or is it unallocated
payment? Yeah. Are they one of the same?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/84-4
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.432
<v Marwan Altaie>Basically pretty much there is no reason
for cashiers to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/85-0
00:11:08.512 --> 00:11:12.856
<v Marwan Altaie>To contact credit control about payments,
unless it can't be,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/85-1
00:11:12.856 --> 00:11:15.939
<v Marwan Altaie>unless they don't know where to post it
to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/85-2
00:11:15.939 --> 00:11:20.214
<v Marwan Altaie>So cashiers have the remittance inbox
that they'll refer to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/85-3
00:11:20.214 --> 00:11:24.488
<v Marwan Altaie>There'll be references to invoices in on
the bank statement.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/85-4
00:11:24.488 --> 00:11:27.992
<v Marwan Altaie>And then we've also got a report that we
can run.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/86-0
00:11:28.912 --> 00:11:33.901
<v Marwan Altaie>That we can confirm basically that we
think that this payment is there for.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/86-1
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:38.957
<v Marwan Altaie>So once we've exhausted all of those
options and there's still a list of 561</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/86-2
00:11:38.957 --> 00:11:42.765
<v Marwan Altaie>payment that we can't allocate,
we don't know what it is,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/86-3
00:11:42.765 --> 00:11:47.952
<v Marwan Altaie>that's when it becomes unallocated and it
goes to credit control. So this pro.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/87-0
00:11:48.352 --> 00:11:53.673
<v Marwan Altaie>What we're saying that the cache cache is
identify fees requiring allocation,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/87-1
00:11:53.673 --> 00:11:58.312
<v Marwan Altaie>that essentially is what our unallocated
process starts off as, OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/88-0
00:12:01.272 --> 00:12:06.361
<v Marwan Altaie>So is it essentially 2 separate processes,
but it's driven by the same trigger?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/88-1
00:12:06.361 --> 00:12:09.352
<v Marwan Altaie>If you want to call it that, I guess so,
yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/89-0
00:12:13.832 --> 00:12:18.401
<v Marwan Altaie>OK. Is it the easiest way to do this?
Just go through each one individually and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/89-1
00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:22.285
<v Marwan Altaie>I guess another question is,
how many regions do we have to account</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/89-2
00:12:22.285 --> 00:12:25.655
<v Marwan Altaie>for? We've got Australia,
we've got the rest of the world.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/89-3
00:12:25.655 --> 00:12:27.712
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that in one bucket or it does OK?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/90-0
00:12:28.512 --> 00:12:33.392
<v Marwan Altaie>I want to say that who does European and
Middle East patricism.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/91-0
00:12:36.552 --> 00:12:39.407
<v Marwan Altaie>Done in the office,
done in the local offices so it's not</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/91-1
00:12:39.407 --> 00:12:41.672
<v Marwan Altaie>controlled by alsford governments.
Thank you.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/92-0
00:12:45.312 --> 00:12:48.680
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, yeah.
Everything else it's done by Testy's team.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/92-1
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.828
<v Marwan Altaie>PNG's done locally. Asia's done locally.
I think a lot of Asia comes out of Hong</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/92-2
00:12:53.828 --> 00:12:56.752
<v Marwan Altaie>Kong. OK,
so we're only looking at Australia.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/93-0
00:12:58.272 --> 00:13:04.472
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Glasgow covers Luxemburg, New York,
Dublin and Brussels as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/94-0
00:13:09.912 --> 00:13:10.552
<v Marwan Altaie>Voice from above.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/95-0
00:13:13.232 --> 00:13:13.392
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/96-0
00:13:16.152 --> 00:13:17.672
<v Marwan Altaie>They all on the same process, Martin.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/97-0
00:13:19.192 --> 00:13:23.593
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>They're all triggered the same way as
what we would do in the UK or Australia,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/97-1
00:13:23.593 --> 00:13:27.549
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but not all of these offices have got
client accounts, sort of. Again,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/97-2
00:13:27.549 --> 00:13:28.552
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>look at their own.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/101-0
00:13:30.192 --> 00:13:34.342
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Kind of sub processes depending on what's
happening with the funds,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/101-1
00:13:34.342 --> 00:13:37.516
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we can move from their client account,
for example,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/99-0
00:13:34.352 --> 00:13:34.472
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/101-2
00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:42.216
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>because they don't have client accounts.
So how we deal with them or just it</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/100-0
00:13:38.792 --> 00:13:38.912
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/101-3
00:13:42.216 --> 00:13:45.329
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>depends.
The volumes are very very low compared to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/101-4
00:13:45.329 --> 00:13:47.832
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>UK and Australia, so it tends to be that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/102-0
00:13:48.552 --> 00:13:54.085
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>But either applying the funds to invoices
or they get rejected back to the sender</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/102-1
00:13:54.085 --> 00:13:57.257
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>and we don't really have many other
scenarios.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/102-2
00:13:57.257 --> 00:14:02.723
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Most of the time there's there's not as
many issues as there is when there was a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/102-3
00:14:02.723 --> 00:14:06.232
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>cancelled and duplicate paid or whatever
in the UK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/103-0
00:14:07.872 --> 00:14:11.912
<v Marwan Altaie>So there'll be 3 processes.
Then you've got Australia process,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/103-1
00:14:11.912 --> 00:14:16.144
<v Marwan Altaie>which involves suspense and allocated.
You've got the UK process,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/103-2
00:14:16.144 --> 00:14:20.185
<v Marwan Altaie>which is governed by your SRA rules.
Your 48 hour bounce back.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/103-3
00:14:20.185 --> 00:14:23.712
<v Marwan Altaie>I think it is Stephen and Martin correct
if I'm wrong.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/104-0
00:14:24.112 --> 00:14:27.301
<v Marwan Altaie>And then you'll have the rest of the
other offices that Martin mentioned,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/104-1
00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:29.112
<v Marwan Altaie>New York, Dublin and their rosic Brussels.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/105-0
00:14:31.432 --> 00:14:33.752
<v Marwan Altaie>It will have a more simplified version of
the process.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/106-0
00:14:40.032 --> 00:14:43.867
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we have any reference to that
individual processes based on these</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/106-1
00:14:43.867 --> 00:14:44.312
<v Marwan Altaie>regions?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/107-0
00:14:46.592 --> 00:14:49.792
<v Marwan Altaie>Don't, because it don't do you.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/109-0
00:14:51.512 --> 00:14:56.284
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that documented anywhere Mark?
Does that cover your any of your process</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/109-1
00:14:56.284 --> 00:14:59.148
<v Marwan Altaie>maps?
Do you know specific processes for New</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/108-0
00:14:57.032 --> 00:14:57.432
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>And.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/109-2
00:14:59.148 --> 00:14:59.912
<v Marwan Altaie>York and Co?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/113-0
00:15:00.592 --> 00:15:04.591
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>I would imagine so,
but I'm not going to say that with any</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/110-0
00:15:02.792 --> 00:15:02.912
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/113-1
00:15:04.591 --> 00:15:08.251
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>degree of confidence,
but I think we do have maps for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/111-0
00:15:05.872 --> 00:15:05.992
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/113-2
00:15:08.251 --> 00:15:11.573
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>everything.
I would just need to double check if</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/113-3
00:15:11.573 --> 00:15:14.352
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>there's specifics for New York, etcetera.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/112-0
00:15:12.232 --> 00:15:12.472
<v Marwan Altaie>And.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/114-0
00:15:15.352 --> 00:15:19.407
<v Marwan Altaie>In regards to cache collections,
I'm just looking at the processes that I</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/114-1
00:15:19.407 --> 00:15:23.792
<v Marwan Altaie>have access to and I can see that we've
got a map for UKUSA and Luxembourg. OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/115-0
00:15:27.512 --> 00:15:29.432
<v Marwan Altaie>This is credit control.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/116-0
00:15:31.992 --> 00:15:34.712
<v Marwan Altaie>I can check an outlet.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/117-0
00:15:39.312 --> 00:15:42.992
<v Marwan Altaie>The other, obviously the sound of it,
are very simple. The payments come in,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/117-1
00:15:42.992 --> 00:15:46.721
<v Marwan Altaie>they don't know when it's allocated,
it goes to credit control to ask them if</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/117-2
00:15:46.721 --> 00:15:50.067
<v Marwan Altaie>they don't know it gets rejected back.
If they do, it gets allocated.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/117-3
00:15:50.067 --> 00:15:52.982
<v Marwan Altaie>Sounds as if that's it.
That's not missing anything. Martin.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/117-4
00:15:52.982 --> 00:15:56.472
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it safe to say that's probably in line
with yours? For the most part?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/118-0
00:15:57.632 --> 00:16:00.894
<v Marwan Altaie>Without going into the kind of obviously
Austria to have more nuances,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/118-1
00:16:00.894 --> 00:16:04.202
<v Marwan Altaie>or have I missed that nuances,
I'm trying to identify where we can kind</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/118-2
00:16:04.202 --> 00:16:06.592
<v Marwan Altaie>of start structuring and capturing those
processes.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/119-0
00:16:09.672 --> 00:16:14.054
<v Marwan Altaie>That process is potentially the same for
every single region. It could happen.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/119-1
00:16:14.054 --> 00:16:17.216
<v Marwan Altaie>You could get a payment in you don't know
what it's for,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/119-2
00:16:17.216 --> 00:16:21.043
<v Marwan Altaie>it gets returned to the client.
That's potentially a route for every</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/119-3
00:16:21.043 --> 00:16:21.432
<v Marwan Altaie>region.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/120-0
00:16:23.592 --> 00:16:27.615
<v Marwan Altaie>There are just other options in certain
other countries,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/120-1
00:16:27.615 --> 00:16:30.932
<v Marwan Altaie>so the other regions that's their only
option.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/120-2
00:16:30.932 --> 00:16:36.719
<v Marwan Altaie>That's one of two options in the UK and
that's one of three options in Australia,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/120-3
00:16:36.719 --> 00:16:37.072
<v Marwan Altaie>yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/121-0
00:16:41.832 --> 00:16:47.078
<v Marwan Altaie>So just to confirm,
Australia has part allocate Spence and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/121-1
00:16:47.078 --> 00:16:51.792
<v Marwan Altaie>transfer and Refund UK has just allocate
and reject.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/122-0
00:16:53.192 --> 00:16:54.672
<v Marwan Altaie>Trying to understand the decision plus.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/123-0
00:16:53.392 --> 00:16:56.139
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>No, that's that's that's not correct.
In the UK,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/123-1
00:16:56.139 --> 00:17:00.401
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we can also transfer money from the
office account to the client account if</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/123-2
00:17:00.401 --> 00:17:04.270
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we don't know what the funds are for or
if we have to part allocate.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/123-3
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:08.363
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We would rather than put it into a
suspense account that like they do in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/123-4
00:17:08.363 --> 00:17:11.166
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Australia,
we would move it to the client account</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/123-5
00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:12.232
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>and allocate it to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/124-0
00:17:12.952 --> 00:17:14.632
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>The specific matter that it relates to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/126-0
00:17:22.512 --> 00:17:26.541
<v Marwan Altaie>So not sure how best to do this.
Then we can do it from a general</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/126-1
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:31.364
<v Marwan Altaie>perspective and then do routing based on
region potentially and decision paths</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/126-2
00:17:31.364 --> 00:17:34.844
<v Marwan Altaie>based on region.
It will be difficult to kind of account</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/126-3
00:17:34.844 --> 00:17:39.790
<v Marwan Altaie>for every scenario and if it is a case of
this certain scenarios where it's very</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/126-4
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.232
<v Marwan Altaie>rare occurrence or one in every hundred.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/127-0
00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:45.561
<v Marwan Altaie>But I think you know again this is for
you to input.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/127-1
00:17:45.561 --> 00:17:49.730
<v Marwan Altaie>It would be slightly more difficult if we
want to account for that,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/127-2
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:54.756
<v Marwan Altaie>we can do the 80% scenarios and then have
as part of the process as a part of the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/127-3
00:17:54.756 --> 00:17:59.232
<v Marwan Altaie>documentation accounting for the more
nuanced or the regional variances.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/128-0
00:18:00.592 --> 00:18:05.272
<v Marwan Altaie>I think the, sadly the regional,
certainly Australia are more common than</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/128-1
00:18:05.272 --> 00:18:08.624
<v Marwan Altaie>you think,
but they're they're all options are quite</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/128-2
00:18:08.624 --> 00:18:09.952
<v Marwan Altaie>they happen a lot so.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/129-0
00:18:11.592 --> 00:18:15.616
<v Marwan Altaie>I wonder if we're better just getting to
one region at a time maybe and just going</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/129-1
00:18:15.616 --> 00:18:19.253
<v Marwan Altaie>to the options for that region,
would that be? Yeah, let's do that 'cause.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/129-2
00:18:19.253 --> 00:18:21.823
<v Marwan Altaie>I think otherwise,
we're gonna end up going from one</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/129-3
00:18:21.823 --> 00:18:24.927
<v Marwan Altaie>divergent to the other.
And we know I'm just trying to think if</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/129-4
00:18:24.927 --> 00:18:28.951
<v Marwan Altaie>it's worth trying to capture all of those
different variances rather than having a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/129-5
00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:30.552
<v Marwan Altaie>standard model that you can then.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/130-0
00:18:31.112 --> 00:18:33.515
<v Marwan Altaie>Action as you need to once it's based in
this particular region,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/130-1
00:18:33.515 --> 00:18:36.547
<v Marwan Altaie>you know once it's assigned to a certain
team and they can actually how they need</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/130-2
00:18:36.547 --> 00:18:37.472
<v Marwan Altaie>to rather than trying to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/131-0
00:18:39.232 --> 00:18:42.793
<v Marwan Altaie>Build and just to understand is that high
frequency is a high volume that you're</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/131-1
00:18:42.793 --> 00:18:44.112
<v Marwan Altaie>likely to get through as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/132-0
00:18:45.432 --> 00:18:47.641
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, 'cause,
then we we potentially have lots of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/132-1
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:51.131
<v Marwan Altaie>different variances that we need to kind
of account for as well. Yeah, 'cause,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/132-2
00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:54.533
<v Marwan Altaie>if you think that's how many receipts we
get into each bank account for each</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/132-3
00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:57.139
<v Marwan Altaie>country each day.
Now obviously not every receipt is going</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/132-4
00:18:57.139 --> 00:18:59.127
<v Marwan Altaie>to be unknown,
but you potentially you know.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/132-5
00:18:59.127 --> 00:19:01.910
<v Marwan Altaie>But then for example,
you can have a very long list of unknown</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/132-6
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.192
<v Marwan Altaie>payments. So it varies, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/133-0
00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:11.152
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. OK, then let's do region by region.
Cool. Let's start with Australia.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/134-0
00:19:13.832 --> 00:19:17.717
<v Marwan Altaie>How do we document this as we go through?
I'm just going to make notes and then</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/134-1
00:19:17.717 --> 00:19:20.630
<v Marwan Altaie>afterwards we have the recording and then
we can follow up.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/134-2
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.398
<v Marwan Altaie>We'll send you the user cases.
If there's any questions,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/134-3
00:19:23.398 --> 00:19:26.312
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll just follow up on anything. OK,
cool how it comes in.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/135-0
00:19:28.112 --> 00:19:30.763
<v Marwan Altaie>Into Australia,
we know what it's going to be allocated</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/135-1
00:19:30.763 --> 00:19:34.740
<v Marwan Altaie>against the credit control team will tell
the cashiers what to allocate it against.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/135-2
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.592
<v Marwan Altaie>Job done for good.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/136-0
00:19:38.312 --> 00:19:42.213
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry, I've missed a step. No, that's OK.
So received payment.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/136-1
00:19:42.213 --> 00:19:47.353
<v Marwan Altaie>Cashiers can either receipt based off the
information reports that we have or they</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/136-2
00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:50.574
<v Marwan Altaie>can't receipt.
And then that becomes an unallocated</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/136-3
00:19:50.574 --> 00:19:52.432
<v Marwan Altaie>report sent to credit control.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/137-0
00:19:55.272 --> 00:19:59.529
<v Marwan Altaie>So credit control will get that list of
unknown unallocated payments and they</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/137-1
00:19:59.529 --> 00:20:03.842
<v Marwan Altaie>will either know what those payments are
for which case they will let cashiers</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/137-2
00:20:03.842 --> 00:20:06.352
<v Marwan Altaie>know and say, yeah,
this is what it's paying.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/137-3
00:20:06.352 --> 00:20:10.392
<v Marwan Altaie>Then cashiers will apply it and that's
that's all good. Proceeded closed.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/138-0
00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:17.206
<v Marwan Altaie>Where they don't know what it's paying.
This is where there is further</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/138-1
00:20:17.206 --> 00:20:21.585
<v Marwan Altaie>investigation.
That investigation may involve phoning up</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/138-2
00:20:21.585 --> 00:20:27.961
<v Marwan Altaie>a client and asking what the payments for
it may involve going out to a partner or</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/138-3
00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:28.192
<v Marwan Altaie>PE.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/139-0
00:20:28.552 --> 00:20:32.666
<v Marwan Altaie>To ask a question by what else do we do?
We might ask cashiers For more</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/139-1
00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:35.637
<v Marwan Altaie>information.
Do you have any other information from</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/139-2
00:20:35.637 --> 00:20:38.552
<v Marwan Altaie>the bank?
Anything else that you think might help?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/141-0
00:20:41.712 --> 00:20:46.500
<v Marwan Altaie>They also missing.
It might just be that an invoice has been</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/141-1
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.032
<v Marwan Altaie>reversed and nothing's been issued
reissued.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/142-0
00:20:51.912 --> 00:20:56.470
<v Marwan Altaie>Sometimes it's conversation with partners,
sometimes it's not. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/142-1
00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.764
<v Marwan Altaie>it could be a payments receipt for 100,
000 to for two invoices.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/142-2
00:21:00.764 --> 00:21:06.380
<v Marwan Altaie>One of the invoices has already been paid
before, so we can't apply all the payment.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/142-3
00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.032
<v Marwan Altaie>It's quite a few reasons.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/143-0
00:21:08.552 --> 00:21:11.619
<v Marwan Altaie>It's really support, but I think, yeah,
let's check.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/143-1
00:21:11.619 --> 00:21:16.190
<v Marwan Altaie>Do you do you need to report those types
of types of I'll just call it kind of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/143-2
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.232
<v Marwan Altaie>investigations or.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/144-0
00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:23.715
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes, we should.
We should keep an audit of what is</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/144-1
00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:28.653
<v Marwan Altaie>allocated to what based on the feedback
that we've given, yes, we should,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/144-2
00:21:28.653 --> 00:21:34.192
<v Marwan Altaie>it's probably more relevant in Australia
for suspense. Unallocated accounts, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/145-0
00:21:34.672 --> 00:21:40.053
<v Marwan Altaie>Because we are audited on those accounts
to make sure that we are doing our due</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/145-1
00:21:40.053 --> 00:21:45.502
<v Marwan Altaie>diligence and making sure we are not just
using them and dumping accounts. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/145-2
00:21:45.502 --> 00:21:50.748
<v Marwan Altaie>like a it can could also be helpful to
add some more substance to our reverse</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/145-3
00:21:50.748 --> 00:21:54.112
<v Marwan Altaie>invoices reports that you're doing Chris
because.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/146-0
00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:58.293
<v Marwan Altaie>Right now,
we're not really capturing how many of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/146-1
00:21:58.293 --> 00:22:03.067
<v Marwan Altaie>our reversed invoices we're receiving
payment for as well that we're having to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/146-2
00:22:03.067 --> 00:22:03.672
<v Marwan Altaie>deal with.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/148-0
00:22:05.912 --> 00:22:10.046
<v Marwan Altaie>Because that if we're receiving payment
from a client for an invoice that's been</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/148-1
00:22:10.046 --> 00:22:12.496
<v Marwan Altaie>reversed,
it means that the PS and partners are</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/148-2
00:22:12.496 --> 00:22:15.661
<v Marwan Altaie>missing a step and not sending a credit
note onto the client.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/148-3
00:22:15.661 --> 00:22:19.846
<v Marwan Altaie>Or they're sending a credit note onto the
client who's not giving that onto their</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/148-4
00:22:19.846 --> 00:22:22.245
<v Marwan Altaie>AP team.
There's a breakdown in communications</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/148-5
00:22:22.245 --> 00:22:24.032
<v Marwan Altaie>somewhere on the along those lines.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/149-0
00:22:24.432 --> 00:22:28.748
<v Marwan Altaie>That means that the client is just
wasting their time,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/149-1
00:22:28.748 --> 00:22:30.632
<v Marwan Altaie>basically double paying.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/150-0
00:22:33.552 --> 00:22:34.472
<v Marwan Altaie>Are these?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/151-0
00:22:36.312 --> 00:22:40.855
<v Marwan Altaie>Processes specifically related to this or
these processes that kind of sit adjacent</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/151-1
00:22:40.855 --> 00:22:43.397
<v Marwan Altaie>that we need to improve on.
They sit adjacent,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/151-2
00:22:43.397 --> 00:22:47.724
<v Marwan Altaie>they don't sit within our process. So OK,
just for this it's it's a good point,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/151-3
00:22:47.724 --> 00:22:52.104
<v Marwan Altaie>but just for the sake of because it's
already a quite complex different regions.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/151-4
00:22:52.104 --> 00:22:55.512
<v Marwan Altaie>If if we just put this as a parking lot
and we can pick it up.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/152-0
00:22:55.672 --> 00:22:58.749
<v Marwan Altaie>Call you later? Yeah, you got that? Yeah.
Cool. Thank you. So,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/152-1
00:22:58.749 --> 00:23:02.216
<v Marwan Altaie>back to the easy Australia process.
Do you wanna continue to do? Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/152-2
00:23:02.216 --> 00:23:05.879
<v Marwan Altaie>that's the easy one. This is the.
This is the slightly more difficult one.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/152-3
00:23:05.879 --> 00:23:08.565
<v Marwan Altaie>So we've got a payment in,
we know what half of it is.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/152-4
00:23:08.565 --> 00:23:11.495
<v Marwan Altaie>We don't know what the other half of it
is. It's month end.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/152-5
00:23:11.495 --> 00:23:12.912
<v Marwan Altaie>I want that cash in the bank.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/153-0
00:23:13.432 --> 00:23:18.335
<v Marwan Altaie>So we will post half the receipt against
the invoice that we know and we will</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/153-1
00:23:18.335 --> 00:23:21.352
<v Marwan Altaie>leave half the receipt in the suspense
account.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/154-0
00:23:22.792 --> 00:23:27.634
<v Marwan Altaie>And suspense account will sit there and
the credit the Australian credit control</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/154-1
00:23:27.634 --> 00:23:31.340
<v Marwan Altaie>team will get that item assigned to them
in suspense account.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/154-2
00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:36.003
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's like 6 in an Excel spreadsheet
and it will be their responsibility to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/154-3
00:23:36.003 --> 00:23:38.992
<v Marwan Altaie>follow up on that try and identify where
it goes.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/155-0
00:23:41.832 --> 00:23:45.173
<v Marwan Altaie>That following up could be anything from
contacting a client, contacting APE,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/155-1
00:23:45.173 --> 00:23:47.529
<v Marwan Altaie>contacting a partner,
whatever it would be any sort of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/155-2
00:23:47.529 --> 00:23:49.072
<v Marwan Altaie>investigation that needs to be done.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/156-0
00:23:51.472 --> 00:23:55.905
<v Marwan Altaie>If they can't work out where the money or
where their remaining balance is to be</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/156-1
00:23:55.905 --> 00:23:58.587
<v Marwan Altaie>posted,
then they need to contact the client and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/156-2
00:23:58.587 --> 00:24:00.832
<v Marwan Altaie>say we need to return this amount to you.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/157-0
00:24:02.312 --> 00:24:05.752
<v Marwan Altaie>And that will then trigger the refund
process, which is another, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/158-0
00:24:07.912 --> 00:24:11.032
<v Marwan Altaie>I'll turn it, move it into trust.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/159-0
00:24:12.312 --> 00:24:16.963
<v Marwan Altaie>However, we have a small window,
a window about two weeks maybe pushing it</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/159-1
00:24:16.963 --> 00:24:22.049
<v Marwan Altaie>at 3:00 to move that money from suspense
into the trust account just based on our</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/159-2
00:24:22.049 --> 00:24:24.778
<v Marwan Altaie>audit requirements.
Because if we leave it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/159-3
00:24:24.778 --> 00:24:29.616
<v Marwan Altaie>if we've got the balance sitting on
suspense for four months and then we move</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/159-4
00:24:29.616 --> 00:24:30.112
<v Marwan Altaie>it into.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/160-0
00:24:30.792 --> 00:24:36.031
<v Marwan Altaie>The trust accounts in order to see that
that's too long.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/160-1
00:24:36.031 --> 00:24:43.018
<v Marwan Altaie>And then that money has isn't wasn't
actually received as funds in advance.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/160-2
00:24:43.018 --> 00:24:45.592
<v Marwan Altaie>So we've got that nuance it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/161-0
00:24:47.072 --> 00:24:51.220
<v Marwan Altaie>The UK Martin correct if I'm wrong,
the UK have the option.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/161-1
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:56.682
<v Marwan Altaie>Well generally would prefer to move money
from their unallocated directly into</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/161-2
00:24:56.682 --> 00:25:01.867
<v Marwan Altaie>their client accounts as soon as possible.
One well mostly because of SRA,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/161-3
00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:03.872
<v Marwan Altaie>but second because they have.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/162-0
00:25:04.152 --> 00:25:09.002
<v Marwan Altaie>Because the regulations they have the
ability to just confirm with the client</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/162-1
00:25:09.002 --> 00:25:13.914
<v Marwan Altaie>they are allocating that those funds to
the next invoice that can be raised or</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/162-2
00:25:13.914 --> 00:25:17.831
<v Marwan Altaie>can be billed Australia require client
authorization to do so.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/162-3
00:25:17.831 --> 00:25:22.681
<v Marwan Altaie>So we can't move money in and out of
trust our trust accounts as freely as we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/162-4
00:25:22.681 --> 00:25:23.552
<v Marwan Altaie>would like to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/163-0
00:25:25.032 --> 00:25:29.725
<v Marwan Altaie>I should say it's probably less common in
Australia to get money for bills into</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/163-1
00:25:29.725 --> 00:25:32.600
<v Marwan Altaie>trust as well.
It happens quite a lot in the UK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/163-2
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.472
<v Marwan Altaie>It doesn't as much in Australia does
happen, just not very often.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/164-0
00:25:39.272 --> 00:25:43.432
<v Marwan Altaie>The suspense is client money,
but not in trust.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/165-0
00:25:46.992 --> 00:25:49.146
<v Marwan Altaie>Are we saying the trigger for that as
well?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/165-1
00:25:49.146 --> 00:25:53.258
<v Marwan Altaie>We need to have explicit instruction from
the client in order to move from suspense</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/165-2
00:25:53.258 --> 00:25:55.706
<v Marwan Altaie>to trust? Yes,
because then they have to give the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/165-3
00:25:55.706 --> 00:25:59.623
<v Marwan Altaie>explicit instruction to move to lift that
money out of trust towards something.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/165-4
00:25:59.623 --> 00:26:01.973
<v Marwan Altaie>Mm-hmm.
But if they move it to if we move it to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/165-5
00:26:01.973 --> 00:26:02.952
<v Marwan Altaie>trust, it has to be.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/166-0
00:26:03.592 --> 00:26:06.419
<v Marwan Altaie>Within,
within a certain window of time otherwise,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/166-1
00:26:06.419 --> 00:26:10.355
<v Marwan Altaie>but from the auditor's perspective,
it's not seen as money received in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/166-2
00:26:10.355 --> 00:26:13.072
<v Marwan Altaie>advance of legal fees,
and then we get breached.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/167-0
00:26:14.552 --> 00:26:17.366
<v Marwan Altaie>OK,
so this seems to kick off a lot of the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/167-1
00:26:17.366 --> 00:26:22.341
<v Marwan Altaie>other processes that I've documented.
I just wanna double check that. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/167-2
00:26:22.341 --> 00:26:23.192
<v Marwan Altaie>the other so.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/168-0
00:26:26.232 --> 00:26:29.487
<v Marwan Altaie>If we take a step back,
this is essentially your kick off process</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/168-1
00:26:29.487 --> 00:26:32.496
<v Marwan Altaie>for your sub processes.
Do we want to map out each different</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/168-2
00:26:32.496 --> 00:26:36.541
<v Marwan Altaie>scenario or would it be easier to map out
what picks off these processes and then</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/168-3
00:26:36.541 --> 00:26:40.635
<v Marwan Altaie>once we get into these individual then we
raise the nuances that might be slightly</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/168-4
00:26:40.635 --> 00:26:43.052
<v Marwan Altaie>easier.
Otherwise we're doing this whole process</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/168-5
00:26:43.052 --> 00:26:43.792
<v Marwan Altaie>to this extent.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/169-0
00:26:44.352 --> 00:26:47.224
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. Yeah.
So if we just focus what kicks off cache</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/169-1
00:26:47.224 --> 00:26:49.826
<v Marwan Altaie>collection,
what kicks off unallocated and then</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/169-2
00:26:49.826 --> 00:26:52.915
<v Marwan Altaie>segment it like that?
Just if we can go with that logic,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/169-3
00:26:52.915 --> 00:26:57.305
<v Marwan Altaie>if we can just do unallocated account and
double check that does align with what</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/169-4
00:26:57.305 --> 00:27:00.232
<v Marwan Altaie>you've just discussed in terms of the
four scenarios.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/171-0
00:27:01.552 --> 00:27:04.828
<v Marwan Altaie>From the sound of things,
this does get to the granularity that you</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/171-1
00:27:04.828 --> 00:27:07.141
<v Marwan Altaie>need,
so I just want to see if that does align.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/171-2
00:27:07.141 --> 00:27:10.900
<v Marwan Altaie>So this is I think based on the e-mail,
you also confirmed this is purely for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/171-3
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.984
<v Marwan Altaie>Australia. Yeah, cool.
So we'll we'll jump back to the previous</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/171-4
00:27:13.984 --> 00:27:16.104
<v Marwan Altaie>one,
but I just want to make sure that this</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/171-5
00:27:16.104 --> 00:27:19.911
<v Marwan Altaie>does align so that way we can fragment
the processes and it'll be a bit easier</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/171-6
00:27:19.911 --> 00:27:20.152
<v Marwan Altaie>then.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/172-0
00:27:20.832 --> 00:27:24.266
<v Marwan Altaie>On a larger scale,
so bank receive can't be matched to an</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/172-1
00:27:24.266 --> 00:27:27.167
<v Marwan Altaie>invoice.
Your handoffs are cashier unidentifiers</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/172-2
00:27:27.167 --> 00:27:31.666
<v Marwan Altaie>identifies the unallocated payment,
credit control reviews payment provides</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/172-3
00:27:31.666 --> 00:27:35.752
<v Marwan Altaie>allocation information, partner approval,
and then cashier finishes.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/173-0
00:27:36.152 --> 00:27:41.494
<v Marwan Altaie>In terms of your decision making,
the four that we just highlighted now,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/173-1
00:27:41.494 --> 00:27:45.226
<v Marwan Altaie>so you've got your full parts return and
transfer.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/173-2
00:27:45.226 --> 00:27:49.617
<v Marwan Altaie>And does this align with what you were
just describing? OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/173-3
00:27:49.617 --> 00:27:52.032
<v Marwan Altaie>So in terms of kind of workflows?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/174-0
00:27:52.752 --> 00:27:55.222
<v Marwan Altaie>I'd imagine,
and this is solutionizing a little bit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/174-1
00:27:55.222 --> 00:27:59.119
<v Marwan Altaie>what we just described at the beginning
would then kick off one of these and then</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/174-2
00:27:59.119 --> 00:28:01.780
<v Marwan Altaie>we'd route it down the path of, OK,
it's been approved.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/174-3
00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.438
<v Marwan Altaie>So you'd have a slightly smaller workflow
and then it would kick off the big</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/174-4
00:28:05.438 --> 00:28:08.432
<v Marwan Altaie>transfer move to suspense full for cash
allocation end to end.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/175-0
00:28:10.712 --> 00:28:13.472
<v Marwan Altaie>This will be simpler to kind of break
that up within the system.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/176-0
00:28:14.792 --> 00:28:19.359
<v Marwan Altaie>Does that mean depending on what type of
allocation comes back? Mm-hmm,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/176-1
00:28:19.359 --> 00:28:22.531
<v Marwan Altaie>we would be creating a little subtask
underneath.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/176-2
00:28:22.531 --> 00:28:26.782
<v Marwan Altaie>We could potentially also also create
that based on the selection.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/176-3
00:28:26.782 --> 00:28:30.905
<v Marwan Altaie>So you can create a subtask.
So say a transfer I know is its own</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/176-4
00:28:30.905 --> 00:28:32.872
<v Marwan Altaie>process. So transfer to client.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/177-0
00:28:33.112 --> 00:28:37.346
<v Marwan Altaie>You selected that that's the end decision.
It creates a subtask you allocated to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/177-1
00:28:37.346 --> 00:28:40.326
<v Marwan Altaie>your specific issue that needs to do the
action. Mm-hmm.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/177-2
00:28:40.326 --> 00:28:44.142
<v Marwan Altaie>And then you create their task,
and then they need to follow up and then</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/177-3
00:28:44.142 --> 00:28:47.435
<v Marwan Altaie>close the ticket. I mean,
there's something like client refund</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/177-4
00:28:47.435 --> 00:28:48.272
<v Marwan Altaie>where you could.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/178-0
00:28:48.752 --> 00:28:51.844
<v Marwan Altaie>And sub task assign it to your credit
controllers.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/178-1
00:28:51.844 --> 00:28:56.269
<v Marwan Altaie>They could provide that documentation
back and approval from you back to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/178-2
00:28:56.269 --> 00:29:00.634
<v Marwan Altaie>cashiers and then that's an action for us
to then process that payment.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/178-3
00:29:00.634 --> 00:29:04.272
<v Marwan Altaie>So we say we're going to put all this in
service, don't we?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/179-0
00:29:04.752 --> 00:29:10.038
<v Marwan Altaie>I think so. I think that we need to,
I think that would help the workflows a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/179-1
00:29:10.038 --> 00:29:13.952
<v Marwan Altaie>lot 'cause they get lost in sharewell
really easily, OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/180-0
00:29:15.592 --> 00:29:18.928
<v Marwan Altaie>So there's sorry,
I just don't know if I'm missing a little</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/180-1
00:29:18.928 --> 00:29:21.320
<v Marwan Altaie>bit.
So there's all the money always comes</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/180-2
00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.545
<v Marwan Altaie>into Cash, Eden,
and then it only comes to credit control</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/180-3
00:29:24.545 --> 00:29:27.104
<v Marwan Altaie>when it's unallocated.
That's the first part.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/180-4
00:29:27.104 --> 00:29:30.552
<v Marwan Altaie>So that's definitely just tasked between
you guys then, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/181-0
00:29:30.832 --> 00:29:31.072
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/182-0
00:29:32.792 --> 00:29:33.872
<v Marwan Altaie>And depending on.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/183-0
00:29:35.472 --> 00:29:39.132
<v Marwan Altaie>Where you are in the world and what
you're going to do with that money will</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/183-1
00:29:39.132 --> 00:29:42.793
<v Marwan Altaie>depend on the next action. Yeah. Sorry.
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense to me.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/183-2
00:29:42.793 --> 00:29:46.358
<v Marwan Altaie>I just wondered if I was totally
oversimplified. Isn't that simple? Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/183-3
00:29:46.358 --> 00:29:48.862
<v Marwan Altaie>No, it's. Yeah.
It's the bit after that gets really</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/183-4
00:29:48.862 --> 00:29:51.512
<v Marwan Altaie>complicated trying to work out what's in
what country.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/184-0
00:29:52.312 --> 00:29:56.785
<v Marwan Altaie>The receding trigger for cashiers is the
bank statement on a daily basis,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/184-1
00:29:56.785 --> 00:30:01.560
<v Marwan Altaie>which is why we had didn't include it
last week because there's no trigger for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/184-2
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.978
<v Marwan Altaie>us,
the trigger is to credit control to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/184-3
00:30:03.978 --> 00:30:05.792
<v Marwan Altaie>action stuff that we can't do.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/185-0
00:30:07.072 --> 00:30:11.752
<v Marwan Altaie>So what process is it in cashier in that
would then?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/186-0
00:30:13.392 --> 00:30:17.090
<v Marwan Altaie>Kick off this if that makes sense,
so you'll get money. And what?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/186-1
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:21.180
<v Marwan Altaie>What process is it that sits in cash?
You cash receipts and then if it's</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/186-2
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:25.102
<v Marwan Altaie>allocated and you know what's happening,
you just process that money.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/186-3
00:30:25.102 --> 00:30:28.912
<v Marwan Altaie>It then only trips over to credit control
when we don't know. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/187-0
00:30:29.392 --> 00:30:31.818
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. OK.
So it's cash receipt and Isabella from</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/187-1
00:30:31.818 --> 00:30:34.592
<v Marwan Altaie>it's cash receipting process and the cash
earning team,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/187-2
00:30:34.592 --> 00:30:37.662
<v Marwan Altaie>that's the one we need to be looking at,
yeah or off the off.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/187-3
00:30:37.662 --> 00:30:40.980
<v Marwan Altaie>The account receipts will be under of
this account receipts, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/187-4
00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.655
<v Marwan Altaie>Or partnership account,
I don't know whatever you're,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/187-5
00:30:43.655 --> 00:30:46.032
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean anything that says receipts is
relevant.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/188-0
00:30:47.312 --> 00:30:50.610
<v Marwan Altaie>This is also probably one of those assets
with Deborah and Josh.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/188-1
00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:54.770
<v Marwan Altaie>So I'd need to align it with the process.
So this is the whole intent part. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/188-2
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.206
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.
So it makes it difficult to kind of fully</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/188-3
00:30:57.206 --> 00:31:00.758
<v Marwan Altaie>create it without their input.
So that's why I'm trying to understand</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/188-4
00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:03.904
<v Marwan Altaie>your specific to be fair in our cashier's
workshop last week,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/188-5
00:31:03.904 --> 00:31:05.832
<v Marwan Altaie>we did not have the office receipting.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/190-0
00:31:06.512 --> 00:31:12.309
<v Marwan Altaie>As an item on service like on our
ServiceNow work stop because there's the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/190-1
00:31:12.309 --> 00:31:18.106
<v Marwan Altaie>workflow like there's no trigger for us.
There's no requests that come in.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/190-2
00:31:18.106 --> 00:31:22.512
<v Marwan Altaie>There's nothing for us to actually kind
of click action.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/191-0
00:31:23.712 --> 00:31:28.285
<v Marwan Altaie>We're going off bank statements and
remain devices. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/191-1
00:31:28.285 --> 00:31:33.726
<v Marwan Altaie>So we kind of we mentioned it,
but that's we kind of moved that this</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/191-2
00:31:33.726 --> 00:31:40.192
<v Marwan Altaie>process to credit control because I've
said the only action that needs to happen.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/192-0
00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:43.791
<v Marwan Altaie>Comes from any payments that we can't
allocate,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/192-1
00:31:43.791 --> 00:31:48.596
<v Marwan Altaie>which means that we become the requester.
Yeah. To credit control. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/192-2
00:31:48.596 --> 00:31:52.940
<v Marwan Altaie>Credit control to then do their action to
follow up. Investigate.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/192-3
00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.112
<v Marwan Altaie>Send instructions back to us. OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/193-0
00:31:55.312 --> 00:31:57.775
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>I would say there's a a large percentage,
excuse me,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/193-1
00:31:57.775 --> 00:32:01.725
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>a large percentage of the seats we do get,
we don't have to go to credit control for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/193-2
00:32:01.725 --> 00:32:05.072
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>because we do get remittance advices and
stuff like that. So it's just.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/195-0
00:32:06.912 --> 00:32:10.072
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>I've seen a bit 20% of what receipts come
in for the UK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/194-0
00:32:07.472 --> 00:32:07.712
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/195-1
00:32:10.072 --> 00:32:13.232
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We are reaching out to credit control for
other systems.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/196-0
00:32:12.912 --> 00:32:16.399
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. Yeah. Outside. Yeah,
that's probably under 27. Global,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/196-1
00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:21.029
<v Marwan Altaie>actually. Yeah. Yeah. So you're saying,
Anna, that if you've got an unallocated,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/196-2
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:25.145
<v Marwan Altaie>you would go into the portal,
you would raise this or you'd raise it on</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/196-3
00:32:25.145 --> 00:32:27.832
<v Marwan Altaie>the back end. Either way,
you'd be raising it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/197-0
00:32:28.392 --> 00:32:32.609
<v Marwan Altaie>To credit control, yes, correct. OK,
so it's not a task coming off another</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/197-1
00:32:32.609 --> 00:32:36.882
<v Marwan Altaie>process that you're running. No,
it's a new one. OK. So right, kick it off.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/197-2
00:32:36.882 --> 00:32:39.357
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah,
right now if we're thinking about our</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/197-3
00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:43.068
<v Marwan Altaie>current as is process,
there's no tickets that come across shell.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/197-4
00:32:43.068 --> 00:32:45.992
<v Marwan Altaie>There's nothing in shell.
Well for us for this the.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/198-0
00:32:46.872 --> 00:32:49.788
<v Marwan Altaie>If credit control were in Sharewell as
well,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/198-1
00:32:49.788 --> 00:32:54.648
<v Marwan Altaie>their ticket would be received by
cashiers because we would send an e-mail</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/198-2
00:32:54.648 --> 00:32:59.184
<v Marwan Altaie>to say we've received 100 ticket,
100 transactions and these six need</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/198-3
00:32:59.184 --> 00:33:04.239
<v Marwan Altaie>allocating here and that's what would
create a ticket in sharewell for either</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/198-4
00:33:04.239 --> 00:33:04.952
<v Marwan Altaie>team, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/199-0
00:33:06.032 --> 00:33:08.211
<v Marwan Altaie>Martin,
is that the same for you in Glasgow?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/199-1
00:33:08.211 --> 00:33:11.312
<v Marwan Altaie>Do you not run your receipt process
through sharewell just now?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/200-0
00:33:11.272 --> 00:33:14.685
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We we would just send an e-mail from
Shellville Joe.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/200-1
00:33:14.685 --> 00:33:17.712
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We would just create a ticket ourselves,
yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/201-0
00:33:15.432 --> 00:33:17.553
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.
And that's how you would characterise</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/201-1
00:33:17.553 --> 00:33:20.398
<v Marwan Altaie>which is the same thing we're going to do
here. Basically,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/201-2
00:33:20.398 --> 00:33:22.953
<v Marwan Altaie>you'll do your work that you need to do
in receipts,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/201-3
00:33:22.953 --> 00:33:26.521
<v Marwan Altaie>and then you're basically just creating a
task to come to you guys. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/201-4
00:33:26.521 --> 00:33:30.523
<v Marwan Altaie>So it would rather would do that instead
of sending you an e-mail. Can I just ask?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/201-5
00:33:30.523 --> 00:33:31.632
<v Marwan Altaie>This might be a secret.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/202-0
00:33:32.592 --> 00:33:35.653
<v Marwan Altaie>When you when these requests come in,
so at the moment you, Stephen,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/202-1
00:33:35.653 --> 00:33:37.694
<v Marwan Altaie>when you get a list of an allocated
payments,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/202-2
00:33:37.694 --> 00:33:40.578
<v Marwan Altaie>just get listed like 10 of them say off
you go. Yeah. So we get.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/202-3
00:33:40.578 --> 00:33:42.663
<v Marwan Altaie>So you would just raise one request would
you?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/202-4
00:33:42.663 --> 00:33:46.035
<v Marwan Altaie>Now the problem being is that those 10
requests might sit with 10 different</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/202-5
00:33:46.035 --> 00:33:49.408
<v Marwan Altaie>credit controllers. So what do you do?
Do you then just split out all those</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/202-6
00:33:49.408 --> 00:33:50.872
<v Marwan Altaie>tasks to write credit controller?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/203-0
00:33:51.192 --> 00:33:52.872
<v Marwan Altaie>How does that work? Just.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/204-0
00:33:56.312 --> 00:33:59.031
<v Marwan Altaie>What happens if the credit controller is?
Well,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/204-1
00:33:59.031 --> 00:34:03.337
<v Marwan Altaie>not by the scene as as one of their
accounts they've seen every day so that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/204-2
00:34:03.337 --> 00:34:06.396
<v Marwan Altaie>they get ownership all.
So there's one person update,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/204-3
00:34:06.396 --> 00:34:10.249
<v Marwan Altaie>master report anyone type.
So they'd have intended to open the same</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/204-4
00:34:10.249 --> 00:34:11.552
<v Marwan Altaie>document as one person.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/205-0
00:34:12.272 --> 00:34:15.786
<v Marwan Altaie>Just probably 1 senior in Australia
doesn't work to do so.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/205-1
00:34:15.786 --> 00:34:20.730
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean you could align it with your rotor
that you have of your team going through</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/205-2
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:25.495
<v Marwan Altaie>that unallocated suspense anyway. Yeah.
So you have a rotor and then you recite</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/205-3
00:34:25.495 --> 00:34:28.116
<v Marwan Altaie>it out.
If you've got multiple items in one</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/205-4
00:34:28.116 --> 00:34:31.512
<v Marwan Altaie>ticket and you need to if you have a
request that comes.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/206-0
00:34:31.632 --> 00:34:34.220
<v Marwan Altaie>In and it's got multiple items in that
request,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/206-1
00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.862
<v Marwan Altaie>but it looks as though it's just one to
someone.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/206-2
00:34:36.862 --> 00:34:38.912
<v Marwan Altaie>Can you then split those out into sub?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/207-0
00:34:40.392 --> 00:34:43.714
<v Marwan Altaie>Requests doesn't make sense like so
you've got 10 receipts, for example. OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/207-1
00:34:43.714 --> 00:34:46.216
<v Marwan Altaie>And I know that there's ten different
credit controllers.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/207-2
00:34:46.216 --> 00:34:49.409
<v Marwan Altaie>Each one were responsible for those
receipts of finding out the equation,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/207-3
00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:52.473
<v Marwan Altaie>and they might root separately.
There might be a different tasks to do</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/207-4
00:34:52.473 --> 00:34:55.752
<v Marwan Altaie>with everyone. How does that work?
So that request comes in for 10 of them.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/208-0
00:34:55.992 --> 00:35:00.527
<v Marwan Altaie>Comes into the credit control.
So are we saying we give on the front end</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/208-1
00:35:00.527 --> 00:35:03.447
<v Marwan Altaie>form?
Are you saying we'd have a line item for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/208-2
00:35:03.447 --> 00:35:06.677
<v Marwan Altaie>each one? Well,
I'm saying what you're saying is an</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/208-3
00:35:06.677 --> 00:35:10.715
<v Marwan Altaie>attachment. Yeah. Invoice.
I think we're just checking to see if</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/208-4
00:35:10.715 --> 00:35:12.952
<v Marwan Altaie>cashiers would create one task with.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/209-0
00:35:13.472 --> 00:35:15.996
<v Marwan Altaie>All unallocated items,
and if that's the case,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/209-1
00:35:15.996 --> 00:35:19.863
<v Marwan Altaie>then how would that look for credit
control when they have to split the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/209-2
00:35:19.863 --> 00:35:22.226
<v Marwan Altaie>separate transactions out amongst
multiple?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/209-3
00:35:22.226 --> 00:35:26.631
<v Marwan Altaie>I think if you could controllers by line
item you could create let's say 10 tasks</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/209-4
00:35:26.631 --> 00:35:28.672
<v Marwan Altaie>and they can be individually assigned.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/210-0
00:35:29.032 --> 00:35:31.276
<v Marwan Altaie>Within the press itself,
do you do it just now?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/210-1
00:35:31.276 --> 00:35:34.176
<v Marwan Altaie>So you had an e-mail with a spreadsheet
on it, I guess. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/210-2
00:35:34.176 --> 00:35:37.449
<v Marwan Altaie>You got one e-mail with it,
spreadsheet on it and everything's on it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/210-3
00:35:37.449 --> 00:35:40.816
<v Marwan Altaie>And then what happens to that spreadsheet
when it comes into your team?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/210-4
00:35:40.816 --> 00:35:43.809
<v Marwan Altaie>Does that go to one person and they work
through them? Yes. OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/210-5
00:35:43.809 --> 00:35:45.352
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's just the same thing then.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/211-0
00:35:45.992 --> 00:35:49.303
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, unless I'm misunderstanding. No.
But it's how do you divvy up a task?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/211-1
00:35:49.303 --> 00:35:52.571
<v Marwan Altaie>Because in an e-mail you could just send
around the e-mail to everyone and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/211-2
00:35:52.571 --> 00:35:55.490
<v Marwan Altaie>everyone picks up their own.
But if you've got a task, how do you?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/211-3
00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:58.975
<v Marwan Altaie>So what do you think about those tasks?
Because you'll do it by e-mail when you</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/211-4
00:35:58.975 --> 00:36:01.372
<v Marwan Altaie>do those tasks now,
so you can send a separate e-mail.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/211-5
00:36:01.372 --> 00:36:02.592
<v Marwan Altaie>You don't need to do it off.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/212-0
00:36:03.032 --> 00:36:05.518
<v Marwan Altaie>Whereas if you have a task,
how does that work?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/212-1
00:36:05.518 --> 00:36:08.368
<v Marwan Altaie>Because you're going to have potentially
some of them,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/212-2
00:36:08.368 --> 00:36:12.150
<v Marwan Altaie>you're going to refund something,
you're going to allocate some of them,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/212-3
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:15.621
<v Marwan Altaie>you're going to suspense.
How do you divvy up that one task unless</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/212-4
00:36:15.621 --> 00:36:19.092
<v Marwan Altaie>there's only one request comes up?
So you have one request per one</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/212-5
00:36:19.092 --> 00:36:22.512
<v Marwan Altaie>transaction. So that's your workflow,
is it not? Right. So we're.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/213-0
00:36:22.712 --> 00:36:27.776
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't know about two different things
here. We're talking about how it comes in.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/213-1
00:36:27.776 --> 00:36:32.108
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's one request from cashiers to
creative control. 10 items. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/213-2
00:36:32.108 --> 00:36:36.318
<v Marwan Altaie>with 10 items in a list on it.
What we're then talking about is how,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/213-3
00:36:36.318 --> 00:36:39.552
<v Marwan Altaie>if not all of those 10 items have the
same solution.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/214-0
00:36:40.112 --> 00:36:43.260
<v Marwan Altaie>How do we split those?
Is that what we're talking about? Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/214-1
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.759
<v Marwan Altaie>How do you, how do you assign that?
People. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/214-2
00:36:45.759 --> 00:36:49.557
<v Marwan Altaie>How do you assign it to a different
credit controller when you might have 3</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/214-3
00:36:49.557 --> 00:36:53.205
<v Marwan Altaie>transactions relating to one person,
two transactions to another person,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/214-4
00:36:53.205 --> 00:36:56.503
<v Marwan Altaie>and then the rest of the five,
five different credit controllers?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/214-5
00:36:56.503 --> 00:36:59.352
<v Marwan Altaie>And why are they not setting the same
credit controller?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/215-0
00:36:59.432 --> 00:37:01.916
<v Marwan Altaie>Or what is it that drives that?
Is it client?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/215-1
00:37:01.916 --> 00:37:04.778
<v Marwan Altaie>Any of your clients are Steven,
for example, Joseph,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/215-2
00:37:04.778 --> 00:37:08.559
<v Marwan Altaie>Goldman Sachs or any Goldman Sachs? Yeah.
OK, that makes sense. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/215-3
00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:12.232
<v Marwan Altaie>So I don't know the answer,
but I understand what the challenge is.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/217-0
00:37:12.152 --> 00:37:14.846
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Almost in my head,
it feels like there has to be a table</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/215-4
00:37:12.232 --> 00:37:13.312
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. So what we're.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/217-1
00:37:14.846 --> 00:37:18.201
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>that we complete in the cashier team and
it's like, what's the amount?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/216-0
00:37:16.192 --> 00:37:17.992
<v Marwan Altaie>It's like a matrix, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/217-2
00:37:18.201 --> 00:37:21.226
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Who's it came from? What's the reference?
And that's one entry.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/217-3
00:37:21.226 --> 00:37:24.913
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>And then we get the choice to then like
an add button to say that we've got a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/217-4
00:37:24.913 --> 00:37:28.552
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>second one and maybe each line can then
go off to see some individual credit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/217-5
00:37:28.552 --> 00:37:29.072
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>controller.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/219-0
00:37:29.592 --> 00:37:33.821
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>And they respond with further action that
needs to to happen after that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/219-1
00:37:33.821 --> 00:37:38.629
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>And it maybe just splits one request into
multiple requests because we're adding a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/219-2
00:37:38.629 --> 00:37:39.672
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>line for each one.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/220-0
00:37:40.352 --> 00:37:44.880
<v Marwan Altaie>So would you currently send an e-mail
with multiple clients on?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/220-1
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.550
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it a spreadsheet though?
Or is it a so are you manually typing</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/220-2
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:54.503
<v Marwan Altaie>that information into the e-mail?
In Australia we have a a shared doc</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/220-3
00:37:54.503 --> 00:37:59.032
<v Marwan Altaie>spreadsheet. Mm-hmm.
When there are unallocated items, we copy.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/221-0
00:37:59.432 --> 00:38:03.543
<v Marwan Altaie>All that information into the unallocated
spreadsheet that credit control have</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/221-1
00:38:03.543 --> 00:38:07.549
<v Marwan Altaie>access to as well. And then we copy.
We also do a copy of those transactions</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/221-2
00:38:07.549 --> 00:38:10.515
<v Marwan Altaie>into an e-mail.
So the e-mail goes out to credit all the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/221-3
00:38:10.515 --> 00:38:14.418
<v Marwan Altaie>individual credit controllers that these
are our unallocated transactions.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/221-4
00:38:14.418 --> 00:38:16.552
<v Marwan Altaie>It's in a table in the e-mail underneath.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/261-0
00:38:25.356 --> 00:38:28.905
<v Marwan Altaie>Investigate further.
Add notes specifically against that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/261-1
00:38:28.905 --> 00:38:31.832
<v Marwan Altaie>transaction line that they're responsible
for,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/261-2
00:38:31.832 --> 00:38:35.195
<v Marwan Altaie>and then we've got an A column that's an
action item,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/261-3
00:38:35.195 --> 00:38:39.928
<v Marwan Altaie>so it could be that a refund has to go
back allocations here still awaiting</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/261-4
00:38:39.928 --> 00:38:40.676
<v Marwan Altaie>information.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/296-0
00:38:41.196 --> 00:38:44.569
<v Marwan Altaie>So so these are both working out
centralised spreadsheet then even though</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/296-1
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:48.217
<v Marwan Altaie>you put it in the e-mail with the list,
that's not actually what they're using.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/296-2
00:38:48.217 --> 00:38:50.405
<v Marwan Altaie>They're using the underlying spreadsheet,
yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/296-3
00:38:50.405 --> 00:38:52.639
<v Marwan Altaie>And then they're allocating that to
individuals,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/296-4
00:38:52.639 --> 00:38:55.876
<v Marwan Altaie>but different different from the UK. OK,
that's Australia only though.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/328-0
00:38:56.556 --> 00:39:02.141
<v Marwan Altaie>Generating that spreadsheet from three a
from bank statement from from bank</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/328-1
00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:07.286
<v Marwan Altaie>statement from the bank statement.
So there won't be a lens equation,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/328-2
00:39:07.286 --> 00:39:11.402
<v Marwan Altaie>so there's no.
So the only information that is in three</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/328-3
00:39:11.402 --> 00:39:14.636
<v Marwan Altaie>A is the receipts once they've been
posted.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/331-0
00:39:15.516 --> 00:39:17.956
<v Marwan Altaie>This is like we don't have.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/379-0
00:39:20.196 --> 00:39:25.289
<v Marwan Altaie>Anything that we can post the unallocated
items two and three a because then they</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/379-1
00:39:25.289 --> 00:39:29.264
<v Marwan Altaie>can't be allocated yet.
So the only place they might show up in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/379-2
00:39:29.264 --> 00:39:33.550
<v Marwan Altaie>3A or sorry they will show up in 3 E is
on our bank reconciliations,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/379-3
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.476
<v Marwan Altaie>but that pops up end of day or.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/423-0
00:39:36.036 --> 00:39:39.285
<v Marwan Altaie>In Australia,
that would be the the following day. OK,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/423-1
00:39:39.285 --> 00:39:42.830
<v Marwan Altaie>so bank statements,
how do they come in export directly out</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/423-2
00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:46.256
<v Marwan Altaie>of the bank. OK.
So the team log into the bank every day,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/423-3
00:39:46.256 --> 00:39:50.805
<v Marwan Altaie>download the bank statements from there
and you work off that because CSV or</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/423-4
00:39:50.805 --> 00:39:53.641
<v Marwan Altaie>something like that,
is it that you get for us,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/411-0
00:39:52.676 --> 00:39:52.796
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>None.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/423-5
00:39:53.641 --> 00:39:55.236
<v Marwan Altaie>that's our source of truth.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/426-0
00:39:56.036 --> 00:39:57.796
<v Marwan Altaie>And then we have to have 3 E to match.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/427-0
00:40:00.476 --> 00:40:00.556
<v Marwan Altaie>Oh.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/461-0
00:40:03.276 --> 00:40:07.442
<v Marwan Altaie>Oh, sorry. OK,
I'm thinking rather than manually making</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/461-1
00:40:07.442 --> 00:40:11.609
<v Marwan Altaie>these requests,
we could potentially use that feed from</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/461-2
00:40:11.609 --> 00:40:16.222
<v Marwan Altaie>the bank. But again,
I think that's phase two or three. Four,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/461-3
00:40:16.222 --> 00:40:19.421
<v Marwan Altaie>no,
we is there not just a way that we can</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/461-4
00:40:19.421 --> 00:40:21.356
<v Marwan Altaie>still use the spreadsheet.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/504-0
00:40:23.836 --> 00:40:27.841
<v Marwan Altaie>Oh yeah, could we load our blanket?
Could we load a spreadsheet into service</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/504-1
00:40:27.841 --> 00:40:30.181
<v Marwan Altaie>now?
That would create all the tasks for us,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/504-2
00:40:30.181 --> 00:40:33.510
<v Marwan Altaie>so digitization similar to what we're
doing for the whip. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/504-3
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:36.631
<v Marwan Altaie>we can look into it.
And my question is with bank statement</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/504-4
00:40:36.631 --> 00:40:39.076
<v Marwan Altaie>stuff,
I have no idea how easy it is gonna be.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/538-0
00:40:40.276 --> 00:40:44.230
<v Marwan Altaie>But with bank statement stuff,
is that not something you wanna keep?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/538-1
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:48.071
<v Marwan Altaie>As in you wanna feed that data into
ServiceNow? Yeah. So if we OK,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/538-2
00:40:48.071 --> 00:40:52.140
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean it would just be it's just a
spreadsheet at the end of the day,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/538-3
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:56.783
<v Marwan Altaie>it doesn't have a lot of client sensitive
information outside of names on a bank</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/538-4
00:40:56.783 --> 00:40:57.356
<v Marwan Altaie>statement.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/539-0
00:40:58.116 --> 00:40:58.516
<v Marwan Altaie>And.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/578-0
00:41:00.076 --> 00:41:05.350
<v Marwan Altaie>And all we would do is just create a
separate spreadsheet or like another tab</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/578-1
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:10.828
<v Marwan Altaie>or something and it would just have the
five items that we can't allocate and we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/578-2
00:41:10.828 --> 00:41:15.156
<v Marwan Altaie>could just then load that in because it's
going to have a date.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/617-0
00:41:15.916 --> 00:41:20.834
<v Marwan Altaie>Credit amount description you get part of
the payments coming into the office again?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/617-1
00:41:20.834 --> 00:41:23.553
<v Marwan Altaie>Nope, nothing at all? No,
because it I'd only.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/617-2
00:41:23.553 --> 00:41:27.140
<v Marwan Altaie>I'd only be doing credit.
We'd only be doing credits. So any,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/617-3
00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:30.612
<v Marwan Altaie>any debit code account number? No, no.
Is there sort codes,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/617-4
00:41:30.612 --> 00:41:34.836
<v Marwan Altaie>account numbers or anything like that? No,
no. Because I mean sometimes.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/651-0
00:41:34.916 --> 00:41:39.603
<v Marwan Altaie>There are, but from bounce back payments,
so it's a closed account number anyway,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/651-1
00:41:39.603 --> 00:41:43.776
<v Marwan Altaie>but we can always like a lot of those
bounce back payments are generally</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/651-2
00:41:43.776 --> 00:41:48.463
<v Marwan Altaie>accounts payable related because it could
be the staff member hasn't told us that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/651-3
00:41:48.463 --> 00:41:51.836
<v Marwan Altaie>they've updated their bank details for
reimbursement or a.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/688-0
00:41:52.716 --> 00:41:56.497
<v Marwan Altaie>AP Supplier has been input incorrectly or
something,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/688-1
00:41:56.497 --> 00:42:01.992
<v Marwan Altaie>so we can always keep them separate and
when it comes into credit control in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/667-0
00:42:00.676 --> 00:42:00.836
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/688-2
00:42:01.992 --> 00:42:07.558
<v Marwan Altaie>terms of allocating to each credit
controller, is that always just on client?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/688-3
00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:12.196
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that the decision that allocates that
work out to the credit?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/690-0
00:42:12.236 --> 00:42:18.476
<v Marwan Altaie>The controllers. Yeah. OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/697-0
00:42:20.756 --> 00:42:24.076
<v Marwan Altaie>When you say, like some food.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/699-0
00:42:27.316 --> 00:42:28.276
<v Marwan Altaie>Or someone can be.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/774-0
00:42:30.076 --> 00:42:32.252
<v Marwan Altaie>So it could be a client,
it could be a ratter,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/774-1
00:42:32.252 --> 00:42:35.909
<v Marwan Altaie>it could be just a random reference
number. It could go to anyone of the team.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/774-2
00:42:35.909 --> 00:42:39.196
<v Marwan Altaie>It will depend on what it is.
It might go to someone if it's a certain</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/774-3
00:42:39.196 --> 00:42:42.344
<v Marwan Altaie>partner for example go to someone.
But if it's just like a generic,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/774-4
00:42:42.344 --> 00:42:44.798
<v Marwan Altaie>don't know,
then it'll be whoever is responsible for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/774-5
00:42:44.798 --> 00:42:47.390
<v Marwan Altaie>the the rota.
On that day we'll have to do all the hard</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/774-6
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:49.196
<v Marwan Altaie>work. Basically do have a rota as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/814-0
00:42:49.316 --> 00:42:52.441
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, right. Yeah.
Because we did talk about rotors and how</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/814-1
00:42:52.441 --> 00:42:55.618
<v Marwan Altaie>we can use them in the back end.
Last week, didn't we? Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/814-2
00:42:55.618 --> 00:42:58.222
<v Marwan Altaie>for allocating. Yeah, definitely. I think,
Chris,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/814-3
00:42:58.222 --> 00:43:02.129
<v Marwan Altaie>do you do your at the moment you all
brought up assistance in allocators a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/814-4
00:43:02.129 --> 00:43:04.837
<v Marwan Altaie>month monthly basis?
Don't only does it just. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/814-5
00:43:04.837 --> 00:43:07.285
<v Marwan Altaie>there is one. I don't know what,
how it works,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/814-6
00:43:07.285 --> 00:43:08.796
<v Marwan Altaie>but it's the each one of the.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/863-0
00:43:08.876 --> 00:43:11.173
<v Marwan Altaie>Team,
I think takes a week and they just pass</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/863-1
00:43:11.173 --> 00:43:15.219
<v Marwan Altaie>it around. Oh yeah, I'm not 100% sure.
Anyway, it works. The router. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/863-2
00:43:15.219 --> 00:43:19.214
<v Marwan Altaie>So we'd need to understand the router.
We'd need to understand the structure of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/863-3
00:43:19.214 --> 00:43:23.310
<v Marwan Altaie>the bank report you're currently getting.
At the moment we also get to understand</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/863-4
00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:26.506
<v Marwan Altaie>how often it gets refreshed.
If there's any changes being made,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/863-5
00:43:26.506 --> 00:43:27.156
<v Marwan Altaie>what happens?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/908-0
00:43:27.276 --> 00:43:31.897
<v Marwan Altaie>What should be kind of the if there's a
logic or validation in the system,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/908-1
00:43:31.897 --> 00:43:36.888
<v Marwan Altaie>that kind of stuff would be good to know.
Yep, in terms of the e-mail situation,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/908-2
00:43:36.888 --> 00:43:41.940
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't see an easy way to just circulate
that to everyone and they just pick off</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/908-3
00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:45.390
<v Marwan Altaie>what they need.
We can potentially create subtasks on a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/908-4
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.116
<v Marwan Altaie>ticket and assign people to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/957-0
00:43:47.236 --> 00:43:50.490
<v Marwan Altaie>Specific subtasks,
but even then there needs to be a way of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/957-1
00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:54.396
<v Marwan Altaie>someone taking that ownership,
so it needs to manually we we can create</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/957-2
00:43:54.396 --> 00:43:56.782
<v Marwan Altaie>assignment groups in the system,
but again,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/957-3
00:43:56.782 --> 00:43:59.711
<v Marwan Altaie>someone needs to actually go in and say
this is mine.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/957-4
00:43:59.711 --> 00:44:03.562
<v Marwan Altaie>This is mine and I think it's not as easy
as the outlook is currently.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/957-5
00:44:03.562 --> 00:44:04.756
<v Marwan Altaie>It's more centralised.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1003-0
00:44:05.076 --> 00:44:08.134
<v Marwan Altaie>You have more control,
but will they actually use it in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1003-1
00:44:08.134 --> 00:44:11.574
<v Marwan Altaie>comparison to an e-mail?
Just pinging out to the 50 people and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1003-2
00:44:11.574 --> 00:44:14.905
<v Marwan Altaie>then they come back saying yeah,
this is mine, this is mine.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1003-3
00:44:14.905 --> 00:44:19.328
<v Marwan Altaie>That's that's the big yeah at the moment.
Are you saying that the easier way for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1003-4
00:44:19.328 --> 00:44:23.915
<v Marwan Altaie>credit control to be able to delegate out
the tasks is dependent on how cash is and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1003-5
00:44:23.915 --> 00:44:24.516
<v Marwan Altaie>input that?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1043-0
00:44:24.716 --> 00:44:29.424
<v Marwan Altaie>Information for them, I mean,
and what we don't obviously want to be</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1043-1
00:44:29.424 --> 00:44:32.836
<v Marwan Altaie>building in your process is duplication
of, yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1043-2
00:44:32.836 --> 00:44:37.749
<v Marwan Altaie>annual input so that we can then split it
at the other end. On average,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1043-3
00:44:37.749 --> 00:44:41.297
<v Marwan Altaie>we'd probably have 10 or less for
Australia anyway,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1043-4
00:44:41.297 --> 00:44:44.436
<v Marwan Altaie>10 or less unallocated transactions in a
day.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1069-0
00:44:44.956 --> 00:44:51.914
<v Marwan Altaie>So if we can make the form as like quick
and easy to complete as possible for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1069-1
00:44:51.914 --> 00:44:58.337
<v Marwan Altaie>cashiers for credit control to then be
able to use their dashboards and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1069-2
00:44:58.337 --> 00:44:59.676
<v Marwan Altaie>allocations to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1117-0
00:45:00.516 --> 00:45:05.153
<v Marwan Altaie>The best that they want to be able to use
them then we're probably better off</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1117-1
00:45:05.153 --> 00:45:09.849
<v Marwan Altaie>looking at what that front end looks like,
what the submission of the data is,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1117-2
00:45:09.849 --> 00:45:14.189
<v Marwan Altaie>because not all of the unallocated items
are for credit control as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1117-3
00:45:14.189 --> 00:45:18.588
<v Marwan Altaie>So that information wouldn't be going
into ServiceNow for credit control.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1117-4
00:45:18.588 --> 00:45:19.956
<v Marwan Altaie>We would take that off.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1168-0
00:45:20.036 --> 00:45:23.687
<v Marwan Altaie>One because it's either for accounts
payable or it's for payroll.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1168-1
00:45:23.687 --> 00:45:26.896
<v Marwan Altaie>And obviously payroll,
we wouldn't be putting in there in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1168-2
00:45:26.896 --> 00:45:30.271
<v Marwan Altaie>ServiceNow anyway,
if we are looking at that banking file as</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1168-3
00:45:30.271 --> 00:45:32.815
<v Marwan Altaie>it,
we would only want to take in the minimum</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1168-4
00:45:32.815 --> 00:45:35.471
<v Marwan Altaie>amount of details.
It's actually useful to you.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1168-5
00:45:35.471 --> 00:45:39.676
<v Marwan Altaie>So stuff like bank account details,
if you don't need it, we should not be.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1179-0
00:45:40.196 --> 00:45:45.402
<v Marwan Altaie>It's not, it's not in there.
So all we get all of our exports from the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1179-1
00:45:45.402 --> 00:45:47.236
<v Marwan Altaie>bank is transaction date.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1227-0
00:45:48.596 --> 00:45:52.374
<v Marwan Altaie>Credit credit amount like credit value
narrowed it like the description.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1227-1
00:45:52.374 --> 00:45:54.859
<v Marwan Altaie>That's all that comes up on the bank
statement.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1227-2
00:45:54.859 --> 00:45:58.534
<v Marwan Altaie>And then there might be another reference
that pops up, but that's it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1227-3
00:45:58.534 --> 00:46:02.106
<v Marwan Altaie>Like that is the bad that's.
And is that enough to make decisions on</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1227-4
00:46:02.106 --> 00:46:04.643
<v Marwan Altaie>in terms of routing or even if there is a
route,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1227-5
00:46:04.643 --> 00:46:07.956
<v Marwan Altaie>is it just a because if it's just a rugby
path straight across?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1238-0
00:46:08.156 --> 00:46:11.236
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, I mean question there.
So that is hospital cost, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1286-0
00:46:13.436 --> 00:46:17.313
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We would also need to be able to put down
details of what office the money can run</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1286-1
00:46:17.313 --> 00:46:20.629
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>to in the UK because obviously we do look
after the different offices,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1286-2
00:46:20.629 --> 00:46:24.319
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>so we need to be able to see if it was
auk receipt or a Luxembourg receipt and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1286-3
00:46:24.319 --> 00:46:27.636
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>what currency it was as well because we
deal with multiple currencies.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1320-0
00:46:28.316 --> 00:46:33.605
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, we've got currency accounts too,
but also what I expect of my team is to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1320-1
00:46:33.605 --> 00:46:39.028
<v Marwan Altaie>provide any additional information where
there might be a remittance that has an</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1320-2
00:46:39.028 --> 00:46:43.916
<v Marwan Altaie>invoice on it that's been already been
paid or reversed like any reason.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1364-0
00:46:44.196 --> 00:46:46.837
<v Marwan Altaie>That cashiers have that they cannot
allocate.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1364-1
00:46:46.837 --> 00:46:51.430
<v Marwan Altaie>I expect them to pass that information on
to credit control as well to help the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1364-2
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:54.416
<v Marwan Altaie>investigation.
So additional fields to include that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1364-3
00:46:54.416 --> 00:46:57.574
<v Marwan Altaie>would be helpful.
Is it worth just taking a step back?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1364-4
00:46:57.574 --> 00:47:02.167
<v Marwan Altaie>And I'm aware there's a lot of kind of
nuance and a lot of trigger points and a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1364-5
00:47:02.167 --> 00:47:03.316
<v Marwan Altaie>lot of touch points.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1427-0
00:47:04.636 --> 00:47:07.928
<v Marwan Altaie>For these, in particular, phase one,
if if we're assuming phase two,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1427-1
00:47:07.928 --> 00:47:11.124
<v Marwan Altaie>there might be integrations,
it might be worth for now simplifying</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1427-2
00:47:11.124 --> 00:47:13.223
<v Marwan Altaie>what we're trying to resolve in the
system.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1427-3
00:47:13.223 --> 00:47:17.088
<v Marwan Altaie>So we're not trying to resolve everyone.
We're trying to focus on cashiering and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1427-4
00:47:17.088 --> 00:47:21.000
<v Marwan Altaie>credit control or maybe simplifying it to
the decision points and the outcome and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1427-5
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.956
<v Marwan Altaie>everything that comes before stays as is.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1482-0
00:47:23.316 --> 00:47:27.169
<v Marwan Altaie>And then we focus a bit more on it once
we have some data and integrations</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1482-1
00:47:27.169 --> 00:47:30.150
<v Marwan Altaie>because as it stands,
I think it'll be quite difficult to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1482-2
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:34.106
<v Marwan Altaie>include all of these nuances and all of
this data and all of these reporting</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1482-3
00:47:34.106 --> 00:47:37.857
<v Marwan Altaie>without a system feeding this information,
just food to thought. Marwan,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1482-4
00:47:37.857 --> 00:47:41.762
<v Marwan Altaie>am I I just don't know that we'll get an
integration on this particular one</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1482-5
00:47:41.762 --> 00:47:42.996
<v Marwan Altaie>because the information.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1520-0
00:47:43.076 --> 00:47:46.306
<v Marwan Altaie>Information comes from the bank account.
Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1520-1
00:47:46.306 --> 00:47:51.462
<v Marwan Altaie>And like the actual external bank
accounts for the balances on their banks</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1520-2
00:47:51.462 --> 00:47:54.624
<v Marwan Altaie>and stuff.
So integration isn't going to be a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1520-3
00:47:54.624 --> 00:47:58.405
<v Marwan Altaie>solution here.
I think what we're aiming to do here is</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1520-4
00:47:58.405 --> 00:48:01.636
<v Marwan Altaie>remove the e-mail traffic and find a easy
way.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1565-0
00:48:02.076 --> 00:48:07.609
<v Marwan Altaie>To pass the list of unallocated funds
that we have to credit control but allow</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1565-1
00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:13.141
<v Marwan Altaie>them to do that in a way that that might
not all get dealt with by one person.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1565-2
00:48:13.141 --> 00:48:18.814
<v Marwan Altaie>So how we can split that up and if that
means that so see when you get your bank</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1565-3
00:48:18.814 --> 00:48:21.476
<v Marwan Altaie>statements in from your bank accounts?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1586-0
00:48:22.556 --> 00:48:26.669
<v Marwan Altaie>You're then taking that information and
and putting it into the spreadsheet.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1586-1
00:48:26.669 --> 00:48:29.501
<v Marwan Altaie>Or is it doing it?
Is it is that part of the report?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1586-2
00:48:29.501 --> 00:48:30.356
<v Marwan Altaie>The spreadsheet?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1603-0
00:48:30.796 --> 00:48:33.678
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>That's how we do it in the UK.
We just take what information we need</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1603-1
00:48:33.678 --> 00:48:37.061
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>from the bank statement and then put it
into a spreadsheet and share with credit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1603-2
00:48:37.061 --> 00:48:37.396
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>control.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1646-0
00:48:38.236 --> 00:48:41.924
<v Marwan Altaie>So is it not a case then that if you're
still doing that manual step,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1646-1
00:48:41.924 --> 00:48:45.876
<v Marwan Altaie>that manual step just goes into the form
and ServiceNow rather than on the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1646-2
00:48:45.876 --> 00:48:49.353
<v Marwan Altaie>spreadsheet? So actually,
as an individual one that comes through</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1646-3
00:48:49.353 --> 00:48:53.516
<v Marwan Altaie>and then that gives you the flexibility
as they come through to allocate them.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1682-0
00:48:54.716 --> 00:48:59.392
<v Marwan Altaie>I think we can potentially auto allocate
some of them if we have rules around what</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1682-1
00:48:59.392 --> 00:49:01.984
<v Marwan Altaie>that is over the assumption we're
digitising.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1682-2
00:49:01.984 --> 00:49:06.209
<v Marwan Altaie>The reports are into service now,
so we're not even using the spreadsheet.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1682-3
00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:10.434
<v Marwan Altaie>Actually what Martin's just saying there
is he takes the money from a bank</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1682-4
00:49:10.434 --> 00:49:11.956
<v Marwan Altaie>statement, the information.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1714-0
00:49:12.356 --> 00:49:17.243
<v Marwan Altaie>And tapes and a spreadsheet.
So instead of typing a spreadsheet type</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1714-1
00:49:17.243 --> 00:49:20.431
<v Marwan Altaie>into ServiceNow, yeah,
I think we discussed.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1714-2
00:49:20.431 --> 00:49:25.815
<v Marwan Altaie>We started touching on that for the
suspense account in Australia last week</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1703-0
00:49:21.756 --> 00:49:21.876
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1714-3
00:49:25.815 --> 00:49:28.436
<v Marwan Altaie>where I think our our ideal like the.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1763-0
00:49:29.356 --> 00:49:33.977
<v Marwan Altaie>Best way forward would to be would be to
house all of the information for the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1763-1
00:49:33.977 --> 00:49:38.481
<v Marwan Altaie>suspense account in service now so that
we didn't have this annoying clunky</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1763-2
00:49:38.481 --> 00:49:43.340
<v Marwan Altaie>spreadsheet that we currently run off so
we can do the same for unallocated where</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1763-3
00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.236
<v Marwan Altaie>we can track everything that is.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1789-0
00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:49.673
<v Marwan Altaie>Noted all part of our unallocated bucket
through ServiceNow,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1789-1
00:49:49.673 --> 00:49:54.396
<v Marwan Altaie>that'd be ideal because then we're not
having to keep moving in between two, OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1826-0
00:49:54.316 --> 00:49:57.254
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.
And I know this doesn't touch and credit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1826-1
00:49:57.254 --> 00:50:02.381
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>controls process. I would say in the UK,
99% of the money we receive into account</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1826-2
00:50:02.381 --> 00:50:06.195
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>is for credit control.
But we do have money that arrives for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1826-3
00:50:06.195 --> 00:50:09.196
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>lots of different departments as well
could be.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1822-0
00:50:08.516 --> 00:50:08.716
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1862-0
00:50:09.556 --> 00:50:13.719
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Ask people or the accounting reporting
team of payroll so we almost need a way</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1862-1
00:50:13.719 --> 00:50:16.775
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>to pick which team we want to send these
requests off to,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1862-2
00:50:16.775 --> 00:50:20.253
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>or which individual person we want to
send these requests off to,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1862-3
00:50:20.253 --> 00:50:22.836
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>rather than it just all going to credit
control.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1909-0
00:50:23.836 --> 00:50:26.358
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah,
we can set up teams to and I think that's</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1909-1
00:50:26.358 --> 00:50:29.722
<v Marwan Altaie>something. Yeah. Yeah,
that you can control on your build side,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1909-2
00:50:29.722 --> 00:50:33.453
<v Marwan Altaie>Martin, if that makes sense.
So we don't just auto allocate everything</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1909-3
00:50:33.453 --> 00:50:36.134
<v Marwan Altaie>that comes in on that process that kicks
that off.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1909-4
00:50:36.134 --> 00:50:40.233
<v Marwan Altaie>You have the autonomy to be able to see
actually these 15 are going to credit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1892-0
00:50:36.676 --> 00:50:36.916
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1909-5
00:50:40.233 --> 00:50:42.756
<v Marwan Altaie>control list fives going to people or
whatever.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1943-0
00:50:43.916 --> 00:50:47.117
<v Marwan Altaie>But we just understand what the workflow
is for that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1943-1
00:50:47.117 --> 00:50:50.437
<v Marwan Altaie>When we're transferring that over to each
of the teams.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1943-2
00:50:50.437 --> 00:50:55.061
<v Marwan Altaie>Presumably if we will have assignment
groups that are linked. So for example,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1943-3
00:50:55.061 --> 00:50:59.449
<v Marwan Altaie>UK cashiers will link up with UK credit
control team, Australia cashiers,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1943-4
00:50:59.449 --> 00:51:00.516
<v Marwan Altaie>Australia cashier.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1985-0
00:51:01.036 --> 00:51:05.169
<v Marwan Altaie>So if I'm in the UK,
I'm in UK cashiers and Mart and I'm</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1985-1
00:51:05.169 --> 00:51:10.246
<v Marwan Altaie>sending a an individual request per line
item over to Stephen's team.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1985-2
00:51:10.246 --> 00:51:13.654
<v Marwan Altaie>Do I just say it's the whole assignment
group,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/1985-3
00:51:13.654 --> 00:51:17.716
<v Marwan Altaie>then someone picks it up and then I go
and do it or do?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2030-0
00:51:18.036 --> 00:51:21.461
<v Marwan Altaie>Do you just go into something?
Doesn't go into like one person's little</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2030-1
00:51:21.461 --> 00:51:24.885
<v Marwan Altaie>tablet thing. Whatever it is, box.
And then yeah, they are signing out.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2030-2
00:51:24.885 --> 00:51:27.406
<v Marwan Altaie>So that depends how we set up the
assignment groups.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2030-3
00:51:27.406 --> 00:51:30.451
<v Marwan Altaie>Am I right in saying we can set
assignment groups upon process.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2030-4
00:51:30.451 --> 00:51:34.351
<v Marwan Altaie>So you can set up assignment groups where
you have multiple owners if you want to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2030-5
00:51:34.351 --> 00:51:37.396
<v Marwan Altaie>call them that. And they can go.
And so you can have 10 people.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2082-0
00:51:37.756 --> 00:51:41.528
<v Marwan Altaie>That are managing ServiceNow tickets so
they can go in and each of them can pick</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2082-1
00:51:41.528 --> 00:51:43.903
<v Marwan Altaie>up their own tickets.
That's that's functionality.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2082-2
00:51:43.903 --> 00:51:46.045
<v Marwan Altaie>The reason we have a schedule,
this UK do it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2082-3
00:51:46.045 --> 00:51:49.165
<v Marwan Altaie>Australia had to do it as well.
We had to have rotors because what</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2082-4
00:51:49.165 --> 00:51:52.844
<v Marwan Altaie>happened is cashier's to send around the
emails and they want to twiddle their</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2082-5
00:51:52.844 --> 00:51:56.150
<v Marwan Altaie>thumbs and they want to take any
ownership because they want to do the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2082-6
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.756
<v Marwan Altaie>hard work so.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2129-0
00:51:57.076 --> 00:52:00.824
<v Marwan Altaie>Saying if we could send to an assignment
group, yeah, and then you pick it up,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2129-1
00:52:00.824 --> 00:52:03.766
<v Marwan Altaie>then you're responsible for it.
That's on you. It's with you.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2129-2
00:52:03.766 --> 00:52:07.088
<v Marwan Altaie>You could see it's with you.
It's got your. It's on your little list.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2129-3
00:52:07.088 --> 00:52:10.030
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. And ultimately,
what we want to do is get to a level of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2129-4
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:13.778
<v Marwan Altaie>auto assign in. So when it comes in,
the system recognises where that needs to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2129-5
00:52:13.778 --> 00:52:16.436
<v Marwan Altaie>go. So if that's a group or an individual,
that can be.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2155-0
00:52:17.196 --> 00:52:21.604
<v Marwan Altaie>This. Yeah, could be.
Hopefully it's not too complicated,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2155-1
00:52:21.604 --> 00:52:24.796
<v Marwan Altaie>but again,
so actually from an Australian</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2155-2
00:52:24.796 --> 00:52:30.572
<v Marwan Altaie>perspective, when we've got a task well,
an unallocated item that becomes a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2155-3
00:52:30.572 --> 00:52:31.636
<v Marwan Altaie>suspense item.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2192-0
00:52:32.636 --> 00:52:36.164
<v Marwan Altaie>So if you're moving money from
unallocated to suspense,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2192-1
00:52:36.164 --> 00:52:41.205
<v Marwan Altaie>it means that we can partially allocate
the funds to to invoices or an invoice,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2192-2
00:52:41.205 --> 00:52:46.309
<v Marwan Altaie>and then the remaining balance of that
amount that we received has to go then to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2192-3
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.876
<v Marwan Altaie>suspense.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2193-0
00:52:47.396 --> 00:52:47.836
<v Marwan Altaie>And umm.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2229-0
00:52:49.356 --> 00:52:56.037
<v Marwan Altaie>That would it be possible to then have
that workflow move from an unallocated</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2229-1
00:52:56.037 --> 00:53:02.034
<v Marwan Altaie>state to adjust the amount and move it
across to that suspense state.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2229-2
00:53:02.034 --> 00:53:08.716
<v Marwan Altaie>So just to carry out ServiceNow is not a
bank functionality, it's we can but.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2283-0
00:53:10.996 --> 00:53:15.295
<v Marwan Altaie>You'd have to 1st digitise some form of
source of truth or a table or something,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2283-1
00:53:15.295 --> 00:53:18.054
<v Marwan Altaie>but we could then empower it.
Feel free to jump in.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2283-2
00:53:18.054 --> 00:53:21.716
<v Marwan Altaie>We can then use decisions,
or we can use certain fields so it can be</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2283-3
00:53:21.716 --> 00:53:25.272
<v Marwan Altaie>as simple as a drop down.
You click status change from allocate to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2283-4
00:53:25.272 --> 00:53:28.669
<v Marwan Altaie>part, allocate, update this field.
What's the change been made?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2283-5
00:53:28.669 --> 00:53:29.996
<v Marwan Altaie>What's the reason? So we?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2333-0
00:53:30.076 --> 00:53:32.432
<v Marwan Altaie>Have all the functionality and the agent
workspace,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2333-1
00:53:32.432 --> 00:53:35.015
<v Marwan Altaie>but if you want Agent Workspaces just
like the back end.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2333-2
00:53:35.015 --> 00:53:38.732
<v Marwan Altaie>But if you want it to the extent of it's
showing you the numbers it's showing you</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2333-3
00:53:38.732 --> 00:53:41.315
<v Marwan Altaie>what's changed.
It's showing you minus from this amount.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2333-4
00:53:41.315 --> 00:53:44.215
<v Marwan Altaie>On this line we would need to have some
form of centralization,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2319-0
00:53:41.876 --> 00:53:42.036
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2333-5
00:53:44.215 --> 00:53:47.116
<v Marwan Altaie>so you're basically creating a mini
report or a mini dashboard.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2368-0
00:53:47.396 --> 00:53:51.810
<v Marwan Altaie>And it could be the digitization of your
bank statements or unallocated accounts,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2368-1
00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:56.171
<v Marwan Altaie>but something needs to sit in the system
to make this solution effective if that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2368-2
00:53:56.171 --> 00:53:59.347
<v Marwan Altaie>makes sense. Yeah,
I guess it sounds like there's 22 parts</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2368-3
00:53:59.347 --> 00:54:03.116
<v Marwan Altaie>to it because even if we just had the,
as you said, mom and the task.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2415-0
00:54:03.556 --> 00:54:08.400
<v Marwan Altaie>It moves 'cause I think essentially
that's what I'm what what we're looking</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2415-1
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:13.054
<v Marwan Altaie>at is what we're being able to move the
task along the workflows because</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2415-2
00:54:13.054 --> 00:54:18.217
<v Marwan Altaie>essentially the money starts as a receipt
and then it becomes an unallocated and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2415-3
00:54:18.217 --> 00:54:21.596
<v Marwan Altaie>then it becomes a suspense item and then
it becomes.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2475-0
00:54:22.116 --> 00:54:25.944
<v Marwan Altaie>Client refund, whatever.
So that task if we can have a way to move</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2475-1
00:54:25.944 --> 00:54:29.944
<v Marwan Altaie>that task rather than the money,
the task as a workflow through those</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2475-2
00:54:29.944 --> 00:54:34.344
<v Marwan Altaie>items so that we can still have it
sitting with a responsible owner and move</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2440-0
00:54:31.036 --> 00:54:31.236
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2475-3
00:54:34.344 --> 00:54:37.887
<v Marwan Altaie>it along that way,
which is what I think would happen, right?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2475-4
00:54:37.887 --> 00:54:41.716
<v Marwan Altaie>So it comes in to you as a receipt you go
oh, this is unallocated.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2529-0
00:54:41.876 --> 00:54:45.122
<v Marwan Altaie>Credit control. Credit control go.
We still can't allocate this,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2529-1
00:54:45.122 --> 00:54:48.968
<v Marwan Altaie>so I'm assuming you send that back and
that's when it then goes to suspense.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2529-2
00:54:48.968 --> 00:54:51.666
<v Marwan Altaie>That's an action you take from a cashier
perspective.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2529-3
00:54:51.666 --> 00:54:55.662
<v Marwan Altaie>So you're just moving that to action.
Yeah, I think just wanting to understand.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2505-0
00:54:55.236 --> 00:54:55.476
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2529-4
00:54:55.662 --> 00:54:59.558
<v Marwan Altaie>So I'm I'm going to jump ahead to the
proposed solution because I think it is</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2529-5
00:54:59.558 --> 00:55:01.356
<v Marwan Altaie>in line with that and we can use it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2530-0
00:55:01.516 --> 00:55:01.956
<v Marwan Altaie>Quote Cliff.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2564-0
00:55:01.516 --> 00:55:05.319
<v Parik Narain>Marvin, just a just a point there, right?
I mean there are two I wanted to pick up</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2564-1
00:55:05.319 --> 00:55:09.077
<v Parik Narain>on the previous point around the data we
hold in service some and also we hope we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2564-2
00:55:09.077 --> 00:55:11.598
<v Parik Narain>manage that data.
So this particular coming on to this</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2564-3
00:55:11.598 --> 00:55:14.531
<v Parik Narain>particular task allocation and task
moving forward with states,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2564-4
00:55:14.531 --> 00:55:15.356
<v Parik Narain>I think that's OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2614-0
00:55:16.036 --> 00:55:19.811
<v Parik Narain>But as you said rightly,
Marvin ServiceNow is not a financial data</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2614-1
00:55:19.811 --> 00:55:23.305
<v Parik Narain>management platform, right?
We can we take it as a task based</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2614-2
00:55:23.305 --> 00:55:26.123
<v Parik Narain>approach,
but as soon as it comes to holding data</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2614-3
00:55:26.123 --> 00:55:29.504
<v Parik Narain>or changing values,
we have to look at at at a deeper level</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2614-4
00:55:29.504 --> 00:55:32.040
<v Parik Narain>just to make sure we are meeting
compliance,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2614-5
00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:35.196
<v Parik Narain>compliance and security guidelines and
also understand.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2660-0
00:55:35.276 --> 00:55:38.879
<v Parik Narain>And if you want to change numbers who has
that authority to change?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2660-1
00:55:38.879 --> 00:55:43.118
<v Parik Narain>Change the numbers and where does it go?
Because service can't be the source of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2660-2
00:55:43.118 --> 00:55:46.775
<v Parik Narain>truth for any of the numbers.
If you if you ask me because it should</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2635-0
00:55:43.156 --> 00:55:43.556
<v Marwan Altaie>So what?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2642-0
00:55:45.556 --> 00:55:45.836
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2660-3
00:55:46.775 --> 00:55:49.583
<v Parik Narain>all be coming from your financial finance
platforms,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2651-0
00:55:48.436 --> 00:55:49.276
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's her character.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2660-4
00:55:49.583 --> 00:55:51.756
<v Parik Narain>3 slash etcetera or your billing systems.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2656-0
00:55:50.756 --> 00:55:51.116
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2685-0
00:55:52.356 --> 00:55:54.777
<v Parik Narain>That's the that's the point I want to
make,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2685-1
00:55:54.777 --> 00:55:57.638
<v Parik Narain>but let's not make ServiceNow data change
platform,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2669-0
00:55:54.876 --> 00:55:54.996
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2685-2
00:55:57.638 --> 00:56:02.316
<v Parik Narain>but we can drive the controls around that
through the platform, if that makes sense.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2719-0
00:56:00.476 --> 00:56:04.445
<v Marwan Altaie>So just just something that, Eric,
it's it's not we're not driving the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2719-1
00:56:04.445 --> 00:56:09.142
<v Marwan Altaie>change in service now as I understand it,
it's just if there's a way we could house</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2719-2
00:56:09.142 --> 00:56:12.943
<v Marwan Altaie>some of the other system data or the
current spreadsheets minus any</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2719-3
00:56:12.943 --> 00:56:15.236
<v Marwan Altaie>confidential information. So it would be.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2743-0
00:56:15.756 --> 00:56:19.358
<v Parik Narain>But that's yeah, absolutely fine.
We can we can review that in line with</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2792-0
00:56:15.756 --> 00:56:19.080
<v Marwan Altaie>A basic report with a couple. Yeah,
that's that's the. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2792-1
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:23.168
<v Marwan Altaie>So that that would be the objective.
So they could have a centralised area</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2743-1
00:56:19.358 --> 00:56:21.036
<v Parik Narain>security guidelines as well, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2792-2
00:56:23.168 --> 00:56:25.784
<v Marwan Altaie>instead of going to their current
spreadsheets,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2792-3
00:56:25.784 --> 00:56:30.145
<v Marwan Altaie>they just export from whatever system
they need to and we'll give them a format</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2759-0
00:56:27.236 --> 00:56:27.356
<v Parik Narain>OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2792-4
00:56:30.145 --> 00:56:34.342
<v Marwan Altaie>where they can import it and house again
compliant non sensitive data in the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2783-0
00:56:33.436 --> 00:56:34.036
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2792-5
00:56:34.342 --> 00:56:34.996
<v Marwan Altaie>service now.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2805-0
00:56:35.276 --> 00:56:39.304
<v Marwan Altaie>But to potentially kick off triggers and
to have that visibility if they want to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2843-0
00:56:38.476 --> 00:56:42.527
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, got it. Got it. Just a question,
just a question on that. Is there any,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2805-1
00:56:39.304 --> 00:56:40.796
<v Marwan Altaie>make changes, is that correct?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2843-1
00:56:42.527 --> 00:56:44.813
<v Parik Narain>any obviously Australia has their own
data,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2843-2
00:56:44.813 --> 00:56:47.930
<v Parik Narain>previous rules you can have their own
data, previous rules,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2843-3
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:51.566
<v Parik Narain>are you complying with with your current
solution on the spreadsheet,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2843-4
00:56:51.566 --> 00:56:53.956
<v Parik Narain>do you have to comply or be auditable
around?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2891-0
00:56:54.236 --> 00:56:58.279
<v Parik Narain>Any any of these compliance items so that
we we can take any requirements around</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2891-1
00:56:58.279 --> 00:57:00.825
<v Parik Narain>that as well as we hold this data in the
platform.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2891-2
00:57:00.825 --> 00:57:04.668
<v Parik Narain>We want to be compliant with all the
security security compliance guidelines</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2891-3
00:57:04.668 --> 00:57:07.464
<v Parik Narain>for each country.
Is there anything which comes to mind</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2891-4
00:57:07.464 --> 00:57:11.657
<v Parik Narain>right now which we have to comply with or
otherwise we have we have a standard GDPR</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2891-5
00:57:11.657 --> 00:57:12.156
<v Parik Narain>and other.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2913-0
00:57:12.916 --> 00:57:17.286
<v Parik Narain>Other other regulatory compliance areas,
we service generally complies with,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2913-1
00:57:17.286 --> 00:57:21.940
<v Parik Narain>but if we need to secure the information
for compliance then that becomes becomes</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2913-2
00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:23.756
<v Parik Narain>another layer of control on top.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2932-0
00:57:24.716 --> 00:57:27.216
<v Marwan Altaie>The standard data rules depending on the
country,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2932-1
00:57:27.216 --> 00:57:31.166
<v Marwan Altaie>but you've also got because you've got
your assignment groups only should take</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2926-0
00:57:30.436 --> 00:57:30.756
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2932-2
00:57:31.166 --> 00:57:33.716
<v Marwan Altaie>care of security because you're not going
to have.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2987-0
00:57:35.476 --> 00:57:37.644
<v Parik Narain>Right.
But holding data on ServiceNow is not a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2987-1
00:57:37.644 --> 00:57:40.181
<v Parik Narain>problem, right?
Because obviously your spreadsheet are</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2987-2
00:57:40.181 --> 00:57:42.902
<v Parik Narain>within your own network.
Now service has a cloud solution.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2987-3
00:57:42.902 --> 00:57:46.731
<v Parik Narain>If you see they're outside your network.
So we have to just take take this through</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2987-4
00:57:46.731 --> 00:57:49.913
<v Parik Narain>security as well separately.
But just want to raise a flag that this</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/2987-5
00:57:49.913 --> 00:57:51.436
<v Parik Narain>might be considered that way too.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3027-0
00:57:52.316 --> 00:57:54.718
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean,
would it help if we provided like a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3027-1
00:57:54.718 --> 00:57:58.594
<v Marwan Altaie>version of what our unallocated and
suspense for Australia looks like,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3027-2
00:57:58.594 --> 00:58:01.433
<v Marwan Altaie>and then that might give you guys a
better idea of,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3005-0
00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:00.596
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3027-3
00:58:01.433 --> 00:58:05.419
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean unfortunately that those
spreadsheets are supposed to be a source</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3009-0
00:58:01.996 --> 00:58:02.116
<v Parik Narain>Cool.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3027-4
00:58:05.419 --> 00:58:07.876
<v Marwan Altaie>of truth.
It's not 3A and it's not the best.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3025-0
00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:07.436
<v Parik Narain>I mean.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3076-0
00:58:08.196 --> 00:58:14.174
<v Marwan Altaie>Bank so that might help give you guys an
idea of or visualise what we're currently</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3031-0
00:58:09.876 --> 00:58:10.236
<v Parik Narain>Correct.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3076-1
00:58:14.174 --> 00:58:17.920
<v Marwan Altaie>working on to see if there's any possible
solution,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3076-2
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:23.898
<v Marwan Altaie>because I think my ideal from a cache use
perspective is that the majority of that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3057-0
00:58:21.516 --> 00:58:21.796
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3076-3
00:58:23.898 --> 00:58:27.716
<v Marwan Altaie>data is actually housed in service now
because that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3079-0
00:58:27.836 --> 00:58:29.476
<v Marwan Altaie>Would could then become outsourced.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3124-0
00:58:28.996 --> 00:58:32.097
<v Parik Narain>If we can move you away from, yeah,
that would I think in the morning when</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3088-0
00:58:30.996 --> 00:58:31.716
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, it's.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3124-1
00:58:32.097 --> 00:58:35.157
<v Parik Narain>when someone mentioned spreadsheet.
My my first point was can we move you</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3124-2
00:58:35.157 --> 00:58:38.134
<v Parik Narain>away from those spreadsheets because
they're so spreadsheets, but yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3124-3
00:58:38.134 --> 00:58:41.236
<v Parik Narain>it'll it'll be good to have a look.
It'll be good to have a look at those.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3160-0
00:58:41.276 --> 00:58:44.489
<v Marwan Altaie>We're driving here, right?
We just need to understand what data is</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3160-1
00:58:44.489 --> 00:58:46.742
<v Marwan Altaie>in there.
And can we put in service now that's</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3129-0
00:58:45.796 --> 00:58:45.996
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3160-2
00:58:46.742 --> 00:58:49.572
<v Marwan Altaie>that's the bottom line.
We're just trying to move from the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3160-3
00:58:49.572 --> 00:58:52.017
<v Marwan Altaie>spreadsheet,
put the input and the service now and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3140-0
00:58:50.596 --> 00:58:50.836
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3160-4
00:58:52.017 --> 00:58:55.662
<v Marwan Altaie>then pass stuff between us. Yeah,
it's really just quite as simple as that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3149-0
00:58:52.716 --> 00:58:52.996
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3160-5
00:58:55.662 --> 00:58:57.916
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, absolutely.
That's definitely our ideal.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3185-0
00:58:59.276 --> 00:59:05.176
<v Marwan Altaie>But maybe just you guys being able to see
that actual spreadsheet might help you.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3185-1
00:59:05.176 --> 00:59:10.716
<v Marwan Altaie>Yep, happy to send that. Yes please cool.
Just going to make a note of that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3175-0
00:59:05.516 --> 00:59:06.036
<v Parik Narain>Definitely.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3187-0
00:59:13.236 --> 00:59:14.396
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm also gonna.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3230-0
00:59:16.716 --> 00:59:20.256
<v Marwan Altaie>I feel like a lot of the questions you
have in terms of functionality might be</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3230-1
00:59:20.256 --> 00:59:23.483
<v Marwan Altaie>helped by the proposed solution.
Chris and Tim have seen it, I believe.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3230-2
00:59:23.483 --> 00:59:27.069
<v Marwan Altaie>So hopefully it might help the rest of
the team just visualise it a little bit.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3230-3
00:59:27.069 --> 00:59:29.624
<v Marwan Altaie>This isn't the concrete one,
but just in terms of Chris,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3230-4
00:59:29.624 --> 00:59:31.596
<v Marwan Altaie>you remember the solution, don't you?
Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3234-0
00:59:32.636 --> 00:59:37.676
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. Talk jump across to that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3239-0
00:59:41.236 --> 00:59:43.036
<v Marwan Altaie>Like I've been jumping from slide slide
today.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3263-0
00:59:46.676 --> 00:59:49.806
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry,
I was just looking at the cashiering</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3263-1
00:59:49.806 --> 00:59:55.711
<v Marwan Altaie>processes for the office account receipts
and I think we've got both Australia and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3263-2
00:59:55.711 --> 00:59:57.276
<v Marwan Altaie>UK, so it's all there.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3294-0
01:00:00.076 --> 01:00:04.121
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, so bear with me.
This was meant to be following from a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3294-1
01:00:04.121 --> 01:00:07.207
<v Marwan Altaie>nicely structured presentation,
but it's OK,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3294-2
01:00:07.207 --> 01:00:11.664
<v Marwan Altaie>so this isn't a final solution,
this is just what I've proposed.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3294-3
01:00:11.664 --> 01:00:14.956
<v Marwan Altaie>It's your portal landing page,
you have a tile.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3363-0
01:00:15.836 --> 01:00:18.890
<v Marwan Altaie>Visible to the groups that we assign it
to, you go into that tile.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3363-1
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:21.397
<v Marwan Altaie>The name can change.
This is just what I'm suggesting,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3363-2
01:00:21.397 --> 01:00:23.813
<v Marwan Altaie>so credit control,
but it can be a cashiering title,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3363-3
01:00:23.813 --> 01:00:26.503
<v Marwan Altaie>cashiering, credit control,
whatever you need. Ultimately,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3363-4
01:00:26.503 --> 01:00:29.420
<v Marwan Altaie>it comes down to a form.
So the reason why I was asking all the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3363-5
01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:32.794
<v Marwan Altaie>questions about what data we should
capture gives us a starting point for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3363-6
01:00:32.794 --> 01:00:34.116
<v Marwan Altaie>this, but also to understand.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3410-0
01:00:34.436 --> 01:00:38.571
<v Marwan Altaie>What is actually beneficial to you guys
and what's not once that's submitted?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3410-1
01:00:38.571 --> 01:00:41.964
<v Marwan Altaie>So this is your cashier,
your whoever wants to submit the form.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3410-2
01:00:41.964 --> 01:00:44.986
<v Marwan Altaie>These six items are just what I've
suggested. But again,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3410-3
01:00:44.986 --> 01:00:48.432
<v Marwan Altaie>the naming can change,
but ultimately what we want to get to and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3410-4
01:00:48.432 --> 01:00:52.196
<v Marwan Altaie>this is coming down to your workflows is
that we have different again.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3455-0
01:00:52.556 --> 01:00:55.482
<v Marwan Altaie>These are just names I've suggested you
have drop downs in the system.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3455-1
01:00:55.482 --> 01:00:58.819
<v Marwan Altaie>You have fields you can add or remove in
the system and this comes across to any</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3455-2
01:00:58.819 --> 01:01:01.127
<v Marwan Altaie>of your scenarios.
There's going to be your cashiering.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3455-3
01:01:01.127 --> 01:01:04.548
<v Marwan Altaie>This can be your credit control and this
again needs to align with the rest of the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3455-4
01:01:04.548 --> 01:01:07.844
<v Marwan Altaie>team in terms of Josh and Deborah because
they're also doing certain items that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3455-5
01:01:07.844 --> 01:01:08.916
<v Marwan Altaie>interlink with cashiering.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3506-0
01:01:09.316 --> 01:01:12.073
<v Marwan Altaie>But in theory,
if you want a decision path Park allocate</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3506-1
01:01:12.073 --> 01:01:15.894
<v Marwan Altaie>change that to allocate. We can do that.
We can add fields and define that and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3506-2
01:01:15.894 --> 01:01:19.958
<v Marwan Altaie>then set the routing so the status again,
this is just what I suggested with credit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3506-3
01:01:19.958 --> 01:01:22.183
<v Marwan Altaie>control,
but that could easily be a different</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3506-4
01:01:22.183 --> 01:01:25.956
<v Marwan Altaie>assignment group based on what you've
selected and we can drive that routing.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3509-0
01:01:27.636 --> 01:01:29.716
<v Marwan Altaie>Hopefully that makes sense.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3514-0
01:01:33.316 --> 01:01:34.476
<v Marwan Altaie>So we've got this one.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3518-0
01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:38.476
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3519-0
01:01:41.756 --> 01:01:41.996
<v Marwan Altaie>Umm.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3536-0
01:01:44.356 --> 01:01:47.534
<v Marwan Altaie>We showed you can't change amounts of
them,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3536-1
01:01:47.534 --> 01:01:51.436
<v Marwan Altaie>assuming you can then raise a new task
site and link.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3591-0
01:01:52.756 --> 01:01:56.445
<v Marwan Altaie>You can we can also,
I mean it's it's not the most favourable</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3591-1
01:01:56.445 --> 01:02:00.968
<v Marwan Altaie>because of controls and security,
but we we can always have override and we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3591-2
01:02:00.968 --> 01:02:05.848
<v Marwan Altaie>can have senior stakeholders or owners of
these processes or we could even create</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3591-3
01:02:05.848 --> 01:02:10.489
<v Marwan Altaie>separate fields saying numbers adjusted
or fields adjusted and it keeps it on</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3591-4
01:02:10.489 --> 01:02:12.156
<v Marwan Altaie>that audit trail so there's.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3594-0
01:02:12.196 --> 01:02:14.916
<v Marwan Altaie>Ways around it. OK, that's fine, I guess.
Yeah, that's fine.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3634-0
01:02:17.596 --> 01:02:21.123
<v Marwan Altaie>We'll go back to the main process,
but I just wanted to kind of give you a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3634-1
01:02:21.123 --> 01:02:25.026
<v Marwan Altaie>look and feel ones aligned with what you
were saying in terms of the workflows and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3634-2
01:02:25.026 --> 01:02:27.706
<v Marwan Altaie>structures. But again,
we need to identify all the as is</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3634-3
01:02:27.706 --> 01:02:31.516
<v Marwan Altaie>processes to get this set up correctly.
And so I'll go back to the process maps.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3635-0
01:02:36.436 --> 01:02:36.716
<v Marwan Altaie>Oh wow.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3672-0
01:02:41.316 --> 01:02:47.520
<v Marwan Altaie>So we're unlocked account and so in terms
of workflows and next steps for the most</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3672-1
01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:53.424
<v Marwan Altaie>part it seems like a digitization option
of your current process would be more</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3672-2
01:02:53.424 --> 01:02:57.162
<v Marwan Altaie>beneficial at this stage.
And then based on that,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3672-3
01:02:57.162 --> 01:02:58.956
<v Marwan Altaie>we could set up routing.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3700-0
01:03:01.116 --> 01:03:04.143
<v Marwan Altaie>The routing and ownership,
it sounds like we've just focused on</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3700-1
01:03:04.143 --> 01:03:06.461
<v Marwan Altaie>Australia.
I mean this is an Australian process,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3700-2
01:03:06.461 --> 01:03:10.150
<v Marwan Altaie>but does the routing for the most part
make sense from step by step or have I</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3700-3
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:13.036
<v Marwan Altaie>not accounted for certain scenarios that
we need to include?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3735-0
01:03:15.556 --> 01:03:18.167
<v Marwan Altaie>Again,
this is a 80% accounted for 20% there</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3735-1
01:03:18.167 --> 01:03:22.055
<v Marwan Altaie>probably will be some nuances,
but we want to automate what we can</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3735-2
01:03:22.055 --> 01:03:26.291
<v Marwan Altaie>correctly 1st and then we could
potentially add in more workflows in the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3735-3
01:03:26.291 --> 01:03:31.107
<v Marwan Altaie>future. We'll put these refunds over here.
Do you if you want to return the funds,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3735-4
01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:33.196
<v Marwan Altaie>does anyone do it? Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3736-0
01:03:34.316 --> 01:03:34.436
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3737-0
01:03:37.556 --> 01:03:37.676
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3750-0
01:03:41.076 --> 01:03:44.848
<v Marwan Altaie>Do you want any evidence, Chris, like,
do you do you need any evidence?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3750-1
01:03:44.848 --> 01:03:46.316
<v Marwan Altaie>Like any attachments or any?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3765-0
01:03:47.876 --> 01:03:51.106
<v Marwan Altaie>Because of the,
the comments would be in the in the tasks.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3765-1
01:03:51.106 --> 01:03:54.556
<v Marwan Altaie>I think that's OK OK,
just give the routing ownership cashing.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3766-0
01:03:56.876 --> 01:03:57.116
<v Marwan Altaie>It's OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3767-0
01:04:01.276 --> 01:04:01.516
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3772-0
01:04:03.876 --> 01:04:05.156
<v Marwan Altaie>I hate to write cashier's review.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3777-0
01:04:16.836 --> 01:04:18.076
<v Marwan Altaie>You don't want any partner.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3801-0
01:04:19.396 --> 01:04:23.468
<v Marwan Altaie>And outside of just the two and from with
all right 'cause.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3801-1
01:04:23.468 --> 01:04:27.201
<v Marwan Altaie>There's a little partner approves
question Mark there.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3801-2
01:04:27.201 --> 01:04:30.934
<v Marwan Altaie>We don't really want the partners to
approve anything.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3801-3
01:04:30.934 --> 01:04:34.396
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we notice that we need to approve is
if we are.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3813-0
01:04:37.276 --> 01:04:41.556
<v Marwan Altaie>Transferring for imposed a client account
which happens very rarely in Australia.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3809-0
01:04:40.196 --> 01:04:40.716
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>If we bar.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3834-0
01:04:41.956 --> 01:04:45.814
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>If we were doing a refund from the client
account after doing an office decline,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3834-1
01:04:45.814 --> 01:04:49.196
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>which is happens pretty frequently and we
would need partner approval.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3841-0
01:04:53.276 --> 01:04:55.676
<v Marwan Altaie>Was saying we do want partner approval in
the process or is that?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3891-0
01:04:56.236 --> 01:04:59.940
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Only for a certain outcome.
So one of the outcomes is we move money</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3891-1
01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:02.392
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>from our office account to a client
account.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3891-2
01:05:02.392 --> 01:05:06.695
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>But from there we could then move the
money back to the office account against</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3891-3
01:05:06.695 --> 01:05:09.528
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>invoices.
Once we've established what the funds are</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3891-4
01:05:09.528 --> 01:05:10.836
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>for, or we could refund.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3914-0
01:05:11.516 --> 01:05:15.853
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Funds back to the to the PR somewhere in
the situation where we're doing a refund,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3914-1
01:05:15.853 --> 01:05:19.720
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we would need partner approval,
but we wouldn't need partner approval for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3914-2
01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.556
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>any other steps.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3948-0
01:05:21.716 --> 01:05:24.643
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.
So could you attach the partner approval</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3948-1
01:05:24.643 --> 01:05:29.911
<v Marwan Altaie>task to the decision path of return? Yeah,
there probably wouldn't be a decision</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3948-2
01:05:29.911 --> 01:05:32.578
<v Marwan Altaie>path,
it would probably just be sorry it</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3948-3
01:05:32.578 --> 01:05:36.676
<v Marwan Altaie>wouldn't be a state,
it would just be a state, yeah, straight.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3949-0
01:05:38.196 --> 01:05:38.316
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3950-0
01:05:39.316 --> 01:05:39.436
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3986-0
01:05:40.276 --> 01:05:42.214
<v Marwan Altaie>Again, the solution, by the way,
that's not set.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3986-1
01:05:42.214 --> 01:05:43.954
<v Marwan Altaie>So that's just kind of to give you
options.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3986-2
01:05:43.954 --> 01:05:46.446
<v Marwan Altaie>So if you're not happy if you want to
change it, feel free to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3986-3
01:05:46.446 --> 01:05:49.214
<v Marwan Altaie>I think what we're just saying is you
don't want partner approval and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3986-4
01:05:49.214 --> 01:05:51.073
<v Marwan Altaie>everything.
So we don't want to build into the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3986-5
01:05:51.073 --> 01:05:53.683
<v Marwan Altaie>workflow, but decision path,
certain decisions need to allocate a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3986-6
01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:54.356
<v Marwan Altaie>partner approval.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/3993-0
01:05:57.116 --> 01:05:58.956
<v Marwan Altaie>Under the decision pass to be one.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4003-0
01:06:01.876 --> 01:06:06.334
<v Marwan Altaie>Transfer to suspense account Anna,
is that another outcome we might have?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4003-1
01:06:06.334 --> 01:06:06.636
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4009-0
01:06:07.796 --> 01:06:09.596
<v Marwan Altaie>Rather than just transfer a client
account.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4010-0
01:06:11.276 --> 01:06:12.156
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4011-0
01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:13.756
<v Marwan Altaie>That.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4034-0
01:06:15.116 --> 01:06:21.481
<v Marwan Altaie>So I'm assuming we can't.
So that allocate part is kind of the the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4034-1
01:06:21.481 --> 01:06:28.131
<v Marwan Altaie>other part of that is suspense. OK, yeah.
If it's partial allocation,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4034-2
01:06:28.131 --> 01:06:30.316
<v Marwan Altaie>then the other part is.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4074-0
01:06:30.636 --> 01:06:34.518
<v Marwan Altaie>Return of funds or it.
It's gotta gotta go to suspense first.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4074-1
01:06:34.518 --> 01:06:39.215
<v Marwan Altaie>Regardless. OK, so that's your reason,
really. There. Yeah, I think. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4074-2
01:06:39.215 --> 01:06:43.160
<v Marwan Altaie>So before it can be refunded,
transferred to client account or</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4074-3
01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.915
<v Marwan Altaie>reallocated.
It's gotta hit suspense first.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4074-4
01:06:45.915 --> 01:06:47.356
<v Marwan Altaie>So that's our step one.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4080-0
01:06:48.196 --> 01:06:51.156
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we want to include that in that or is
that just an action that's completed?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4137-0
01:06:52.476 --> 01:06:56.752
<v Marwan Altaie>That's part of the decision CC decision
to allocate for when you've got allocate</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4137-1
01:06:56.752 --> 01:06:59.181
<v Marwan Altaie>part.
The other part of that allocate part is</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4137-2
01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:02.665
<v Marwan Altaie>the other part suspense,
to allocate part of the receipt and then</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4137-3
01:07:02.665 --> 01:07:06.255
<v Marwan Altaie>part of the suspense. Yeah.
So it's a it's a single decision point.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4137-4
01:07:06.255 --> 01:07:10.109
<v Marwan Altaie>It just needs to include both and then
the amount that you're putting in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4137-5
01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:12.116
<v Marwan Altaie>suspense needs to be included as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4170-0
01:07:14.716 --> 01:07:18.035
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes,
and this is where we were talking about</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4170-1
01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:23.199
<v Marwan Altaie>the amounts changing because your
original question is I've got 5000,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4170-2
01:07:23.199 --> 01:07:28.289
<v Marwan Altaie>I can only allocate 2 1/2.
So the task is still going to have a 5000</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4170-3
01:07:28.289 --> 01:07:29.396
<v Marwan Altaie>assigned to it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4202-0
01:07:30.116 --> 01:07:35.025
<v Marwan Altaie>That you're applying 2 1/2,
so this is where you need to be able to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4202-1
01:07:35.025 --> 01:07:40.802
<v Marwan Altaie>change them with that decision. Yeah,
because then that suspense item has to be</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4202-2
01:07:40.802 --> 01:07:46.650
<v Marwan Altaie>assigned to back to a credit controller
to then further investigate for the next</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4202-3
01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:47.156
<v Marwan Altaie>action.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4206-0
01:07:48.156 --> 01:07:49.636
<v Marwan Altaie>So is it possible that?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4213-0
01:07:50.956 --> 01:07:54.556
<v Marwan Altaie>You have a payment that comes in through
your investigation.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4266-0
01:07:55.876 --> 01:07:58.946
<v Marwan Altaie>Right, I found a £5000 payment,
2 1/2 of it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4266-1
01:07:58.946 --> 01:08:02.153
<v Marwan Altaie>I know what's happening with it,
so you go in.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4266-2
01:08:02.153 --> 01:08:07.815
<v Marwan Altaie>Your next task is I want to allocate part
of this to do XY and Z. You allocate it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4266-3
01:08:07.815 --> 01:08:11.227
<v Marwan Altaie>change the amount to 2 1/2 and that
allocates it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4266-4
01:08:11.227 --> 01:08:15.116
<v Marwan Altaie>removes it from the overall balance and
then the system.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4296-0
01:08:15.196 --> 01:08:18.901
<v Marwan Altaie>Then prompts you to say, OK,
So what you're doing with the other 2 1/2</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4296-1
01:08:18.901 --> 01:08:22.398
<v Marwan Altaie>and then make a decision on that.
Can you do it that way? You can.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4296-2
01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:25.895
<v Marwan Altaie>But then the question is where is the
kind of system total amount?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4296-3
01:08:25.895 --> 01:08:29.236
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that based on digitising a report or
is that a manual entry?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4315-0
01:08:30.756 --> 01:08:35.634
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we want to have that as a kind of
updated documents or is it just a one off</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4315-1
01:08:35.634 --> 01:08:40.142
<v Marwan Altaie>once the ticket is submitted like a
reference to the total amount on the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4315-2
01:08:40.142 --> 01:08:40.636
<v Marwan Altaie>invoice?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4324-0
01:08:43.116 --> 01:08:46.036
<v Marwan Altaie>I think from a ticket perspective,
it's a one off, is it not?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4364-0
01:08:49.276 --> 01:08:51.990
<v Marwan Altaie>So is the is the request comes in for
that amount.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4364-1
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:56.355
<v Marwan Altaie>We just need to be able to see an audit
trail of what's happened with that amount</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4364-2
01:08:56.355 --> 01:08:59.655
<v Marwan Altaie>to get to a 0 balance.
So you're not having to tie it back to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4364-3
01:08:59.655 --> 01:09:02.956
<v Marwan Altaie>any other data because you're manually
inputting that anyway.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4377-0
01:09:04.916 --> 01:09:11.396
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, I mean, we don't, we wouldn't.
I said this process as a whole would not.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4386-0
01:09:12.676 --> 01:09:17.556
<v Marwan Altaie>Have any three integration? Yeah.
There's nothing. The only integration.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4441-0
01:09:19.716 --> 01:09:23.748
<v Marwan Altaie>That would be beneficial is if we could
upload an excerpt of the bank statement</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4441-1
01:09:23.748 --> 01:09:27.679
<v Marwan Altaie>that is unallocated in the first instance.
So that's one thing of digitising.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4441-2
01:09:27.679 --> 01:09:31.056
<v Marwan Altaie>If you send that across,
we can identify the column names and what</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4441-3
01:09:31.056 --> 01:09:34.887
<v Marwan Altaie>data would need to go in. But again,
I don't think it'll be an integration.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4441-4
01:09:34.887 --> 01:09:38.516
<v Marwan Altaie>It probably would be some form of manual
upload and then change manual.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4473-0
01:09:38.596 --> 01:09:40.852
<v Marwan Altaie>Management.
You're maintaining the piece now and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4473-1
01:09:40.852 --> 01:09:43.753
<v Marwan Altaie>ServiceNow and that's that's it.
That's your car across? Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4473-2
01:09:43.753 --> 01:09:47.713
<v Marwan Altaie>I think that would be, that would be fine.
Like, if that's what without having, like,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4473-3
01:09:47.713 --> 01:09:50.568
<v Marwan Altaie>an electronic integration,
like a manual upload would be. No,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4473-4
01:09:50.568 --> 01:09:52.824
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't.
I don't be an issue no harder than what</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4473-5
01:09:52.824 --> 01:09:54.436
<v Marwan Altaie>we're doing now. But we don't have.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4509-0
01:09:54.596 --> 01:10:00.075
<v Marwan Altaie>To link the figures in ServiceNow back to
what is in three E if that makes things</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4509-1
01:10:00.075 --> 01:10:03.750
<v Marwan Altaie>easier, it would,
but then what's driving this is just</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4509-2
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:08.962
<v Marwan Altaie>going to be your your data capture.
That's the thing because you said you let</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4509-3
01:10:08.962 --> 01:10:12.036
<v Marwan Altaie>people change amounts and stuff.
User ID art.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4549-0
01:10:12.716 --> 01:10:15.114
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah,
very dangerous road to go down because</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4549-1
01:10:15.114 --> 01:10:19.058
<v Marwan Altaie>then you suddenly you lost all control of
the amounts, haven't you? Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4549-2
01:10:19.058 --> 01:10:21.722
<v Marwan Altaie>but I mean, I don't want someone.
You're not. We.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4549-3
01:10:21.722 --> 01:10:25.399
<v Marwan Altaie>Maybe that's where the cash is.
Only have the only control to do it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4549-4
01:10:25.399 --> 01:10:29.343
<v Marwan Altaie>Credit control. Give the instruction.
But because cash is other team that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4549-5
01:10:29.343 --> 01:10:30.356
<v Marwan Altaie>actually actioning.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4605-0
01:10:30.636 --> 01:10:33.366
<v Marwan Altaie>This and managing the split based off the
instruction.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4605-1
01:10:33.366 --> 01:10:37.388
<v Marwan Altaie>Then we would be the only ones to make
edits. If we can provide that permission.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4605-2
01:10:37.388 --> 01:10:41.062
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean it's not really that much
different. No, it's not the spreadsheet,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4605-3
01:10:41.062 --> 01:10:45.133
<v Marwan Altaie>it's actually the right way of doing it,
because what happens is we give you part</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4605-4
01:10:45.133 --> 01:10:49.055
<v Marwan Altaie>allocation part allocation comes back
because you say I've allocated for a bit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4605-5
01:10:49.055 --> 01:10:50.396
<v Marwan Altaie>of it now back over to you.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4641-0
01:10:50.596 --> 01:10:55.509
<v Marwan Altaie>Assign it to the credit controller,
which kind of makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4641-1
01:10:55.509 --> 01:10:59.964
<v Marwan Altaie>I think the action, yeah,
whoever is actioning that split has to be</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4641-2
01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:04.878
<v Marwan Altaie>the one to change that. Yeah, I agree.
And I'm and then if it's a mistake,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4641-3
01:11:04.878 --> 01:11:06.516
<v Marwan Altaie>is made in either system.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4646-0
01:11:07.476 --> 01:11:12.156
<v Marwan Altaie>The responsibility lies only with 1-2.
Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4692-0
01:11:14.116 --> 01:11:16.857
<v Marwan Altaie>So let's discuss what would be good entry
point.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4692-1
01:11:16.857 --> 01:11:20.942
<v Marwan Altaie>That must be where the responsibility
says just now that we it is. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4692-2
01:11:20.942 --> 01:11:23.460
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's nothing different like the
anything.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4692-3
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:27.936
<v Marwan Altaie>The only thing that credit control update
in our spreadsheets are the comments,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4692-4
01:11:27.936 --> 01:11:31.070
<v Marwan Altaie>nothing else.
They shouldn't be touching anything else.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4692-5
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:33.756
<v Marwan Altaie>So which is ultimately what we're still
trying.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4722-0
01:11:33.796 --> 01:11:36.444
<v Marwan Altaie>I recreate here.
All we're doing is passing to you for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4722-1
01:11:36.444 --> 01:11:38.852
<v Marwan Altaie>information, update the work notes,
pass it back,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4722-2
01:11:38.852 --> 01:11:41.789
<v Marwan Altaie>and then you should take the action. Yeah,
for sure. Martin.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4722-3
01:11:41.789 --> 01:11:43.956
<v Marwan Altaie>Does that work for you from Auk
perspective?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4764-0
01:11:44.356 --> 01:11:49.062
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So it's using the same scenario in the UK.
We we could have 5 grand that comes in 2</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4764-1
01:11:49.062 --> 01:11:53.264
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>1/2 gets allocated to an invoice and
we've got two and a half 1000 LB left</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4764-2
01:11:53.264 --> 01:11:56.009
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>rather than us putting it to a suspense
account.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4764-3
01:11:56.009 --> 01:12:00.659
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We would move it to a client account and
allocate against the specific matter that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4764-4
01:12:00.659 --> 01:12:01.276
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>relates to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4809-0
01:12:02.556 --> 01:12:05.372
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.
I would then say that that action for the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4809-1
01:12:05.372 --> 01:12:10.125
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>2 1/2 grand this went to the clinic and
still sets with credit control to either</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4809-2
01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:14.525
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>establish can we use the funds against
other invoices or do I have to do a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4809-3
01:12:14.525 --> 01:12:17.342
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>refund. So yeah,
please kind of the same route,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4795-0
01:12:16.316 --> 01:12:16.596
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4809-4
01:12:17.342 --> 01:12:20.276
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but just in a different way of doing it.
So yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4842-0
01:12:19.876 --> 01:12:23.845
<v Marwan Altaie>Credit controller just providing the
information around that though. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4813-0
01:12:22.876 --> 01:12:23.676
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Exactly, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4842-1
01:12:23.845 --> 01:12:27.709
<v Marwan Altaie>says with that the trust stuff can run
from three though Stephen's team,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4842-2
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:31.150
<v Marwan Altaie>do they run the reports from three the
Trust reports, don't you?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4842-3
01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:34.961
<v Marwan Altaie>And so that's all three outside.
You don't actually need ServiceNow for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4842-4
01:12:34.961 --> 01:12:35.596
<v Marwan Altaie>that at all.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4853-0
01:12:36.076 --> 01:12:38.097
<v Marwan Altaie>I think that's fine,
but on the Australian side,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4853-1
01:12:38.097 --> 01:12:41.026
<v Marwan Altaie>with the suspense allocated,
you do because that's where you lose your</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4853-2
01:12:41.026 --> 01:12:41.356
<v Marwan Altaie>control.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4888-0
01:12:43.916 --> 01:12:46.002
<v Marwan Altaie>So for the most part,
it's the same process,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4888-1
01:12:46.002 --> 01:12:48.505
<v Marwan Altaie>but just one has suspense and one is
going to client.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4888-2
01:12:48.505 --> 01:12:52.029
<v Marwan Altaie>But in terms of you have to notify and
the workflow it's are we saying it's</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4888-3
01:12:52.029 --> 01:12:54.996
<v Marwan Altaie>credit control cashiering and that's more
or less the workflow.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4889-0
01:12:57.196 --> 01:12:57.436
<v Marwan Altaie>Umm.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4934-0
01:13:00.636 --> 01:13:02.804
<v Marwan Altaie>You mean in terms and who of who's
involved in it?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4934-1
01:13:02.804 --> 01:13:05.483
<v Marwan Altaie>It'll only be those two teams. Yeah. Yeah.
Because you're not.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4934-2
01:13:05.483 --> 01:13:07.950
<v Marwan Altaie>Although we may need to ask partners.
We're not going to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4934-3
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.926
<v Marwan Altaie>We'll do that by picking up the phone or
something. You should do it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4934-4
01:13:10.926 --> 01:13:14.158
<v Marwan Altaie>You don't need to record it in ServiceNow.
There should. Yeah, that's fine.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4934-5
01:13:14.158 --> 01:13:17.347
<v Marwan Altaie>There shouldn't be any other application
requests coming from anyone else.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4934-6
01:13:17.347 --> 01:13:19.516
<v Marwan Altaie>Everything should be going through credit
control.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4955-0
01:13:19.636 --> 01:13:24.478
<v Marwan Altaie>From an Australian perspective,
who does so if you're going to supposing</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4955-1
01:13:24.478 --> 01:13:29.453
<v Marwan Altaie>you're going to bounce back a payment,
or you're going to send back half a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4955-2
01:13:29.453 --> 01:13:32.836
<v Marwan Altaie>payment. So for suspense,
who does that in the UK?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4963-0
01:13:36.676 --> 01:13:40.236
<v Marwan Altaie>And cash it and you process it here.
Martin, do you press all returns?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4965-0
01:13:43.716 --> 01:13:44.556
<v Marwan Altaie>Or all refunds.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4967-0
01:13:49.796 --> 01:13:50.876
<v Marwan Altaie>Have I lost you, Martin?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5014-0
01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:57.862
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Sorry, put myself on mute.
Just talking away to myself. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/4975-0
01:13:54.636 --> 01:13:56.076
<v Marwan Altaie>See if it's. Oh, there it is.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5014-1
01:13:57.862 --> 01:14:01.971
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>so the credit control team would fill out
a payment form for us and pass that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5014-2
01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:05.290
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>payment form on to my team.
And we would then pass it off to a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5014-3
01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:08.925
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>partner for them to approve,
and then we would process the the funds</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5014-4
01:14:08.925 --> 01:14:10.716
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>out the same way we would do with.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5022-0
01:14:11.436 --> 01:14:14.796
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Any client payment request kind of what
we spoke about last Wednesday.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5064-0
01:14:15.716 --> 01:14:18.581
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. OK. And the same on the UK.
So if we're going to,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5064-1
01:14:18.581 --> 01:14:22.316
<v Marwan Altaie>if it's comes back suspense and we're
returning the payment to the team,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5064-2
01:14:22.316 --> 01:14:26.102
<v Marwan Altaie>to the team, complete the formula,
I'll just take you to send it back the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5064-3
01:14:26.102 --> 01:14:29.940
<v Marwan Altaie>banking details. That's what I approve,
isn't it? Yeah, that's yeah. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5064-4
01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:32.396
<v Marwan Altaie>We credit control.
We just need to comment and.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5111-0
01:14:34.316 --> 01:14:37.165
<v Marwan Altaie>OK,
I don't really know if you wanna build in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5111-1
01:14:37.165 --> 01:14:40.819
<v Marwan Altaie>an approval process through ServiceNow,
Chris or the team.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5111-2
01:14:40.819 --> 01:14:45.898
<v Marwan Altaie>Just attach your approval plus the bank
details and then my team can just just to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5111-3
01:14:45.898 --> 01:14:48.500
<v Marwan Altaie>add,
we can also all the functionality we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5111-4
01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:52.836
<v Marwan Altaie>talked about for the other solutions
emails coming out of ServiceNow.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5152-0
01:14:52.996 --> 01:14:57.474
<v Marwan Altaie>Capturing approvals, capturing responses,
we can also do that with the ticketing</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5152-1
01:14:57.474 --> 01:15:00.460
<v Marwan Altaie>system here.
So you don't necessarily need to account</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5152-2
01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:04.054
<v Marwan Altaie>for every nuance or workflow in there.
You could have it, Chris,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5152-3
01:15:04.054 --> 01:15:07.261
<v Marwan Altaie>have you approved it? Yes,
comes back perfect done. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5152-4
01:15:07.261 --> 01:15:11.076
<v Marwan Altaie>might make it a little bit easier.
So if someone sends me an e-mail.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5196-0
01:15:11.636 --> 01:15:14.265
<v Marwan Altaie>I get e-mail requests like.
Can you approve this?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5196-1
01:15:14.265 --> 01:15:18.261
<v Marwan Altaie>It gets attached all the details.
The documents I quickly read through them</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5196-2
01:15:18.261 --> 01:15:21.573
<v Marwan Altaie>I approve fly back approved.
That's it done. I was to do that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5196-3
01:15:21.573 --> 01:15:25.938
<v Marwan Altaie>That would go back to the ticket request
already or ever sent the e-mail from the.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5196-4
01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:29.566
<v Marwan Altaie>So who would send you that e-mail in the
1st place for the approval.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5196-5
01:15:29.566 --> 01:15:31.196
<v Marwan Altaie>It comes from either one of my.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5224-0
01:15:31.356 --> 01:15:35.225
<v Marwan Altaie>Team or cashier's team. OK, Jeremy.
My team. That should all be done in,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5224-1
01:15:35.225 --> 01:15:39.624
<v Marwan Altaie>in ServiceNow then and it just comes into
your workspace as a notification you go,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5224-2
01:15:39.624 --> 01:15:43.811
<v Marwan Altaie>there's all my attachments. That's fine.
So they fill in the form how and then</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5224-3
01:15:43.811 --> 01:15:46.196
<v Marwan Altaie>they do the forms all online, do they?
Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5275-0
01:15:47.316 --> 01:15:51.920
<v Marwan Altaie>Are we in those payment that we talked
about those forms going into ServiceNow</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5275-1
01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:56.175
<v Marwan Altaie>ready? No, no, I don't think so. OK,
as part of the document depository,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5275-2
01:15:56.175 --> 01:16:00.895
<v Marwan Altaie>can we just create structured because I
don't know your refund form is basically</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5275-3
01:16:00.895 --> 01:16:05.033
<v Marwan Altaie>the same across different regions from
what I've seen different. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5275-4
01:16:05.033 --> 01:16:06.316
<v Marwan Altaie>so so we can probably.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5334-0
01:16:06.436 --> 01:16:09.770
<v Marwan Altaie>There are like document repositories or
we can just call them templates and you</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5334-1
01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:12.813
<v Marwan Altaie>just use those templates. Yeah,
I've put there's there'll be a knowledge</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5334-2
01:16:12.813 --> 01:16:16.231
<v Marwan Altaie>base that you can use and then that's a
repository for bringing the templates and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5334-3
01:16:16.231 --> 01:16:19.648
<v Marwan Altaie>storing there for people to use as well.
We don't have to go to multiple systems.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5334-4
01:16:19.648 --> 01:16:21.732
<v Marwan Altaie>You just go in,
everything's centralised for you.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5334-5
01:16:21.732 --> 01:16:24.525
<v Marwan Altaie>You don't need to remember.
Or how about attach this? Can we even,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5334-6
01:16:24.525 --> 01:16:26.276
<v Marwan Altaie>can we create it into the workflow saying?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5368-0
01:16:26.796 --> 01:16:29.857
<v Marwan Altaie>Have you remembered to do this or
creating an attachment?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5368-1
01:16:29.857 --> 01:16:33.341
<v Marwan Altaie>This has more complication. No,
it's probably not worth it. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5368-2
01:16:33.341 --> 01:16:36.772
<v Marwan Altaie>I wouldn't say it's worth it.
I'm just trying to figure out if a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5368-3
01:16:36.772 --> 01:16:39.728
<v Marwan Altaie>template that you're talking about is
outside of. Well,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5368-4
01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:42.156
<v Marwan Altaie>the reason we do it by e-mail is twofold.
So.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5415-0
01:16:42.956 --> 01:16:45.912
<v Marwan Altaie>First of all, it's just easy. Secondly,
it's not just the template.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5415-1
01:16:45.912 --> 01:16:49.215
<v Marwan Altaie>They have to submit that they have to
give me proof of bank details as well</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5415-2
01:16:49.215 --> 01:16:51.606
<v Marwan Altaie>from the client.
So if we're sending money back to the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5415-3
01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:54.171
<v Marwan Altaie>client, I have to get,
I get this form that they fill out.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5415-4
01:16:54.171 --> 01:16:57.214
<v Marwan Altaie>It's got all the details in plus they're,
you know, this is all good.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5415-5
01:16:57.214 --> 01:16:59.996
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that like a word?
Is that like a word form? Is it all? Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5415-6
01:16:59.996 --> 01:17:01.996
<v Marwan Altaie>It's just a template sent word template
form.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5468-0
01:17:02.356 --> 01:17:05.866
<v Marwan Altaie>And then there's also banking details,
which covers APDF,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5468-1
01:17:05.866 --> 01:17:10.527
<v Marwan Altaie>so they have to go out to the client and
get either a copy of the class bank</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5468-2
01:17:10.527 --> 01:17:14.945
<v Marwan Altaie>statement, a copy of a bank slip,
or an official letter from their bank.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5468-3
01:17:14.945 --> 01:17:18.698
<v Marwan Altaie>With BSB sort code,
I bought all the account details and I'll</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5468-4
01:17:18.698 --> 01:17:20.756
<v Marwan Altaie>verify that those account details.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5496-0
01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:24.557
<v Marwan Altaie>Are the same as what's on the request for,
just as a double check to make sure we're</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5496-1
01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:27.333
<v Marwan Altaie>not refunding back to any move,
and that's where it goes to be for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5496-2
01:17:27.333 --> 01:17:30.191
<v Marwan Altaie>approval, and I review them,
approve when I send off to cashiers and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5496-3
01:17:30.191 --> 01:17:31.476
<v Marwan Altaie>they I can do whatever they do.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5541-0
01:17:33.636 --> 01:17:36.821
<v Marwan Altaie>So they would need to be able to attach
something from the client.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5541-1
01:17:36.821 --> 01:17:39.626
<v Marwan Altaie>They're going to get by e-mail,
like kind of APDF of some.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5541-2
01:17:39.626 --> 01:17:43.240
<v Marwan Altaie>It's usually comes to the PDF format
basically of either a snippet of their</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5541-3
01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:46.473
<v Marwan Altaie>back stack, whatever it might be. Yeah.
And that that's still fine.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5541-4
01:17:46.473 --> 01:17:49.516
<v Marwan Altaie>I think that's in terms of getting the
PDF, getting the e-mail.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5579-0
01:17:50.156 --> 01:17:54.488
<v Marwan Altaie>Attaching that to the request on service
now only being routed to you or someone</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5579-1
01:17:54.488 --> 01:17:58.768
<v Marwan Altaie>within a particular group just because of
sensitivity around kind of having the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5579-2
01:17:58.768 --> 01:18:02.994
<v Marwan Altaie>some of those key personal notification
information. You can then do approval.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5579-3
01:18:02.994 --> 01:18:07.487
<v Marwan Altaie>So you could have a whole you could maybe
have a bucket that says you know awaiting</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5579-4
01:18:07.487 --> 01:18:08.236
<v Marwan Altaie>your approval.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5610-0
01:18:08.796 --> 01:18:12.605
<v Marwan Altaie>And even ones that you've got, you know,
I've approved these is going through even</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5610-1
01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:16.185
<v Marwan Altaie>this generates off the back of that
request to that person who's submits that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5610-2
01:18:16.185 --> 01:18:19.811
<v Marwan Altaie>and it'll say here's all the approval.
You know, here's the approval get done.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5610-3
01:18:19.811 --> 01:18:21.556
<v Marwan Altaie>The cheques all confirmed ready to go.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5628-0
01:18:22.916 --> 01:18:26.946
<v Marwan Altaie>And then those approvals 'cause I send
them to accounts payable then now they</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5628-1
01:18:26.946 --> 01:18:30.512
<v Marwan Altaie>can be done by cashiers. Yeah, yeah,
the they'll be moved. Cashiers,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5628-2
01:18:30.512 --> 01:18:32.476
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't know. Next week when I'm back.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5629-0
01:18:35.276 --> 01:18:35.396
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5662-0
01:18:36.716 --> 01:18:41.287
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool. I'll I'll take those actions away.
One thing I'll just say is we'll just</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5662-1
01:18:41.287 --> 01:18:45.801
<v Marwan Altaie>need to be clear where we expect to
receive ABC that you know like the flight</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5662-2
01:18:45.801 --> 01:18:49.851
<v Marwan Altaie>details, yeah, yeah, et cetera.
Just so it's really clear for them as</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5662-3
01:18:49.851 --> 01:18:51.356
<v Marwan Altaie>well. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5663-0
01:18:51.716 --> 01:18:51.836
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5696-0
01:18:53.236 --> 01:18:57.308
<v Marwan Altaie>What do we need to define based on 1st
for a second? Julian,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5696-1
01:18:57.308 --> 01:19:02.182
<v Marwan Altaie>you know ahead ahead of schedule?
What do we need to define for the form</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5696-2
01:19:02.182 --> 01:19:05.587
<v Marwan Altaie>capture?
We can assume request type region entity,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5696-3
01:19:05.587 --> 01:19:10.727
<v Marwan Altaie>so it's because it's slightly different
depending what action you're taking.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5696-4
01:19:10.727 --> 01:19:11.796
<v Marwan Altaie>So the form for.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5739-0
01:19:12.596 --> 01:19:16.901
<v Marwan Altaie>Cashier is to send to credit control with
unallocated invoices. Is one form. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5739-1
01:19:16.901 --> 01:19:20.637
<v Marwan Altaie>which is what I thought Australia and
reading what this could be. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5739-2
01:19:20.637 --> 01:19:24.476
<v Marwan Altaie>And then you've got other forms that
would be this refund that we're just</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5739-3
01:19:24.476 --> 01:19:27.329
<v Marwan Altaie>talking about.
So so this is just the unallocated one,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5739-4
01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:27.796
<v Marwan Altaie>is it so?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5773-0
01:19:28.436 --> 01:19:31.455
<v Marwan Altaie>Again,
we have a few other processes that do</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5773-1
01:19:31.455 --> 01:19:36.353
<v Marwan Altaie>pick up on refund and return,
so this is purely on the unallocated. Yes,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5773-2
01:19:36.353 --> 01:19:39.708
<v Marwan Altaie>this is our like front facing the first
instance.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5773-3
01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:42.996
<v Marwan Altaie>That cache is a contacting credit control,
yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5778-0
01:19:43.396 --> 01:19:45.676
<v Marwan Altaie>With items that we can't post. Yeah, OK,
cool.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5786-0
01:19:48.916 --> 01:19:50.796
<v Marwan Altaie>What do you currently get on your
forwarding?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5789-0
01:19:54.196 --> 01:19:55.036
<v Marwan Altaie>And allocated, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5790-0
01:20:02.316 --> 01:20:03.156
<v Marwan Altaie>Some Jew.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5809-0
01:20:04.836 --> 01:20:09.672
<v Marwan Altaie>Some receipt.
Sorry it some sort of see any narrative,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5809-1

<v Marwan Altaie>any details that came on? Yeah,
it's pretty much exactly the same. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5809-2
01:20:16.092 --> 01:20:16.356
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5811-0
01:20:18.796 --> 01:20:19.756
<v Marwan Altaie>Some of this stuff.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5823-0
01:20:21.476 --> 01:20:27.096
<v Marwan Altaie>We probably don't know. OK,
so request type or it's an allocated?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5823-1
01:20:27.096 --> 01:20:29.396
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean region entity again.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5835-0
01:20:30.596 --> 01:20:35.996
<v Marwan Altaie>That's probably most helpful in the UK.
It's relevant to you guys, isn't it?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5842-0
01:20:37.876 --> 01:20:41.404

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5842-1
01:20:41.404 --> 01:20:42.196

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5852-0

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5886-0
01:21:07.036 --> 01:21:10.556
<v Marwan Altaie>Any allocation requests for the US,
they go straight to the US, don't they?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5901-0
01:21:10.676 --> 01:21:13.654
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So we we send them to Robert,
who's in the US,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5901-1
01:21:13.654 --> 01:21:17.076
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but we also copy and Donna.
So it's Robert and Donna.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5902-0
01:21:22.516 --> 01:21:22.756
<v Marwan Altaie>Umm.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5943-0
01:21:24.636 --> 01:21:29.213
<v Marwan Altaie>If we had just the region and currency
fields is that Martin,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5943-1
01:21:29.213 --> 01:21:34.751
<v Marwan Altaie>is that enough for you to be able to
identify any type of receipt that you</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5943-2
01:21:34.751 --> 01:21:40.362
<v Marwan Altaie>need to send to UK credit control across
all the regional bank accounts and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5943-3
01:21:40.362 --> 01:21:42.356
<v Marwan Altaie>currencies that you manage?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5996-0
01:21:42.676 --> 01:21:46.352
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah, I think so.
We'd say probably the bottom column isn't</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5996-1
01:21:46.352 --> 01:21:49.416
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>needed.
Suspected client on matter because that's</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5996-2
01:21:49.416 --> 01:21:53.276
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>why we're reaching out to the credit
control in the 1st place.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5967-0
01:21:52.196 --> 01:21:52.436
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5996-3
01:21:53.276 --> 01:21:57.259
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>I don't know if the payment method is is
important in Australia,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5996-4
01:21:57.259 --> 01:22:01.916
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but I don't really see that has been
important to make a difference to use.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/5988-0
01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:01.276
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6003-0
01:22:02.116 --> 01:22:05.636
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So Stephen, if he's new,
if it came by backs or chaps or whatever.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6002-0
01:22:03.996 --> 01:22:04.436
<v Marwan Altaie>Great.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6057-0
01:22:06.956 --> 01:22:11.360
<v Marwan Altaie>Same with payer name. We don't really.
That would probably be covered in the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6057-1
01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:14.677
<v Marwan Altaie>bank reference.
So whatever description or narrative that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6057-2
01:22:14.677 --> 01:22:19.196
<v Marwan Altaie>comes on our bank statement is what I'd
be telling my team to put in that bank</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6057-3
01:22:19.196 --> 01:22:22.055
<v Marwan Altaie>reference,
which may or may not have a payer name</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6057-4
01:22:22.055 --> 01:22:25.316
<v Marwan Altaie>that we know.
So I don't know if that's relevant or not.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6076-0
01:22:25.636 --> 01:22:28.634
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>It was a bit different, Anna.
We get a payment name and we get a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6076-1
01:22:28.634 --> 01:22:31.956
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>reference as well. So it's two separate.
Two separate things in the UK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6080-0
01:22:31.596 --> 01:22:34.436
<v Marwan Altaie>I think you can keep them on there.
So I think you you you keep.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6138-0
01:22:35.996 --> 01:22:38.589
<v Marwan Altaie>Method isn't relevant.
You're not going to attach the bank</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6138-1
01:22:38.589 --> 01:22:41.402
<v Marwan Altaie>statement or remittance,
so you knew that you knew what it was.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6138-2
01:22:41.402 --> 01:22:43.995
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean, suspect reply no,
because you're going to lose the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6138-3
01:22:43.995 --> 01:22:47.072
<v Marwan Altaie>reference if you knew that,
you would never request in the 1st place.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6138-4
01:22:47.072 --> 01:22:49.446
<v Marwan Altaie>So the bottom three,
I would say probably not needed.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6138-5
01:22:49.446 --> 01:22:51.467
<v Marwan Altaie>If we have a copy. If anyone disagrees,
well,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6138-6
01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:54.237
<v Marwan Altaie>if we have a copy of advice that has a
reversed invoice on it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6121-0
01:22:51.756 --> 01:22:51.956
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Pat.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6138-7
01:22:54.237 --> 01:22:55.116
<v Marwan Altaie>is that going to be?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6129-0
01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:54.556
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6153-0
01:22:55.196 --> 01:22:58.811
<v Marwan Altaie>More helpful for you to see,
we would have that remittance advice</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6153-1
01:22:58.811 --> 01:23:01.276
<v Marwan Altaie>already because it'd be a folder.
Well then.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6202-0
01:22:59.196 --> 01:23:01.680
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah,
I I think the bank statement is important</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6202-1
01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:05.821
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>to have as well because we get a lot more
details on our receipts in the UK and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6202-2
01:23:05.821 --> 01:23:09.081
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>what you do in Australia.
Our bank statement will tell us what</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6173-0
01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:07.916
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6202-3
01:23:09.081 --> 01:23:12.704
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>maybe the address of the client is.
It will tell us what country the,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6202-4
01:23:12.704 --> 01:23:16.276
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>the bank worth and all that sort of stuff.
So sometimes having that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6215-0
01:23:17.076 --> 01:23:20.050
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Attachment is probably quite useful to
the credit control team to give them</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6215-1
01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:22.476
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>clues to see what country it's came from
and stuff like that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6271-0
01:23:23.636 --> 01:23:27.216
<v Marwan Altaie>Instead of in general,
it's just good to have an attachment on</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6271-1
01:23:27.216 --> 01:23:31.761
<v Marwan Altaie>any of the forms. Yeah, front end, yeah.
Instead of suspected client or matter.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6271-2
01:23:31.761 --> 01:23:36.421
<v Marwan Altaie>Can we just have like a general comments
section so that we can add in additional</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6271-3
01:23:36.421 --> 01:23:40.626
<v Marwan Altaie>information if we know it? Yeah,
we can help just to open text box saying</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6271-4
01:23:40.626 --> 01:23:42.956
<v Marwan Altaie>any additional support or any additional.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6283-0
01:23:43.236 --> 01:23:47.432
<v Marwan Altaie>Comment information. Yeah, yeah,
like invoice. This was paid on X date.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6283-1
01:23:47.432 --> 01:23:49.996
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah,
but it's also on this room in device.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6285-0
01:23:51.156 --> 01:23:52.156
<v Marwan Altaie>Because that's quite common.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6328-0
01:23:55.716 --> 01:23:59.299
<v Marwan Altaie>So I know that was quite convoluted,
but I think we've got a lot of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6328-1
01:23:59.299 --> 01:24:03.305
<v Marwan Altaie>information that we need to create the
use cases and come back to you with.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6328-2
01:24:03.305 --> 01:24:06.362
<v Marwan Altaie>Is everyone happy?
For the most part with where we're at,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6328-3
01:24:06.362 --> 01:24:10.420
<v Marwan Altaie>there will be additional actions and
additional discussions without a doubt,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6328-4
01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:11.316
<v Marwan Altaie>because that was.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6336-0
01:24:11.956 --> 01:24:16.556
<v Marwan Altaie>I was a complex one,
but I think we're in a good place for now.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6369-0
01:24:18.676 --> 01:24:23.564
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, we get to meet Bob. Yeah, cool.
And I'm gonna leave the hash collection</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6369-1
01:24:23.564 --> 01:24:27.074
<v Marwan Altaie>for now as well.
We're gonna go through the rest of the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6369-2
01:24:27.074 --> 01:24:31.775
<v Marwan Altaie>processes because they do touch on a lot
of processes that this kicks off.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6369-3
01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:34.596
<v Marwan Altaie>So if we get to the granular detail of
that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6413-0
01:24:35.316 --> 01:24:40.349
<v Marwan Altaie>We may not need cash collection because
it's accounted for or we may still want</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6413-1
01:24:40.349 --> 01:24:45.320
<v Marwan Altaie>this to be more of a kick off a separate
process, but we'll come back to this.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6413-2
01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:48.970
<v Marwan Altaie>It might be a future discussion or today
if we have time,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6413-3
01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:52.116
<v Marwan Altaie>it's just I know the Speaking of time,
it's 3:00.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6437-0
01:24:53.196 --> 01:24:58.080
<v Marwan Altaie>I've put in time for a break.
Does everyone want to have 10 minutes</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6437-1
01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:03.107
<v Marwan Altaie>walk around, get refreshed,
and then we come back and continue? Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6437-2
01:25:03.107 --> 01:25:08.781
<v Marwan Altaie>yeah, yeah. Cool. Fantastic. Yeah. Parik,
you're good to go for a break for 10</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6437-3
01:25:08.781 --> 01:25:09.356
<v Marwan Altaie>minutes.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6441-0
01:25:10.436 --> 01:25:12.956
<v Marwan Altaie>Oh, and uh Martin as well. Probably Jesus.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6444-0
01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:14.876
<v Parik Narain>See you later. Bye.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6445-0
01:25:15.876 --> 01:25:16.076
<v Marwan Altaie>Just.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6614-0
01:38:40.596 --> 01:38:41.276
<v Marwan Altaie>Is everyone back?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6617-0
01:38:44.676 --> 01:38:45.716
<v Marwan Altaie>Everyone on the call.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6618-0
01:38:46.396 --> 01:38:46.676
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yep.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6619-0
01:38:47.836 --> 01:38:48.116
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6626-0
01:38:48.116 --> 01:38:54.036
<v Marwan Altaie>Oh, perfect.
Let's kick off the rest of the session.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6648-0
01:39:00.796 --> 01:39:06.110
<v Marwan Altaie>Of course,
we've done that just considering the time,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6648-1
01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:12.311
<v Marwan Altaie>do we want to get into suspense account
now, or do we want to?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6648-2
01:39:12.311 --> 01:39:15.756
<v Marwan Altaie>Are there any other processes that?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6686-0
01:39:17.276 --> 01:39:20.296
<v Marwan Altaie>Relative to the UK,
because this is all specific,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6686-1
01:39:20.296 --> 01:39:25.009
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm just wondering if it's easier for to
cover everything UK related as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6686-2
01:39:25.009 --> 01:39:29.963
<v Marwan Altaie>So then Martin and Steven can pop off if
they need to. Yeah, that's a good point.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6686-3
01:39:29.963 --> 01:39:31.836
<v Marwan Altaie>So let's move on from suspense.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6736-0
01:39:32.276 --> 01:39:36.103
<v Marwan Altaie>I think this is probably a big one for
you guys. Yeah, cool.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6736-1
01:39:36.103 --> 01:39:41.186
<v Marwan Altaie>Let's do rejecting payments and refunds.
So this is where I said you've got your</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6736-2
01:39:41.186 --> 01:39:45.955
<v Marwan Altaie>entire big process and then we're
branching off into individual process and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6736-3
01:39:45.955 --> 01:39:48.841
<v Marwan Altaie>trying to understand those process
workflows.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6736-4
01:39:48.841 --> 01:39:51.916
<v Marwan Altaie>So a receipt is posted identified that
can't be.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6760-0
01:39:52.556 --> 01:39:56.759
<v Marwan Altaie>Allocated or related to a cancelled slash
duplicate bill,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6760-1
01:39:56.759 --> 01:40:02.267
<v Marwan Altaie>is that correct for all scenarios for
rejecting payments or do we have more</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6760-2
01:40:02.267 --> 01:40:04.876
<v Marwan Altaie>kind of scenarios for this use case?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6767-0
01:40:06.516 --> 01:40:09.876
<v Marwan Altaie>This is a receipt comes into office
account.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6768-0
01:40:11.116 --> 01:40:11.676
<v Marwan Altaie>We.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6772-0
01:40:12.956 --> 01:40:15.076
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm gonna send it back to a client.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6773-0
01:40:17.196 --> 01:40:17.316
<v Marwan Altaie>None.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6778-0
01:40:22.996 --> 01:40:24.476
<v Marwan Altaie>Or it gets transferred to a client
account?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6825-0
01:40:30.916 --> 01:40:34.870
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So it's essentially funds that have come
into our account that we don't want to be</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6825-1
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:37.871
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>in an account anymore.
There can be multiple reasons for that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6825-2
01:40:37.871 --> 01:40:41.492
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>It could be we generally have no idea
what the funds are for or who's paid.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6825-3
01:40:41.492 --> 01:40:43.588
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>This could be that that was been
cancelled,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6825-4
01:40:43.588 --> 01:40:46.876
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>it could be a duplicate payment,
but essentially we are saying that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6848-0
01:40:47.836 --> 01:40:51.206
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>The whole 100% of the funds that have
arrived into account,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6848-1
01:40:51.206 --> 01:40:55.812
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we don't need for whatever reason and we
get our banks to return the funds to the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6848-2
01:40:55.812 --> 01:40:58.116
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>person that paid this in the first place.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6872-0
01:41:01.076 --> 01:41:04.566
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. In terms of the roles, handoffs,
approvals,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6872-1
01:41:04.566 --> 01:41:09.872
<v Marwan Altaie>is this how you've understood the
processes as well or do I need to account</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6872-2
01:41:09.872 --> 01:41:12.316
<v Marwan Altaie>for any changes or standardisation?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6885-0
01:41:19.876 --> 01:41:22.716
<v Marwan Altaie>So we've got transfer to transfer to
client account as well, don't we?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6922-0
01:41:24.556 --> 01:41:27.864
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We wouldn't transfer anything to the
client account if it was a rejection.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6922-1
01:41:27.864 --> 01:41:29.893
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We're simply saying we don't want this
money,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6922-2
01:41:29.893 --> 01:41:33.158
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>so it gets taken straight back at our
office account and goes back to the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6922-3
01:41:33.158 --> 01:41:36.157
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>person that sent it to us.
So there's no client account involvement</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6922-4
01:41:36.157 --> 01:41:38.716
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>in this at all.
I'm sorry you're sending refunds as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6923-0
01:41:39.556 --> 01:41:39.876
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6925-0
01:41:40.196 --> 01:41:40.956
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Almost.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6955-0
01:41:42.276 --> 01:41:45.684
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Combining 2 processes here, so yeah,
if we're rejecting funds and we don't</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6955-1
01:41:45.684 --> 01:41:48.546
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>know what they're for,
it wouldn't go into the client account.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6955-2
01:41:48.546 --> 01:41:51.818
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>But if we've moved the funds to the
client account for whatever reason,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6955-3
01:41:51.818 --> 01:41:53.636
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>then yeah, we would have to do a refund.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7002-0
01:41:54.276 --> 01:41:58.471
<v Marwan Altaie>I think they could bind 2 processes when
they did this process process about</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6964-0
01:41:58.316 --> 01:41:58.876
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah. OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7002-1
01:41:58.471 --> 01:42:01.140
<v Marwan Altaie>Martin.
Some reason they I don't know why but it</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7002-2
01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:05.063
<v Marwan Altaie>was combined so because transfer to
client account is almost a separate</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7002-3
01:42:05.063 --> 01:42:08.985
<v Marwan Altaie>process in itself, isn't it really?
It's triggered from this process it</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/6985-0
01:42:06.676 --> 01:42:08.196
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah, yeah, that's two.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7002-4
01:42:08.985 --> 01:42:12.636
<v Marwan Altaie>potentially or from so we give our whole
workflow separate so the.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7019-0
01:42:13.036 --> 01:42:16.259
<v Marwan Altaie>So if you imagine the ticket,
it ends with transfer to client and then</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7019-1
01:42:16.259 --> 01:42:19.528
<v Marwan Altaie>we can have a sub task where we can
create a separate process where the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7019-2
01:42:19.528 --> 01:42:22.116
<v Marwan Altaie>transfer actions are as part of. Yeah,
that makes sense.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7042-0
01:42:24.036 --> 01:42:30.161
<v Marwan Altaie>Does that work for Australia as well?
Any return transcript? Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7042-1
01:42:30.161 --> 01:42:37.110
<v Marwan Altaie>I think there's two, I guess, yeah.
There's two different processes in here</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7042-2
01:42:37.110 --> 01:42:38.756
<v Marwan Altaie>for Australia, so.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7055-0
01:42:39.396 --> 01:42:44.090
<v Marwan Altaie>Rather than rejecting the payment,
we would refer to it as a a return of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7055-1
01:42:44.090 --> 01:42:44.476
<v Marwan Altaie>funds.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7095-0
01:42:47.156 --> 01:42:51.178
<v Marwan Altaie>And then the refund has to happen via a
suspense process,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7095-1
01:42:51.178 --> 01:42:56.794
<v Marwan Altaie>so I wouldn't classify the refund as part
of the Australian process or I I would</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7095-2
01:42:56.794 --> 01:43:01.302
<v Marwan Altaie>classify the refund. Sorry.
As an arm of the Australian suspense</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7095-3
01:43:01.302 --> 01:43:05.116
<v Marwan Altaie>process. OK, fine.
That's a decision through suspense.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7139-0
01:43:05.476 --> 01:43:08.522
<v Marwan Altaie>But we can return funds directly through
our bank.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7139-1
01:43:08.522 --> 01:43:13.301
<v Marwan Altaie>So this is more so UK and rest of the
world focused Australia's version of this</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7139-2
01:43:13.301 --> 01:43:18.139
<v Marwan Altaie>is a bit more suspense based where fine
and I'm assuming it's a legal compliance</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7139-3
01:43:18.139 --> 01:43:20.767
<v Marwan Altaie>thing.
You have to go through with suspense</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7139-4
01:43:20.767 --> 01:43:23.396
<v Marwan Altaie>first before or is that just a
operational?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7165-0
01:43:23.796 --> 01:43:28.042
<v Marwan Altaie>No, it's an operational.
It's just the UK process is more driven</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7165-1
01:43:28.042 --> 01:43:31.636
<v Marwan Altaie>by the SRA than Australia's driven by our
regulations.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7201-0
01:43:33.396 --> 01:43:35.563
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>For the purposes of chatting about this
part,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7201-1
01:43:35.563 --> 01:43:39.379
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>it might be easier just to fragment it in
the two processes and just say this is</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7201-2
01:43:39.379 --> 01:43:43.101
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>what we do for rejecting payments and
talk about that and then talk about what</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7201-3
01:43:43.101 --> 01:43:45.315
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we do for refunds because there's there's
two,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7201-4
01:43:45.315 --> 01:43:48.236
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>two different tasks have been combined in
the one slide here.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7212-0
01:43:49.956 --> 01:43:52.437
<v Marwan Altaie>So are we.
Are you suggesting we separate these two</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7212-1
01:43:52.437 --> 01:43:52.676
<v Marwan Altaie>then?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7213-0
01:43:52.756 --> 01:43:52.876
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7215-0
01:43:53.076 --> 01:43:54.156
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah, I would say so.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7243-0
01:43:54.716 --> 01:43:59.108
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, can take that as an action,
but I guess whilst we're here discussing</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7243-1
01:43:59.108 --> 01:44:01.756
<v Marwan Altaie>it,
should we focus on rejecting first and?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7263-0
01:44:01.196 --> 01:44:03.292
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah,
I think that's the easiest because I</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7263-1
01:44:03.292 --> 01:44:06.266
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>think the rejecting is probably quite an
easy, easy process.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7263-2
01:44:06.266 --> 01:44:10.019
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Is it still the same for you as Anna,
where you simply send an e-mail to the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7263-3
01:44:10.019 --> 01:44:13.286
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>bank after credit control,
tell you that they don't want the funds</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7263-4
01:44:13.286 --> 01:44:13.676
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>anymore?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7279-0
01:44:14.676 --> 01:44:18.080
<v Marwan Altaie>We initiate it directly through the
banking platform,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7274-0
01:44:18.076 --> 01:44:18.396
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7279-1
01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:20.476
<v Marwan Altaie>so we don't have to send it now, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7315-0
01:44:20.956 --> 01:44:23.910
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So I think that's where the only
difference is going to be,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7315-1
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:27.603
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but essentially got the same path where
this is unallocated funds we like.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7315-2
01:44:27.603 --> 01:44:30.558
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We just spoke about,
we send the request to credit control,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7315-3
01:44:30.558 --> 01:44:33.069
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>credit control come back and say reject
the funds,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7315-4
01:44:33.069 --> 01:44:35.876
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>what's going to happen next is going to
depend on which.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7350-0
01:44:36.596 --> 01:44:40.374
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Country receive the funds because it's
different.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7316-0
01:44:36.636 --> 01:44:36.876
<v Marwan Altaie>Hmm.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7350-1
01:44:40.374 --> 01:44:46.798
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>It's a different process for each country.
So and has just told you to do it through</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7350-2
01:44:46.798 --> 01:44:50.728
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>the ANZ banking platform in the UK we
have to sign,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7350-3
01:44:50.728 --> 01:44:53.676
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>send a signed document off to our bank.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7395-0
01:44:54.636 --> 01:44:58.136
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Based on the mandate that we've got at
that bank, so we,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7395-1
01:44:58.136 --> 01:45:01.514
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we've got partners down in London that
I've got, yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7395-2
01:45:01.514 --> 01:45:05.690
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>they're on our banks mandate.
They have to sign something that says</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7395-3
01:45:05.690 --> 01:45:09.804
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>that the payment can be returned.
So we we get their wet signature</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7395-4
01:45:09.804 --> 01:45:13.796
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>essentially and we send an e-mail off to
our bank and in the UK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7423-0
01:45:13.876 --> 01:45:18.348
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>OK. And that's how it happens there.
Luxembourg is similar to Australia,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7398-0
01:45:15.676 --> 01:45:16.036
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7423-1
01:45:18.348 --> 01:45:21.657
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we have to do something through the
banking platform,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7423-2
01:45:21.657 --> 01:45:26.252
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but certain people have to approve
whatever the cashier team. And so yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7423-3
01:45:26.252 --> 01:45:29.316
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>it's just going to be different pair pair
office.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7450-0
01:45:30.316 --> 01:45:33.288
<v Marwan Altaie>OK,
might be worth reviewing if if we have</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7450-1
01:45:33.288 --> 01:45:37.574
<v Marwan Altaie>those individual processes 'cause I got
the combined process,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7450-2
01:45:37.574 --> 01:45:40.961
<v Marwan Altaie>but if that's not accurate,
that's not an issue,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7450-3
01:45:40.961 --> 01:45:44.556
<v Marwan Altaie>but it would be useful to understand
those nuances.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7451-0
01:45:45.156 --> 01:45:45.316
<v Marwan Altaie>And.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7483-0
01:45:47.116 --> 01:45:52.310
<v Marwan Altaie>This process in particular do we need to
understand those nuances at the end of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7483-1
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:55.036
<v Marwan Altaie>the day,
it's a task and it's going to be</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7483-2
01:45:55.036 --> 01:45:59.841
<v Marwan Altaie>transferred. Australia do it one way,
UK do it another way and there's no</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7483-3
01:45:59.841 --> 01:46:03.996
<v Marwan Altaie>answers for other one.
But we can just call that task transfer.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7521-0
01:46:05.676 --> 01:46:08.194
<v Marwan Altaie>Could do,
but I don't know the extent of the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7521-1
01:46:08.194 --> 01:46:10.881
<v Marwan Altaie>nuances.
I guess there's a question to you guys</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7521-2
01:46:10.881 --> 01:46:14.127
<v Marwan Altaie>how much? Well,
the the the task is going to be cashier's</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7521-3
01:46:14.127 --> 01:46:16.702
<v Marwan Altaie>will e-mail, credit control, credit side.
No,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7521-4
01:46:16.702 --> 01:46:20.452
<v Marwan Altaie>we don't need this funds for whatever
reason needs to be returned.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7521-5
01:46:20.452 --> 01:46:21.796
<v Marwan Altaie>It's Australia and I'll.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7585-0
01:46:22.476 --> 01:46:26.209
<v Marwan Altaie>The team will get the request and send it
back by the ANZ. If it's. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7585-1
01:46:26.209 --> 01:46:28.832
<v Marwan Altaie>you're right.
So it's just a just a task as it goes</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7585-2
01:46:28.832 --> 01:46:31.808
<v Marwan Altaie>from cashiers to credit control and then
back to cashiers.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7585-3
01:46:31.808 --> 01:46:35.541
<v Marwan Altaie>And then the cashiers will get the task.
But however they do that task is</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7585-4
01:46:35.541 --> 01:46:39.475
<v Marwan Altaie>different depending where you are.
The task outside of service now, isn't it?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7585-5
01:46:39.475 --> 01:46:41.796
<v Marwan Altaie>So yeah, OK, fine.
So within the service now.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7596-0
01:46:41.876 --> 01:46:44.793
<v Marwan Altaie>Now the workflow itself is the same,
but it's just how you actually the end</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7596-1
01:46:44.793 --> 01:46:46.636
<v Marwan Altaie>result is different.
You just need to know the.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7599-0
01:46:49.196 --> 01:46:51.756
<v Marwan Altaie>Should to yes, please. Yeah, yeah. OK,
yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7608-0
01:46:54.716 --> 01:46:59.316
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry, Martin.
Did you say you need partners approval?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7643-0
01:46:59.956 --> 01:47:03.596
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah. So in the UK,
we we have the bank asks us to fill out a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7643-1
01:47:03.596 --> 01:47:07.999
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>spreadsheet basically detailing the
payment on the receipt so that it's to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7643-2
01:47:07.999 --> 01:47:12.813
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>get rejected and we need to add, you know,
one or two partners signatures to that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7643-3
01:47:12.813 --> 01:47:14.516
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>sheet depending on the value.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7683-0
01:47:15.756 --> 01:47:19.605
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We've actually got the partners
signatures or we've got like a dozen</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7683-1
01:47:19.605 --> 01:47:22.395
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>partner signatures like an electronic
copy of it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7683-2
01:47:22.395 --> 01:47:26.803
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So what we actually do is we send an
e-mail to the partner and say we're going</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7683-3
01:47:26.803 --> 01:47:29.927
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>to reject these funds.
Are you happy for us to add your</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7683-4
01:47:29.927 --> 01:47:30.876
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>signature to the?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7706-0
01:47:31.396 --> 01:47:34.413
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>To the paperwork,
just help streamline it rather than</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7706-1
01:47:34.413 --> 01:47:37.933
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>having to to E sign it themselves,
they reply back saying yes,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7706-2
01:47:37.933 --> 01:47:42.236
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we add their E signature to the to the
form and then e-mail off to the bank.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7711-0
01:47:43.076 --> 01:47:45.436
<v Marwan Altaie>Is this? Would that stay outside?
ServiceNow yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7756-0
01:47:46.476 --> 01:47:51.124
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>I ideally I would like it to still be in
service now because I could send that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7716-0
01:47:47.236 --> 01:47:47.516
<v Marwan Altaie>It.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7756-1
01:47:51.124 --> 01:47:56.008
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>request that 5:20 tonight and the partner
might not respond till tomorrow morning.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7756-2
01:47:56.008 --> 01:48:00.539
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>But if I'm on holiday or off sick,
I need someone else on my team to be able</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7748-0
01:47:59.756 --> 01:47:59.996
<v Marwan Altaie>Hmm.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7756-3
01:48:00.539 --> 01:48:01.716
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>to pick that up and.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7765-0
01:48:02.236 --> 01:48:04.465
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>If we're doing it through emails like
individual emails,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7765-1
01:48:04.465 --> 01:48:05.756
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>that's where we lose track of it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7769-0
01:48:06.316 --> 01:48:08.156
<v Marwan Altaie>Does that go through show well now,
Martin?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7775-0
01:48:08.076 --> 01:48:10.156
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah, yeah, me too. For this year,
I'll just know.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7808-0
01:48:10.556 --> 01:48:14.814
<v Marwan Altaie>I think the approval process needs to go
through service now in terms of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7808-1
01:48:14.814 --> 01:48:19.364
<v Marwan Altaie>requesting that approval so that it's
captured, but it's also a cashier task,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7808-2
01:48:19.364 --> 01:48:23.389
<v Marwan Altaie>not a credit control task.
So that will need to be picked up through</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7808-3
01:48:23.389 --> 01:48:25.956
<v Marwan Altaie>the cashier pro process that receives
this.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7807-0
01:48:25.476 --> 01:48:25.716
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7879-0
01:48:31.116 --> 01:48:33.560
<v Marwan Altaie>We we still we still want the solution to
be end to end.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7879-1
01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:36.820
<v Marwan Altaie>So even though it's with cashiering,
it does rely on credit control to make</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7879-2
01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:39.436
<v Marwan Altaie>certain decisions.
So I think that's something we'll have to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7879-3
01:48:39.436 --> 01:48:41.709
<v Marwan Altaie>account for.
We we can go through as as a use case I</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7879-4
01:48:41.709 --> 01:48:45.140
<v Marwan Altaie>think we'll need to take a consistent
approach to that on everything that we're</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7879-5
01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:48.443
<v Marwan Altaie>looking at here because this is exactly
what's going to happen all the time.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7879-6
01:48:48.443 --> 01:48:50.116
<v Marwan Altaie>Credit control will just do one bit of.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7899-0
01:48:50.276 --> 01:48:52.655
<v Marwan Altaie>Of it,
then it will come back to cashiers and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7899-1
01:48:52.655 --> 01:48:56.276
<v Marwan Altaie>then their process will differ.
But that's probably captured in their</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7899-2
01:48:56.276 --> 01:48:59.276
<v Marwan Altaie>process of how that differs.
It's just how we join it up.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7900-0
01:49:04.716 --> 01:49:05.076
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7901-0
01:49:09.716 --> 01:49:10.116
<v Marwan Altaie>So.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7902-0
01:49:11.716 --> 01:49:11.836
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7914-0
01:49:13.556 --> 01:49:16.965
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool.
And so that was purely on the rejection</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7914-1
01:49:16.965 --> 01:49:18.596
<v Marwan Altaie>side, is that correct?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7916-0
01:49:19.556 --> 01:49:20.156
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yes.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7943-0
01:49:22.636 --> 01:49:26.396
<v Marwan Altaie>Taking an action,
we'll follow up and see how the end to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7943-1
01:49:26.396 --> 01:49:31.344
<v Marwan Altaie>end process and I'm sure a lot of you
will be involved in that discussion.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7943-2
01:49:31.344 --> 01:49:35.236
<v Marwan Altaie>The return side refund side is this where
we need to have.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7948-0
01:49:36.316 --> 01:49:38.556
<v Marwan Altaie>Approvals because we're sending out money
pretty much.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7963-0
01:49:40.996 --> 01:49:44.772
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah, we would need,
I think a key on late if we were doing a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7963-1
01:49:44.772 --> 01:49:47.635
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>refund,
the money would always be moved to the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/7963-2
01:49:47.635 --> 01:49:49.036
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>client account 1st and.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8000-0
01:49:50.476 --> 01:49:54.020
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>No matter why we're sending money out of
the client account,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8000-1
01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:58.319
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we always need partner approval,
so this essentially falls back into what</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8000-2
01:49:58.319 --> 01:50:01.689
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we spoke about in Wednesday when we had a
client payment.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8000-3
01:50:01.689 --> 01:50:06.396
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>This refund now becomes a client payment
and we follow that same Mark stream as.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8030-0
01:50:07.236 --> 01:50:10.414
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>As we spoke about in Wednesday,
so rather than a lawyer sending us a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8030-1
01:50:10.414 --> 01:50:13.040
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>payment form and asking us to to do the
payment request,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8030-2
01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:15.943
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>the payment forms actually coming from
credit control instead.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8030-3
01:50:15.943 --> 01:50:19.076
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>And then we still follow that same all
the same actions afterwards.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8059-0
01:50:20.836 --> 01:50:23.019
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.
Do we wanna keep transferred to client</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8033-0
01:50:21.196 --> 01:50:21.316
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8059-1
01:50:23.019 --> 01:50:26.980
<v Marwan Altaie>accounts and refund separate or is it
just refund because it always goes into</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8059-2
01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:29.722
<v Marwan Altaie>client accounts?
Is there a reason we'd wanna in this</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8059-3
01:50:29.722 --> 01:50:31.956
<v Marwan Altaie>scenario to host it in the client
accounts?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8098-0
01:50:32.876 --> 01:50:37.184
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So for UK I think it just falls into the
IT doesn't have to sit in this section,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8098-1
01:50:37.184 --> 01:50:41.280
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>it just goes back into client account
payment which is for Australia because</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8098-2
01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:45.164
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>they can be doing refunds from client
trust account or from the suspense</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8098-3
01:50:45.164 --> 01:50:47.717
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>account.
Maybe I don't know where you wanted to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8098-4
01:50:47.717 --> 01:50:48.196
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>sit Anna.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8139-0
01:50:48.996 --> 01:50:52.293
<v Marwan Altaie>We generally if we're doing any client
refunds,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8139-1
01:50:52.293 --> 01:50:56.277
<v Marwan Altaie>we generally prefer to do that out of the
office account.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8139-2
01:50:56.277 --> 01:50:59.436
<v Marwan Altaie>So then that falls into the suspense
process.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8139-3
01:50:59.436 --> 01:51:04.451
<v Marwan Altaie>If we're moving money from suspense to
trust, it would be for a purpose,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8139-4
01:51:04.451 --> 01:51:05.756
<v Marwan Altaie>so it would be for.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8169-0
01:51:06.276 --> 01:51:10.078
<v Marwan Altaie>Payment of an invoice more likely than
actually refund it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8169-1
01:51:10.078 --> 01:51:14.976
<v Marwan Altaie>Refunding it back to the client because
the client would have to go through</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8169-2
01:51:14.976 --> 01:51:20.131
<v Marwan Altaie>additional admin steps just to get that
money the same way that we'd be able to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8169-3
01:51:20.131 --> 01:51:22.516
<v Marwan Altaie>do it in less less steps from office.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8209-0
01:51:24.676 --> 01:51:27.538
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.
So it's an additional step essentially</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8209-1
01:51:27.538 --> 01:51:33.063
<v Marwan Altaie>because you have two places to store it,
whereas the UK just has one of the output</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8209-2
01:51:33.063 --> 01:51:36.258
<v Marwan Altaie>and the factors for the most part are the
same.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8209-3
01:51:36.258 --> 01:51:40.585
<v Marwan Altaie>I would I would just leave Australia's
office rather than trust.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8209-4
01:51:40.585 --> 01:51:42.316
<v Marwan Altaie>So same process as the UK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8221-0
01:51:42.476 --> 01:51:46.946
<v Marwan Altaie>We just give in office.
It just would follow the suspense</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8221-1
01:51:46.946 --> 01:51:48.796
<v Marwan Altaie>decision process though.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8255-0
01:51:54.836 --> 01:51:57.972
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool.
This feels like another one that's</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8255-1
01:51:57.972 --> 01:52:03.174
<v Marwan Altaie>slightly easier to do in terms of
rejections, and then the refunds.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8255-2
01:52:03.174 --> 01:52:08.987
<v Marwan Altaie>Seems like it sits again within your
suspense for the Australia side. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8255-3
01:52:08.987 --> 01:52:09.676
<v Marwan Altaie>yeah, OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8299-0
01:52:10.516 --> 01:52:15.418
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm relatively happy to say relatively
because I know there's a lot of nuances,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8299-1
01:52:15.418 --> 01:52:20.319
<v Marwan Altaie>so I'm sure when I start reviewing these
notes it will be a bunch of questions,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8299-2
01:52:20.319 --> 01:52:23.444
<v Marwan Altaie>but for now I'm happy with how that flow
is going.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8299-3
01:52:23.444 --> 01:52:28.163
<v Marwan Altaie>Just going back to the partner approvals
for the rejection you said we had a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8299-4
01:52:28.163 --> 01:52:29.756
<v Marwan Altaie>spreadsheet at the moment.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8324-0
01:52:29.796 --> 01:52:32.486
<v Marwan Altaie>Moment where we're getting partners
signatures.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8324-1
01:52:32.486 --> 01:52:36.017
<v Marwan Altaie>Are we saying also want to potentially
digitise that document,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8304-0
01:52:32.836 --> 01:52:33.076
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8324-2
01:52:36.017 --> 01:52:38.596
<v Marwan Altaie>put it into service now or it could set
that?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8341-0
01:52:36.836 --> 01:52:39.138
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>No,
it's it has to be the spreadsheet because</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8341-1
01:52:39.138 --> 01:52:42.843
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>it's a bank that requests us to fill that
spreadsheet out. So it's not a,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8341-2
01:52:42.843 --> 01:52:45.396
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>it's not an internal process,
it's a bank process.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8336-0
01:52:43.156 --> 01:52:43.436
<v Marwan Altaie>Fine.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8359-0
01:52:46.076 --> 01:52:47.532
<v Marwan Altaie>Fine,
and I'm assuming it has to be in that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8359-1
01:52:47.532 --> 01:52:49.187
<v Marwan Altaie>format 'cause they uploaded into their
documents.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8359-2
01:52:49.187 --> 01:52:50.876
<v Marwan Altaie>That's why they've given to you in that
structure.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8373-0
01:52:50.276 --> 01:52:52.487
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.
So we we used to do it in a different way</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8373-1
01:52:52.487 --> 01:52:56.219
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>and they come back a couple of years ago
and says all requests must come in this</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8373-2
01:52:56.219 --> 01:52:56.956
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>format. So yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8390-0
01:52:58.556 --> 01:53:01.830
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it worth 'cause I?
I know there's excel export functions in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8390-1
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:04.636
<v Marwan Altaie>uh ServiceNow,
is that something we could potentially</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8390-2
01:53:04.636 --> 01:53:05.156
<v Marwan Altaie>look into?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8398-0
01:53:06.436 --> 01:53:08.636
<v Marwan Altaie>If we have the same columns or is it not
worth the work?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8425-0
01:53:11.756 --> 01:53:16.208
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>There's no no harm I'm looking into,
I suppose, but it's just a it's very,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8406-0
01:53:14.756 --> 01:53:14.956
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8425-1
01:53:16.208 --> 01:53:19.354
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>very basic.
Just basically spreadsheet says date the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8425-2
01:53:19.354 --> 01:53:22.678
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>funds arrived.
What bank account did arrive into amount</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8425-3
01:53:22.678 --> 01:53:26.596
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>and to did it come from?
That's fairly straightforward and basic.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8449-0
01:53:27.836 --> 01:53:32.017
<v Marwan Altaie>For the sake of centralization,
how often do the banks make requests to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8449-1
01:53:32.017 --> 01:53:35.676
<v Marwan Altaie>change the columns or the data structure
or any of that stuff?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8462-0
01:53:35.236 --> 01:53:39.406
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>It's been the same spreadsheet for a
number of years now. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8462-1
01:53:39.406 --> 01:53:41.036
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>they've never changed it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8495-0
01:53:40.596 --> 01:53:42.346
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.
Would it be possible to send us across</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8495-1
01:53:42.346 --> 01:53:44.706
<v Marwan Altaie>that structure?
It's it's not something we'll necessarily</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8495-2
01:53:44.706 --> 01:53:47.066
<v Marwan Altaie>do in phase one,
but just for the sake of centralization,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8495-3
01:53:47.066 --> 01:53:49.956
<v Marwan Altaie>it might be worth having it in there
instead of where it closes. It's.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8491-0
01:53:48.756 --> 01:53:48.996
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8493-0
01:53:50.036 --> 01:53:50.516
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Nobody's.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8516-0
01:53:51.716 --> 01:53:56.667
<v Marwan Altaie>Thank you. OK.
We'll move on for now and everyone's</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8516-1
01:53:56.667 --> 01:54:00.951
<v Marwan Altaie>favourite part,
what data should we capture?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8516-2
01:54:00.951 --> 01:54:05.236
<v Marwan Altaie>I'll separate it into rejecting and
refunds.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8540-0
01:54:08.836 --> 01:54:14.138
<v Marwan Altaie>So assuming again request type,
we're going to need region entity,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8540-1
01:54:14.138 --> 01:54:20.231
<v Marwan Altaie>is that safe to remove if the actors are
going to be the same and we're just</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8540-2
01:54:20.231 --> 01:54:23.476
<v Marwan Altaie>rooting it to different groups just type?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8548-0
01:54:29.076 --> 01:54:31.156
<v Marwan Altaie>Submitted that we do need. Sorry go.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8588-0
01:54:29.156 --> 01:54:31.213
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So.
So the way this the way this was</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8588-1
01:54:31.213 --> 01:54:35.439
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>triggered is we would just fill in the
same unallocated forums we discussed</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8588-2
01:54:35.439 --> 01:54:38.831
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>prior to the break.
Then it's just credit control from banks</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8569-0
01:54:38.516 --> 01:54:39.116
<v Marwan Altaie>Mm-hmm.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8588-3
01:54:38.831 --> 01:54:42.723
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>and reject. So we wouldn't,
it would just be the same fields as we've</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8575-0
01:54:41.196 --> 01:54:41.396
<v Marwan Altaie>Yep.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8588-4
01:54:42.723 --> 01:54:44.836
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>already discussed previously and then.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8586-0
01:54:45.356 --> 01:54:45.596
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8593-0
01:54:45.396 --> 01:54:47.876
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>The action is to reject.
There's nothing more required.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8598-0
01:54:48.836 --> 01:54:50.809
<v Marwan Altaie>No,
it's a fairpoint because there's a sub</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8598-1
01:54:50.809 --> 01:54:51.636
<v Marwan Altaie>process, isn't it?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8599-0
01:54:52.156 --> 01:54:52.356
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8602-0
01:54:53.116 --> 01:54:53.516
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, cool.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8624-0
01:55:05.116 --> 01:55:09.440
<v Marwan Altaie>Thank you. Let's move on.
Managing funds and clients account.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8624-1
01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:13.556
<v Marwan Altaie>Is this something that we want in scope
of credit control?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8639-0
01:55:16.076 --> 01:55:22.298
<v Marwan Altaie>The scenario I was provided was that
credit control handle client account on</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8639-1
01:55:22.298 --> 01:55:24.076
<v Marwan Altaie>account of fees funds.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8690-0
01:55:26.316 --> 01:55:29.894
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>There's different things with credit
control can look after the client</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8642-0
01:55:26.516 --> 01:55:26.756
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8690-1
01:55:29.894 --> 01:55:32.515
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>accounts,
so I don't know what this map relates to,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8690-2
01:55:32.515 --> 01:55:36.647
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but if the credit control team tells us
to move some funds to the client account,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8690-3
01:55:36.647 --> 01:55:40.276
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>it's kind of their responsibility to then
get those funds cleared down.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8676-0
01:55:37.556 --> 01:55:37.676
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8723-0
01:55:40.676 --> 01:55:45.176
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Whether that's a refund or getting
permission to use the the funds against</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8723-1
01:55:45.176 --> 01:55:49.976
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>other outstanding invoices. But Stephen,
you may be best to talk about the next</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8723-2
01:55:49.976 --> 01:55:52.196
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>bit,
there's some money that sits in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8723-3
01:55:52.196 --> 01:55:56.996
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>unintended just called on accounting fees,
which could be money that's arrived.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8747-0
01:55:57.276 --> 01:56:01.555
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Directly into our client account and it's
for future fees and I don't know if</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8747-1
01:56:01.555 --> 01:56:05.889
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>credit control does anything to to kind
of report on that so that they can try</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8747-2
01:56:05.889 --> 01:56:09.236
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>and get funds in the client account
offset against invoices.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8750-0
01:56:11.516 --> 01:56:15.636
<v Marwan Altaie>Can we do sorry.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8751-0
01:56:17.356 --> 01:56:17.436
<v Marwan Altaie>See.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8801-0
01:56:19.276 --> 01:56:21.905
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.
So what we will generally do with those</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8801-1
01:56:21.905 --> 01:56:26.306
<v Marwan Altaie>is communicate with a partner to advise
that we are holding funds within the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8801-2
01:56:26.306 --> 01:56:30.193
<v Marwan Altaie>client account already and this should be
noted on future invoices.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8801-3
01:56:30.193 --> 01:56:34.309
<v Marwan Altaie>What we'll do in the instance that
Martin's talking about as well is if</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8801-4
01:56:34.309 --> 01:56:38.596
<v Marwan Altaie>there's funds that we don't have any
further instruction on, we'll, we'll.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8836-0
01:56:38.636 --> 01:56:41.079
<v Marwan Altaie>We'll then revert back to the partner as
well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8836-1
01:56:41.079 --> 01:56:43.366
<v Marwan Altaie>You know how those funds should be
managed,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8836-2
01:56:43.366 --> 01:56:46.642
<v Marwan Altaie>but that's generally after we've
communicated with the client.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8836-3
01:56:46.642 --> 01:56:50.904
<v Marwan Altaie>So say we've received a duplicate payment
or we've received a payment where we've</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8836-4
01:56:50.904 --> 01:56:53.556
<v Marwan Altaie>got a matter name,
but we don't have an exact sum.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8877-0
01:56:53.836 --> 01:56:56.878
<v Marwan Altaie>And we're not able to allocate it
accurately to, you know,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8877-1
01:56:56.878 --> 01:56:59.971
<v Marwan Altaie>a list of invoices.
What we'll then do is if we don't get a</v>

01:56:59.971 --> 01:57:03.425
<v Marwan Altaie>response from the client,
is ask the partner to reach out to their</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8877-3
01:57:03.425 --> 01:57:06.725
<v Marwan Altaie>partner at the client.
Do you want the funds held on account so</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8877-4
01:57:06.725 --> 01:57:09.252
<v Marwan Altaie>that they can be worked down of future
invoices?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8877-5
01:57:09.252 --> 01:57:12.036
<v Marwan Altaie>Or should these funds be returned back to
the client?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8878-0
01:57:13.556 --> 01:57:13.756
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8889-0
01:57:15.916 --> 01:57:20.036
<v Marwan Altaie>Seems like a relatively basic workflow to
be able to include.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8890-0
01:57:21.796 --> 01:57:22.036
<v Marwan Altaie>Umm.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8925-0
01:57:24.636 --> 01:57:28.021
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it always a case of or?
I guess region variance,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8925-1
01:57:28.021 --> 01:57:32.969
<v Marwan Altaie>which we'll probably be able to come back
on? I'm not sure. I'm sure it is.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8925-2
01:57:32.969 --> 01:57:37.266
<v Marwan Altaie>How often do we account?
I'm just trying to think in terms of the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8925-3
01:57:37.266 --> 01:57:40.196
<v Marwan Altaie>credit control solution.
Is it worth having?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8945-0
01:57:40.676 --> 01:57:44.747
<v Marwan Altaie>As a separate process and form and
submissions through doesn't need to sit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8945-1
01:57:44.747 --> 01:57:47.570
<v Marwan Altaie>within here.
Or is this just a process that happens</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8945-2
01:57:47.570 --> 01:57:49.036
<v Marwan Altaie>and you get your approvals?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8954-0
01:57:51.436 --> 01:57:57.356
<v Marwan Altaie>It's not something that happens regularly,
but it's.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8995-0
01:57:59.636 --> 01:58:02.990
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean, it's a couple of emails, you know,
one to the client,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8995-1
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:07.157
<v Marwan Altaie>one to the partner and one to cashiers
and that that closes off the process.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8995-2
01:58:07.157 --> 01:58:11.486
<v Marwan Altaie>So in its entirety on sums that were not
able to resolve at the time the credit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/8995-3
01:58:11.486 --> 01:58:14.516
<v Marwan Altaie>control team look after the,
you know the trust report.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9035-0
01:58:14.996 --> 01:58:18.090
<v Marwan Altaie>And we review that so throughout the
month and we'll, you know,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9035-1
01:58:18.090 --> 01:58:21.667
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll refer back to the the partner or
the client for updates if we don't</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9035-2
01:58:21.667 --> 01:58:24.761
<v Marwan Altaie>receive them, you know,
at at the point of receiving the funds.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9035-3
01:58:24.761 --> 01:58:27.323
<v Marwan Altaie>OK. So is this for the most part,
just confirmation.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9035-4
01:58:27.323 --> 01:58:30.756
<v Marwan Altaie>And then once your approval has gone and
you action it, that's it. So.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9053-0
01:58:31.956 --> 01:58:34.695
<v Marwan Altaie>In most cases,
we're able to resolve it at, you know,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9053-1
01:58:34.695 --> 01:58:37.942
<v Marwan Altaie>at at the time. You know,
we look at it either through feedback</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9053-2
01:58:37.942 --> 01:58:40.276
<v Marwan Altaie>from the client or feedback from the
partner.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9067-0
01:58:42.156 --> 01:58:44.812
<v Marwan Altaie>Just to the whole group,
is it worth accounting for this one</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9067-1
01:58:44.812 --> 01:58:47.076
<v Marwan Altaie>considering you already have quite an
easy process?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9101-0
01:58:50.876 --> 01:58:53.863
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Well,
I think Stephen was when we get asked to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9101-1
01:58:53.863 --> 01:58:58.059
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>do an office to client,
I just say you you tend to deal with them</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9101-2
01:58:58.059 --> 01:59:01.618
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>then and then.
But there are some that slip through the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9101-3
01:59:01.618 --> 01:59:06.894
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>net more like the examples I'm more sees
when I'm doing a essential balance report</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9101-4
01:59:06.894 --> 01:59:07.276
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>maybe.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9142-0
01:59:08.596 --> 01:59:10.934
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>I've got one.
I've got an example just now of we get</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9142-1
01:59:10.934 --> 01:59:14.374
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>asked to move money to the client account
in February and I've reached out to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9142-2
01:59:14.374 --> 01:59:16.492
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>someone on the team,
can't remember who it was,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9142-3
01:59:16.492 --> 01:59:19.977
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but I don't think they were aware that
the funds went to the client account in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9142-4
01:59:19.977 --> 01:59:22.756
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>February because they were on holiday
that day and someone is.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9187-0
01:59:23.316 --> 01:59:27.389
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Told us to park the funds to client
account until that person returns from</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9187-1
01:59:27.389 --> 01:59:30.104
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>holiday,
but maybe it wasn't communicated back to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9187-2
01:59:30.104 --> 01:59:33.145
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>that person,
so we ended up eight months down the line.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9187-3
01:59:33.145 --> 01:59:36.186
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We hadn't even contacted the client or
the partner yet,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9187-4
01:59:36.186 --> 01:59:38.956
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>which obviously isn't ideal,
but I'm wondering if.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9213-0
01:59:39.556 --> 01:59:44.036
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>When we've got the office to client,
part of the process figured out if that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9213-1
01:59:44.036 --> 01:59:47.119
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>remains open,
that the credit control site until the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9213-2
01:59:47.119 --> 01:59:50.436
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>funds are cleared down from the client
account may help.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9224-0
01:59:53.196 --> 01:59:57.916
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Everybody to be able to identify what's
still still to be cleared cleared off.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9225-0
02:00:00.436 --> 02:00:01.956
<v Marwan Altaie>But if you want.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9228-0
02:00:11.036 --> 02:00:11.596
<v Marwan Altaie>So do you.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9232-0
02:00:16.676 --> 02:00:17.636
<v Marwan Altaie>Oslis around them.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9268-0
02:00:20.116 --> 02:00:23.896
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that the best approach?
I'm trying to think of again cost benefit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9268-1
02:00:23.896 --> 02:00:27.073
<v Marwan Altaie>if we include it.
Are you adding extra admin but securing</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9268-2
02:00:27.073 --> 02:00:30.908
<v Marwan Altaie>that workflow? Alternatively,
are people going to follow this knowing</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9268-3
02:00:30.908 --> 02:00:35.182
<v Marwan Altaie>that they can just send an e-mail and get
an answer and resolution within 2-3</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9268-4
02:00:35.182 --> 02:00:36.716
<v Marwan Altaie>minutes or two three emails?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9279-0
02:00:40.876 --> 02:00:44.987
<v Marwan Altaie>How do you manage those ones that are
rooting for unbelievable amounts of time</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9279-1
02:00:44.987 --> 02:00:45.716
<v Marwan Altaie>at the moment?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9292-0
02:00:47.756 --> 02:00:50.048
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>He's talking to me.
I couldn't hear who was speaking in the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9292-1
02:00:50.048 --> 02:00:51.996
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>room prior to that,
so I'm not sure what was said.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9291-0
02:00:51.156 --> 02:00:51.316
<v Marwan Altaie>Mark.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9293-0
02:00:55.036 --> 02:00:55.156
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9295-0
02:00:59.916 --> 02:01:00.276
<v Marwan Altaie>Thank you.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9328-0
02:01:03.116 --> 02:01:07.757
<v Marwan Altaie>Just saying the you potentially have
amounts set on trust for a very long time,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9328-1
02:01:07.757 --> 02:01:12.283
<v Marwan Altaie>and if you're going to assign a task to
that amount or ticket to that amount,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9328-2
02:01:12.283 --> 02:01:15.242
<v Marwan Altaie>it could well stay open for a long period
of time.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9328-3
02:01:15.242 --> 02:01:18.956
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we want to have tickets open for a
very long period of time?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9343-0
02:01:20.596 --> 02:01:23.799
<v Marwan Altaie>They also don't necessarily get assigned
to one person.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9343-1
02:01:23.799 --> 02:01:25.516
<v Marwan Altaie>It may relate to someone else.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9383-0
02:01:25.956 --> 02:01:29.384
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>I think I would like it to be similar to
what you're doing for the suspense</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9383-1
02:01:29.384 --> 02:01:32.902
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>account at the end of the day the money
is getting moved to get cleared down,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9383-2
02:01:32.902 --> 02:01:36.059
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but there should maybe be a way to close
the ticket off. For example,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9383-3
02:01:36.059 --> 02:01:39.578
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>if it's going to sit there for a long
time and we know that it's going to sit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9383-4
02:01:39.578 --> 02:01:40.796
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>there for a long time then.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9427-0
02:01:41.276 --> 02:01:44.207
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>The ticket can be closed off with the for
comment saying.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9427-1
02:01:44.207 --> 02:01:47.695
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>This is why we're closing off,
even though the money is still there.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9427-2
02:01:47.695 --> 02:01:51.738
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>But I think it would help capture the
ones that do slip through the net because</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9427-3
02:01:51.738 --> 02:01:55.579
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we we have just agreed we're just
agreeing with our auditors right now that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9427-4
02:01:55.579 --> 02:01:59.522
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>any of these balances that have been
moved have to be cleared down within six</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9427-5
02:01:59.522 --> 02:01:59.876
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>months.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9460-0
02:02:00.516 --> 02:02:04.902
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We have to record that as a breach of SRA
rules, so the example I just gave there,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9460-1
02:02:04.902 --> 02:02:08.813
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>it never appeared to never residual
balance report for until eight months</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9460-2
02:02:08.813 --> 02:02:11.296
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>later,
so instantly we've breached and we have</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9460-3
02:02:11.296 --> 02:02:14.996
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>to record that as a breach because we're
already two months over the.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9483-0
02:02:15.516 --> 02:02:18.776
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>The agreed timeline.
So I think when we're talking about</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9483-1
02:02:18.776 --> 02:02:23.009
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>breaches and maybe ways that can help
stop those breaches from happening,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9483-2
02:02:23.009 --> 02:02:26.384
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>it's definitely,
definitely worth kind of looking into and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9483-3
02:02:26.384 --> 02:02:26.956
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>exploring.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9496-0
02:02:29.156 --> 02:02:31.610
<v Marwan Altaie>So my question was,
how do you manage ones that are sitting</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9496-1
02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:32.756
<v Marwan Altaie>open for ages at the moment?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9529-0
02:02:33.076 --> 02:02:36.904
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We don't really have a way to do it.
So Stephen was talking about there's a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9529-1
02:02:36.904 --> 02:02:40.884
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>there's a trust spreadsheet that the the
team looks at and they'll it's it's a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9529-2
02:02:40.884 --> 02:02:44.309
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>report that gives them all balances that
are on the client account,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9529-3
02:02:44.309 --> 02:02:47.836
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but it doesn't tell you really how long
the balance is sat there for.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9588-0
02:02:48.876 --> 02:02:51.260
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>My dad's job balance report can pick
stuff up,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9588-1
02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:55.217
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but the way the report works is it only
looks at matters that haven't had any</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9588-2
02:02:55.217 --> 02:02:59.073
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>work recorded for three months. So again,
that example I used everyone from</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9588-3
02:02:59.073 --> 02:03:01.660
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>February.
There had been work getting recorded all</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9588-4
02:03:01.660 --> 02:03:05.008
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>the way up to about July time,
and then when we run the report in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9588-5
02:03:05.008 --> 02:03:07.596
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>October,
because there've been no work since July.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9622-0
02:03:07.996 --> 02:03:10.698
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>That's when it first appeared on that
ever report.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9622-1
02:03:10.698 --> 02:03:13.453
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So we're already a bit too late to to
deal with it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9622-2
02:03:13.453 --> 02:03:16.738
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>so there's there's there is ways that we
are dealing with it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9622-3
02:03:16.738 --> 02:03:20.818
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but I think this would be an extra way
that could help and make sure that we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9622-4
02:03:20.818 --> 02:03:22.196
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>were not missing anything.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9631-0
02:03:23.036 --> 02:03:26.663
<v Marwan Altaie>On the trust report that you run,
how come do we know why it wasn't picked</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9631-1
02:03:26.663 --> 02:03:28.356
<v Marwan Altaie>up from trust report? You were one.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9668-0
02:03:29.996 --> 02:03:34.226
<v Marwan Altaie>Don't know if we'll come back to.
Maybe that's all. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9668-1
02:03:34.226 --> 02:03:38.528
<v Marwan Altaie>So is there a way that we could put this
into service now,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9668-2
02:03:38.528 --> 02:03:44.071
<v Marwan Altaie>we might have instances where tickets
would settle for indefinite amount of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9668-3
02:03:44.071 --> 02:03:44.436
<v Marwan Altaie>time.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9704-0
02:03:45.356 --> 02:03:49.902
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm sure we talked about this for
examples last week and some of the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9704-1
02:03:49.902 --> 02:03:54.447
<v Marwan Altaie>processes where we can move them into a
separate queue, if you like,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9704-2
02:03:54.447 --> 02:03:59.389
<v Marwan Altaie>in a dashboard where they sit and
actually that gives you a source to then</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9704-3
02:03:59.389 --> 02:04:01.036
<v Marwan Altaie>check on a regular basis.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9719-0
02:04:02.636 --> 02:04:07.921
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm sorry. It's coming up to six months.
You get a notification to go in and check</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9719-1
02:04:07.921 --> 02:04:08.876
<v Marwan Altaie>that dashboard.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9766-0
02:04:11.436 --> 02:04:14.569
<v Marwan Altaie>Serious our UK process on the money?
The one? Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9766-1
02:04:14.569 --> 02:04:18.244
<v Marwan Altaie>I think I probably agree with Martin,
to be honest with you,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9766-2
02:04:18.244 --> 02:04:23.064
<v Marwan Altaie>if those are if there's annoying breach
dating back to February that we weren't</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9766-3
02:04:23.064 --> 02:04:26.679
<v Marwan Altaie>aware of then yeah.
If there's something else we can put in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9766-4
02:04:26.679 --> 02:04:30.716
<v Marwan Altaie>place to prevent that happening again,
yeah, that would basically.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9811-0
02:04:30.876 --> 02:04:35.388
<v Marwan Altaie>So we want really basically as a list,
isn't it to be able to see that's come in,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9811-1
02:04:35.388 --> 02:04:39.570
<v Marwan Altaie>we've not been able to manage that.
We don't have any other instructions or</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9811-2
02:04:39.570 --> 02:04:42.156
<v Marwan Altaie>anything else that we can check at the
moment.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9811-3
02:04:42.156 --> 02:04:46.284
<v Marwan Altaie>It can sit there like it's put a rule in
in three months time to check it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9811-4
02:04:46.284 --> 02:04:49.750
<v Marwan Altaie>somebody pick up. Yeah.
And if that SRA rule for six months is</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9811-5
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:50.356
<v Marwan Altaie>there mark.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9832-0
02:04:50.476 --> 02:04:53.992
<v Marwan Altaie>And then you can check it two or three
times before that six months,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9859-0
02:04:53.196 --> 02:04:56.304
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I think it's important what you say</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9832-1
02:04:53.992 --> 02:04:57.356
<v Marwan Altaie>the system can prompt you to do that. Yep,
I agree with that. OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9859-1
02:04:56.304 --> 02:04:59.305
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>that Joe was.
It's almost like it needs to be hidden in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9859-2
02:04:59.305 --> 02:05:02.252
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>the background,
so it doesn't just clog up in people's</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9859-3
02:05:02.252 --> 02:05:04.396
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>dashboards and stuff like that. So yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9887-0
02:05:02.716 --> 02:05:05.514
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, you don't want it set. Yeah. So see,
for example,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9887-1
02:05:05.514 --> 02:05:09.411
<v Marwan Altaie>when we were doing the people stuff,
there's loads of ones that will set open</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9887-2
02:05:09.411 --> 02:05:12.559
<v Marwan Altaie>for months and months because it's not a
one and done process.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9875-0
02:05:12.276 --> 02:05:12.396
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9887-3
02:05:12.559 --> 02:05:16.607
<v Marwan Altaie>They will just have a separate dashboard
that they can actually go in and have a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9887-4
02:05:16.607 --> 02:05:18.156
<v Marwan Altaie>look at them and chase them up.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9889-0
02:05:19.356 --> 02:05:19.596
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9926-0
02:05:22.076 --> 02:05:25.876
<v Marwan Altaie>So we're saying very basic tracker just
to raise when these scenarios do come in,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9926-1
02:05:25.876 --> 02:05:28.797
<v Marwan Altaie>have it somewhere segregated from the
rest of these processes.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9926-2
02:05:28.797 --> 02:05:32.273
<v Marwan Altaie>But it's just there for reference and
potentially some basic Slas or basic</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9926-3
02:05:32.273 --> 02:05:35.796
<v Marwan Altaie>timing elements saying this has been
there for six months, what's going on?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9957-0
02:05:45.556 --> 02:05:48.932
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we want that for this particular one?
I'm thinking for their reporting.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9957-1
02:05:48.932 --> 02:05:52.219
<v Marwan Altaie>If we have it with the other items,
then you'll just have a bulk load of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9957-2
02:05:52.219 --> 02:05:54.334
<v Marwan Altaie>items,
but I'm assuming this one they probably</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9957-3
02:05:54.334 --> 02:05:57.036
<v Marwan Altaie>want to have specific reporting on funds
in client account.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9985-0
02:05:58.916 --> 02:06:01.952
<v Marwan Altaie>The the report of funds from client
account would come for three anyway,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9985-1
02:06:01.952 --> 02:06:03.823
<v Marwan Altaie>so we do not want something in service.
Now.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9985-2
02:06:03.823 --> 02:06:07.192
<v Marwan Altaie>We could easily identify these are your.
Actually we could philtre that through,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9985-3
02:06:07.192 --> 02:06:10.436
<v Marwan Altaie>couldn't we? For these specific scenarios.
So yeah, it would work as a state.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/9990-0
02:06:13.516 --> 02:06:15.356
<v Marwan Altaie>Oh super dashboard.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10022-0
02:06:31.316 --> 02:06:34.041
<v Marwan Altaie>Yep, just to confirm,
I'm I'm sure you've already said what the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10022-1
02:06:34.041 --> 02:06:36.256
<v Marwan Altaie>process is,
but is it pretty much credit controller</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10022-2
02:06:36.256 --> 02:06:39.748
<v Marwan Altaie>speaks to the partner and then either the
credit controller or the partner chases</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10022-3
02:06:39.748 --> 02:06:42.134
<v Marwan Altaie>for some form of instruction.
And if they don't get it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10022-4
02:06:42.134 --> 02:06:43.156
<v Marwan Altaie>then it just sits there.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10027-0
02:06:44.676 --> 02:06:47.916
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, cool. That's very simple.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10034-0
02:06:49.796 --> 02:06:51.556
<v Marwan Altaie>We didn't speak about Australia side,
did we?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10051-0
02:06:53.836 --> 02:06:58.225
<v Marwan Altaie>Not not applicable in Australia,
credit control don't have anything to do</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10051-1
02:06:58.225 --> 02:07:02.556
<v Marwan Altaie>with managing trust monies in Australia
it's all managed by the farmers.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10060-0
02:07:05.316 --> 02:07:09.596
<v Marwan Altaie>One of the upsides managing funds and
clients.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10067-0
02:07:11.556 --> 02:07:14.756
<v Marwan Altaie>I think I can probably introduce what we
need.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10079-0
02:07:17.076 --> 02:07:21.757
<v Marwan Altaie>Just making notes for myself.
Is there anything outside of these items</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10079-1
02:07:21.757 --> 02:07:23.076
<v Marwan Altaie>that is a mandatory?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10085-0
02:07:31.676 --> 02:07:33.716
<v Marwan Altaie>I think of Steven Martin, I guess this.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10103-0
02:07:38.156 --> 02:07:40.533
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Don't have it off the screen and I've
come back.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10103-1
02:07:40.533 --> 02:07:44.268
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>The screen's not loaded up so I can't see
if it's been shared just like, oh,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10103-2
02:07:44.268 --> 02:07:44.996
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>never go sorry.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10110-0
02:07:57.036 --> 02:07:59.276
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So what is this table going to be used
for? Sorry.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10147-0
02:08:00.276 --> 02:08:03.513
<v Marwan Altaie>So this is to drive the service now data
capture.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10147-1
02:08:03.513 --> 02:08:07.980
<v Marwan Altaie>So if we're going into some form of form
submission or request type,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10147-2
02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:13.029
<v Marwan Altaie>what data coming in would help drive
these processes and not require back and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10147-3
02:08:13.029 --> 02:08:16.396
<v Marwan Altaie>forths or emails or teams calls that kind
of stuff.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10156-0
02:08:17.076 --> 02:08:20.616
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah, but to to do what?
We'll just say my managing funds,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10156-1
02:08:20.616 --> 02:08:21.516
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but it's those.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10198-0
02:08:22.756 --> 02:08:26.686
<v Marwan Altaie>So this one is just for,
so it probably isn't clear, is it?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10198-1
02:08:26.686 --> 02:08:31.403
<v Marwan Altaie>This is for an item that's been raised
and it's flagging in the system,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10198-2
02:08:31.403 --> 02:08:35.661
<v Marwan Altaie>and we need to allocate,
so a decision hasn't actually been made</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10198-3
02:08:35.661 --> 02:08:40.116
<v Marwan Altaie>on it at this point or the end output is.
You want a decision made.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10235-0
02:08:40.476 --> 02:08:44.691
<v Marwan Altaie>But what we discussed was there'll be a
potentially a state for this ticket where</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10235-1
02:08:44.691 --> 02:08:48.546
<v Marwan Altaie>if it hasn't reached that decision,
we can segregate it and then put it in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10235-2
02:08:48.546 --> 02:08:51.476
<v Marwan Altaie>like a backlog area.
So ultimately you want to have some</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10245-0
02:08:50.076 --> 02:08:54.448
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah. OK. So the money is sitting there,
but a decision has not been made.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10235-3
02:08:51.476 --> 02:08:52.916
<v Marwan Altaie>allocation or decision made.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10245-1
02:08:54.448 --> 02:08:59.402
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>I don't know if it would be a form for it,
because the idea that I was talking about</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10245-2
02:08:59.402 --> 02:08:59.636
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>was.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10270-0
02:09:01.316 --> 02:09:05.533
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>When we're getting asked to move the
money to the client account,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10270-1
02:09:05.533 --> 02:09:10.772
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>that's when the form would be completed.
We already kind of spoke about that last</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10270-2
02:09:10.772 --> 02:09:13.839
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>week,
so that form would contain the amount the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10270-3
02:09:13.839 --> 02:09:15.756
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>matter number, the client and.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10310-0
02:09:16.716 --> 02:09:19.131
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.
So that already be captured until such</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10310-1
02:09:19.131 --> 02:09:23.479
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>times that decisions then made and what's
to happen with the funds would have to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10310-2
02:09:23.479 --> 02:09:27.129
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>follow the the next process.
So whether that's a refund or we spoke</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10310-3
02:09:27.129 --> 02:09:29.383
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>about,
we'd get a refund form and it goes</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10310-4
02:09:29.383 --> 02:09:31.316
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>through a client payment process or.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10325-0
02:09:31.916 --> 02:09:34.553
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Identifying new invoices that we can,
we can then pay,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10325-1
02:09:34.553 --> 02:09:38.532
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>which would mean we're we're transferring
the money back from our client or office</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10325-2
02:09:38.532 --> 02:09:38.916
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>account.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10340-0
02:09:41.916 --> 02:09:46.922
<v Marwan Altaie>So is this process only ever initiated by
you and kashir and Martin to credit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10329-0
02:09:42.196 --> 02:09:42.356
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>S.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10340-1
02:09:46.922 --> 02:09:47.436
<v Marwan Altaie>control?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10371-0
02:09:48.396 --> 02:09:52.730
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So this all starts,
I think it's hard to kind of talk about</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10371-1
02:09:52.730 --> 02:09:58.366
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>it in one separate thing because money
could already be in the client account</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10371-2
02:09:58.366 --> 02:10:03.062
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>that Stephen's team is trying to to
offset against future bills.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10371-3
02:10:03.062 --> 02:10:04.796
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Now that's well but for.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10414-0
02:10:05.716 --> 02:10:09.280
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>This one particular scenario is it all
starts from the unallocated funds.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10414-1
02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:12.170
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We get unallocated funds,
we send it off to credit control,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10414-2
02:10:12.170 --> 02:10:14.867
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>credit control.
Say you don't know what these funds are</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10414-3
02:10:14.867 --> 02:10:18.142
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>for just now or there's a reason why we
can't allocate these funds,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10414-4
02:10:18.142 --> 02:10:21.996
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>move it to the client account and that's
when they fill out the table and then?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10437-0
02:10:22.316 --> 02:10:26.115
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We are, as cashiers,
aren't doing anything else with those</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10437-1
02:10:26.115 --> 02:10:30.623
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>monies until credit control come back to
us with further instruction.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10437-2
02:10:30.623 --> 02:10:34.745
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So it starts with us,
but it sits between both teams at certain</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10437-3
02:10:34.745 --> 02:10:35.196
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>stages.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10440-0
02:10:40.716 --> 02:10:41.756
<v Marwan Altaie>OK. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10480-0
02:10:42.436 --> 02:10:47.127
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Fair I think I feel like very similar to
what and I was talking about for their</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10480-1
02:10:47.127 --> 02:10:50.001
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>suspense account.
We sent off to credit control,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10480-2
02:10:50.001 --> 02:10:53.344
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>credit control,
give us an action to do we post into 3E,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10480-3
02:10:53.344 --> 02:10:58.036
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but then it kind of goes back to credit
control team member until they get the.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10486-0
02:10:59.076 --> 02:11:01.356
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>The desire of outcome.
What's to then happen with the funds?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10532-0
02:11:01.916 --> 02:11:05.350
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. So it's a good shot. Actually,
you're right. Exactly right.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10532-1
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:09.356
<v Marwan Altaie>It's actually very exactly the same,
isn't it? It's just different accounts,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10532-2
02:11:09.356 --> 02:11:12.791
<v Marwan Altaie>but the principle is the same.
It will go from cashiers to credit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10505-0
02:11:11.276 --> 02:11:11.556
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yep.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10532-3
02:11:12.791 --> 02:11:16.485
<v Marwan Altaie>control, credit control back to cashiers,
then back to credit control,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10532-4
02:11:16.485 --> 02:11:20.596
<v Marwan Altaie>credit control if it's not been allocated
or not decided what to do. Yeah. OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10520-0
02:11:16.876 --> 02:11:17.116
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10545-0
02:11:20.596 --> 02:11:23.247
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Difference been?
We've got the money in our client account</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10545-1
02:11:23.247 --> 02:11:26.617
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>against a specific client matter.
What is a suspense account isn't against</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10545-2
02:11:26.617 --> 02:11:27.876
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>a specific client matter so.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10546-0
02:11:29.076 --> 02:11:29.356
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10592-0
02:11:33.956 --> 02:11:37.700
<v Marwan Altaie>I think we'll probably take that away and
see what we can do with it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10592-1
02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:41.873
<v Marwan Altaie>It almost it almost sounds like it's a
different process to a certain extent.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10592-2
02:11:41.873 --> 02:11:44.654
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean it is cashiering and credit
control process,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10592-3
02:11:44.654 --> 02:11:48.880
<v Marwan Altaie>but if you're already capturing the data
and I'll need to confirm which actual</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10592-4
02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:51.716
<v Marwan Altaie>process this is,
we can potentially have a sub task.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10603-0
02:11:51.996 --> 02:11:55.336
<v Marwan Altaie>That becomes credit control.
Instead of having it completely separate,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10603-1
02:11:55.336 --> 02:11:57.876
<v Marwan Altaie>because then you're duplicating it a
little bit cool.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10644-0
02:12:00.356 --> 02:12:04.156
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't think it would say when we're
going through these processes because</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10644-1
02:12:04.156 --> 02:12:08.006
<v Marwan Altaie>sedating them properly because we're
taking all these down from service now.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10644-2
02:12:08.006 --> 02:12:11.906
<v Marwan Altaie>So from the service catalogue, sorry,
which is written by someone I think was</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10644-3
02:12:11.906 --> 02:12:14.206
<v Marwan Altaie>not a good day,
they don't always make sense.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10644-4
02:12:14.206 --> 02:12:17.356
<v Marwan Altaie>I think there's a real part on actually
what we need to do is.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10684-0
02:12:17.916 --> 02:12:21.242
<v Marwan Altaie>These are all like sub tasks of the
service,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10684-1
02:12:21.242 --> 02:12:27.451
<v Marwan Altaie>so the service needs to be right and that
probably sits in cash even and then these</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10684-2
02:12:27.451 --> 02:12:33.364
<v Marwan Altaie>are just sub tasks that move to you guys
and then back we probably start on the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10684-3
02:12:33.364 --> 02:12:37.356
<v Marwan Altaie>cash even site because what the
difficulty we've had.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10748-0
02:12:37.436 --> 02:12:40.989
<v Marwan Altaie>Up until we have these workshops,
as we've never really on the maps and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10748-1
02:12:40.989 --> 02:12:43.653
<v Marwan Altaie>stuff that hasn't been captured where it
moves. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10748-2
02:12:43.653 --> 02:12:47.650
<v Marwan Altaie>So that's what we're uncovering just now.
That's when we'll need have that extra</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10748-3
02:12:47.650 --> 02:12:51.499
<v Marwan Altaie>sessions that we talked about right at
the start of finance to connect to all</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10748-4
02:12:51.499 --> 02:12:54.263
<v Marwan Altaie>together. Yeah.
But at least you're getting into it and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10748-5
02:12:54.263 --> 02:12:57.076
<v Marwan Altaie>it's good information and good. Yeah,
absolutely it has.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10789-0
02:12:57.236 --> 02:12:59.547
<v Marwan Altaie>It's it's a necessary way that we need to
go through.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10789-1
02:12:59.547 --> 02:13:02.286
<v Marwan Altaie>It's just a shame we can't decide how
we're going to do it yet,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10789-2
02:13:02.286 --> 02:13:05.752
<v Marwan Altaie>but it's what we need to pull out. Oh,
of course. I'll. I'll leave this for now.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10789-3
02:13:05.752 --> 02:13:09.347
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't think it's worth getting into any
more detail until we do get into the cash</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10789-4
02:13:09.347 --> 02:13:12.943
<v Marwan Altaie>sharing bit. So just for the sake of time,
I'm going to move on from managing funds</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10789-5
02:13:12.943 --> 02:13:13.756
<v Marwan Altaie>and client account.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10802-0
02:13:14.316 --> 02:13:17.616
<v Marwan Altaie>We've done this one.
Everyone's happy for the most part.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10802-1
02:13:17.616 --> 02:13:20.916
<v Marwan Altaie>Is this worth running through with Martin
as well or OK?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10804-0
02:13:23.476 --> 02:13:24.196
<v Marwan Altaie>That one.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10819-0
02:13:25.596 --> 02:13:30.450
<v Marwan Altaie>Add that by off. I'm also fine with,
so we're gonna move on,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10819-1
02:13:30.450 --> 02:13:33.236
<v Marwan Altaie>write off exchange rate difference.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10852-0
02:13:35.036 --> 02:13:39.390
<v Marwan Altaie>So the bandit write off and write off
exchange are two separate processes,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10852-1
02:13:39.390 --> 02:13:44.150
<v Marwan Altaie>but is it a case of you want them to be
separate or is it just something that can</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10852-2
02:13:44.150 --> 02:13:48.156
<v Marwan Altaie>be combined into a generic write off or
they're different? OK, fine.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10902-0
02:13:50.156 --> 02:13:52.588
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool,
I have accounted for it to be different,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10902-1
02:13:52.588 --> 02:13:56.521
<v Marwan Altaie>but I was just wondering if it was
something that should have been combined</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10902-2
02:13:56.521 --> 02:14:00.661
<v Marwan Altaie>potentially, but that's fine. So yeah,
exchange difference identified and needs</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10902-3
02:14:00.661 --> 02:14:04.543
<v Marwan Altaie>resolving in terms of the process,
cashier raises the FX loss so it starts</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10902-4
02:14:04.543 --> 02:14:06.975
<v Marwan Altaie>with the cashier credit control,
team reviews,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10902-5
02:14:06.975 --> 02:14:09.356
<v Marwan Altaie>partner approval for over 100,
000 different.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10906-0
02:14:10.516 --> 02:14:14.076
<v Marwan Altaie>I did have a question about that.
Is there no other? Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10910-0
02:14:15.556 --> 02:14:19.476
<v Marwan Altaie>OK. I figure 100,000 FX difference, OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10918-0
02:14:33.076 --> 02:14:34.716
<v Marwan Altaie>We've got, we've got a mic here.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10925-0
02:14:41.876 --> 02:14:42.996
<v Marwan Altaie>Sure, I'll put that, I'll put that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10940-0
02:14:59.276 --> 02:15:03.276
<v Marwan Altaie>You're good. So. Yeah.
So we we receive the account receive</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10940-1
02:15:03.276 --> 02:15:05.876
<v Marwan Altaie>about it. Can you hear me? OK. Awesome.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10942-0
02:15:06.516 --> 02:15:06.956
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10975-0
02:15:07.796 --> 02:15:12.777
<v Marwan Altaie>So we receive an amount into the account
and there is an FX difference.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10975-1
02:15:12.777 --> 02:15:17.481
<v Marwan Altaie>So the clients paid in a different
currency to that of the invoice.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10975-2
02:15:17.481 --> 02:15:21.356
<v Marwan Altaie>So we take all the pluses,
but if it's an underpayment.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10980-0
02:15:22.756 --> 02:15:25.436
<v Marwan Altaie>There is a decision needs to be made on
how to deal with that underpayment.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10995-0
02:15:26.796 --> 02:15:30.804
<v Marwan Altaie>How and I actually to confess,
I don't actually know what the process is</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10995-1
02:15:30.804 --> 02:15:33.934
<v Marwan Altaie>in the UK. Do you do?
If there's a difference in the UK?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/10995-2
02:15:33.934 --> 02:15:35.636
<v Marwan Altaie>It depends on what the summers.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11007-0
02:15:41.956 --> 02:15:45.396
<v Marwan Altaie>Barty, do you have a threshold?
You just write off yourself or.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11010-0
02:15:46.036 --> 02:15:47.356
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Nope. So we would.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11030-0
02:15:49.756 --> 02:15:54.337
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>We would take an e-mail from credit
control and we wouldn't question that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11020-0
02:15:53.316 --> 02:15:53.436
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11030-1
02:15:54.337 --> 02:15:57.556
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>some, though,
everything's been all agreed already.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11038-0
02:15:59.396 --> 02:16:01.476
<v Marwan Altaie>And then what do you do on your side?
So what's?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11042-0
02:16:04.636 --> 02:16:05.996
<v Marwan Altaie>We'd send instruction to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11057-0
02:16:09.396 --> 02:16:11.833
<v Marwan Altaie>Thomas,
do you have like an amount where you</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11057-1
02:16:11.833 --> 02:16:14.325
<v Marwan Altaie>could say I don't care, just write off?
Sure.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11057-2
02:16:14.325 --> 02:16:17.196
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm sure there is a threshold trying to
find it now.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11088-0
02:16:20.196 --> 02:16:24.764
<v Marwan Altaie>If the decisions are if it's a small
amount and even one of the seniors or</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11088-1
02:16:24.764 --> 02:16:27.749
<v Marwan Altaie>myself,
or one of the seniors in Australia would</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11088-2
02:16:27.749 --> 02:16:30.673
<v Marwan Altaie>just say look, don't worry,
just get rid of it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11088-3
02:16:30.673 --> 02:16:34.876
<v Marwan Altaie>it gets written off to an FXGL.
I'm guessing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11125-0
02:16:35.236 --> 02:16:40.895
<v Marwan Altaie>I would always recommend to my team to
look at both the value and the amount</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11125-1
02:16:40.895 --> 02:16:45.892
<v Marwan Altaie>like the proportion of the underpayment
versus what we've received.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11125-2
02:16:45.892 --> 02:16:50.375
<v Marwan Altaie>We've received 600,
000 Australian dollars and the write off</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11125-3
02:16:50.375 --> 02:16:53.756
<v Marwan Altaie>is the unders is like 500 Australian
dollars.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11153-0
02:16:54.396 --> 02:16:58.216
<v Marwan Altaie>Then that's worth you know,
that's worth writing off to FX,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11153-1
02:16:58.216 --> 02:17:02.990
<v Marwan Altaie>in my opinion. If it's an invoice of $10,
000 and the under is 500 or 600,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11153-2
02:17:02.990 --> 02:17:06.556
<v Marwan Altaie>then I'd probably be questioning what's
that threshold.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11179-0
02:17:10.156 --> 02:17:13.488
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, definitely like someone.
Some amounts are no brainers,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11179-1
02:17:13.488 --> 02:17:16.438
<v Marwan Altaie>but then some.
I would always assess based off. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11179-2
02:17:16.438 --> 02:17:19.716
<v Marwan Altaie>that percentage of what the overall
amount we received was.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11230-0
02:17:19.836 --> 02:17:22.821
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah,
we we did a check as well because we have</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11230-1
02:17:22.821 --> 02:17:27.796
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we we can get asked to for example we
receive 1000 lbs in an invoices 1100 lbs.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11230-2
02:17:27.796 --> 02:17:32.895
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Sometimes we've been asked to write the
£100 off as an FX, but when we review it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11230-3
02:17:32.895 --> 02:17:35.196
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we say we've been paid in pounds and.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11267-0
02:17:35.716 --> 02:17:38.262
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>The bill was in pound,
so this isn't an actual FX.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11267-1
02:17:38.262 --> 02:17:41.857
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>It's a short pay because again,
I have a credit receipts in the UK will</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11267-2
02:17:41.857 --> 02:17:44.853
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>show as if funds have been converted from
another currency.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11267-3
02:17:44.853 --> 02:17:48.099
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So it's easy to identify if it's actually
an FX or not. So yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11267-4
02:17:48.099 --> 02:17:50.596
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we would always have a a quick look over
it, but.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11275-0
02:17:51.956 --> 02:17:55.036
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>If it was a genuine FX,
we wouldn't question any values.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11293-0
02:17:58.636 --> 02:18:02.389
<v Marwan Altaie>Do Martin do you also have a small
balance write off with like?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11286-0
02:18:01.636 --> 02:18:01.956
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11293-1
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:04.676
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah like 1 LB difference or something.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11302-0
02:18:05.116 --> 02:18:09.956
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah, we we'll do it up to.
I think it's £20. We do it for.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11322-0
02:18:11.116 --> 02:18:14.154
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, we'll probably be the same. OK, so,
so for this,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11322-1
02:18:14.154 --> 02:18:17.247
<v Marwan Altaie>I guess the process is pretty similar.
I there's an FX,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11322-2
02:18:17.247 --> 02:18:19.236
<v Marwan Altaie>specifically an FX difference under.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11330-0
02:18:20.476 --> 02:18:23.436
<v Marwan Altaie>Decision is made whether we're going to
write off FX.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11349-0
02:18:24.956 --> 02:18:30.284
<v Marwan Altaie>L you're going to go out to a partner?
Fine and say you've underpaid what we do</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11349-1
02:18:30.284 --> 02:18:34.480
<v Marwan Altaie>might give us advice,
or the client might say sorry. Everyone.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11349-2
02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:38.476
<v Marwan Altaie>Currency. I'll pay you the right currency,
whatever it may.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11390-0
02:18:41.356 --> 02:18:45.693
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, so apart from the 100,000,
which was probably due to a sleepless,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11390-1
02:18:45.693 --> 02:18:49.659
<v Marwan Altaie>sleepless night, I was, yeah,
I'm sure that that was, yeah, no,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11390-2
02:18:49.659 --> 02:18:53.067
<v Marwan Altaie>ignore the 100,000.
That's a sleepless night. So yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11390-3
02:18:53.067 --> 02:18:58.396
<v Marwan Altaie>FXGL process for the most part is correct.
We just need to understand the thresholds.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11411-0
02:18:58.756 --> 02:19:02.300
<v Marwan Altaie>But ultimately,
it's a simple process and it's worth</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11411-1
02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:06.913
<v Marwan Altaie>accounting for in the system.
Oz and the UK seems like it's the same</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11411-2
02:19:06.913 --> 02:19:07.716
<v Marwan Altaie>safe to say.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11422-0
02:19:09.636 --> 02:19:11.688
<v Marwan Altaie>Might be different,
but I think we we can account for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11422-1
02:19:11.688 --> 02:19:12.676
<v Marwan Altaie>thresholds the same, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11474-0
02:19:15.076 --> 02:19:17.482
<v Marwan Altaie>It doesn't have to be now,
but after the meeting,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11474-1
02:19:17.482 --> 02:19:20.417
<v Marwan Altaie>if you ping me across the threshold so we
can document them.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11474-2
02:19:20.417 --> 02:19:23.689
<v Marwan Altaie>Same with the Australia side,
just so we can then start rooting and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11474-3
02:19:23.689 --> 02:19:26.481
<v Marwan Altaie>creating those workflows.
Once we do get to the solution,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11474-4
02:19:26.481 --> 02:19:29.801
<v Marwan Altaie>that'll be quite helpful finishes the
process is with cashier again,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11474-5
02:19:29.801 --> 02:19:32.159
<v Marwan Altaie>do we notify any individual teams on
completion,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11474-6
02:19:32.159 --> 02:19:34.036
<v Marwan Altaie>do we go back to the client or partner?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11480-0
02:19:34.076 --> 02:19:37.938
<v Marwan Altaie>Or anyone just saying it's done?
Or is it a discussion has had it does get</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11480-1
02:19:37.938 --> 02:19:38.196
<v Marwan Altaie>done.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11515-0
02:19:40.156 --> 02:19:43.417
<v Marwan Altaie>Should be discussions had already.
If it's a pretty controller,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11515-1
02:19:43.417 --> 02:19:47.239
<v Marwan Altaie>made a decision on their own and that's
fine. No one needs to be notified,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11515-2
02:19:47.239 --> 02:19:51.366
<v Marwan Altaie>they'll just tell issues they've gone to
the partner and the partner said, yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11515-3
02:19:51.366 --> 02:19:54.220
<v Marwan Altaie>that's OK. Then again, that'll be,
I think that's fine.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11515-4
02:19:54.220 --> 02:19:55.596
<v Marwan Altaie>So I don't think there's a.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11518-0
02:19:56.716 --> 02:20:00.396
<v Marwan Altaie>That's it.
There's any need to send that out, but.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11537-0
02:20:03.676 --> 02:20:09.373
<v Marwan Altaie>Evidence sounds like the same.
Do we need to post any approval of the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11537-1
02:20:09.373 --> 02:20:13.036
<v Marwan Altaie>partner or client construction enclosure
or?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11542-0
02:20:15.596 --> 02:20:18.316
<v Marwan Altaie>Pressure.
If it's more child that the partners.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11554-0
02:20:23.116 --> 02:20:25.876
<v Marwan Altaie>That is more than the threshold is worth
having that evidence of approval.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11557-0
02:20:27.476 --> 02:20:28.316
<v Marwan Altaie>You do that, Martin.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11571-0
02:20:29.956 --> 02:20:32.096
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>OK.
Maybe just take the credit control e-mail.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11571-1
02:20:32.096 --> 02:20:34.236
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So we wouldn't be seeking any other
approvals.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11568-0
02:20:33.236 --> 02:20:33.436
<v Marwan Altaie>That's.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11597-0
02:20:34.876 --> 02:20:38.056
<v Marwan Altaie>So that's your evidence.
Once you've got that credit card e-mail,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11582-0
02:20:37.516 --> 02:20:38.236
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11597-1
02:20:38.056 --> 02:20:41.381
<v Marwan Altaie>you take that as you. Yeah. Got you. Yeah,
we can do the same. Like,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11597-2
02:20:41.381 --> 02:20:44.996
<v Marwan Altaie>I'd assume that the credit control would
have got. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11607-0
02:20:46.476 --> 02:20:49.438
<v Marwan Altaie>So do we want evidence,
or do we want the approval made by the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11607-1
02:20:49.438 --> 02:20:52.636
<v Marwan Altaie>credit controller to be the approval
system? The assumption that's.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11628-0
02:20:55.396 --> 02:20:57.677
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, OK. I'm.
I'm just thinking more from ServiceNow</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11628-1
02:20:57.677 --> 02:21:00.000
<v Marwan Altaie>perspective,
if you're trying to pull out that data in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11628-2
02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.042
<v Marwan Altaie>the future and then you just have a
decision made by credit controller,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11628-3
02:21:03.042 --> 02:21:03.676
<v Marwan Altaie>is that enough?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11646-0
02:21:06.436 --> 02:21:08.980
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah,
the approval will need to be on the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11646-1
02:21:08.980 --> 02:21:13.584
<v Marwan Altaie>credit control process, absolutely,
because we need to capture the evidence</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11646-2
02:21:13.584 --> 02:21:16.916
<v Marwan Altaie>of that conversation.
Just attach the something, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11659-0
02:21:21.956 --> 02:21:26.254
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. And then Slas,
are we defining the same as we just</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11659-1
02:21:26.254 --> 02:21:28.516
<v Marwan Altaie>wanted 2448 hours turn around?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11674-0
02:21:31.756 --> 02:21:35.536
<v Marwan Altaie>OK,
objections correct do 12 hours if you</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11674-1
02:21:35.536 --> 02:21:40.396
<v Marwan Altaie>want. If you want to be efficient. No,
no takers, OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11673-0
02:21:41.076 --> 02:21:41.196
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11727-0
02:21:42.196 --> 02:21:46.003
<v Marwan Altaie>And get something that we don't
necessarily manage just now SL ES or OL</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11727-1
02:21:46.003 --> 02:21:48.330
<v Marwan Altaie>ES.
So it's something that we will pay more</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11727-2
02:21:48.330 --> 02:21:51.133
<v Marwan Altaie>attention to and we're putting them into
the system.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11727-3
02:21:51.133 --> 02:21:54.359
<v Marwan Altaie>But just now trying to guess them,
we just don't measure it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11727-4
02:21:54.359 --> 02:21:57.956
<v Marwan Altaie>So we don't know. Yeah, it sounds right.
Sounds like a good number.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11732-0
02:21:59.516 --> 02:22:02.116
<v Marwan Altaie>Same page as me as proceeding is just ASA.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11747-0
02:22:06.436 --> 02:22:08.916
<v Marwan Altaie>You need to be on the mic. Oh, sorry.
Martin,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11747-1
02:22:08.916 --> 02:22:12.636
<v Marwan Altaie>do you think receding just needs to be
ASAP? Anything to do with it?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11778-0
02:22:12.236 --> 02:22:14.217
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah,
we we will always clear the same day if</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11778-1
02:22:14.217 --> 02:22:16.673
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>we can, not if we can,
but if it goes to credit control,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11778-2
02:22:16.673 --> 02:22:19.990
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>credit control comes back because it's
it's done straight away kind of thing</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11778-3
02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:22.100
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>unless it was to come very last minute in
a day,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11778-4
02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:24.556
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>but it'd be picked up first thing next
morning. So yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11782-0
02:22:26.076 --> 02:22:27.276
<v Marwan Altaie>That's our SLA right now.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11822-0
02:22:28.556 --> 02:22:31.072
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So there's sort of just to go off maybe
tangent here.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11822-1
02:22:31.072 --> 02:22:34.938
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>This is one example of when we might have
a balance that is standing on an invoice</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11822-2
02:22:34.938 --> 02:22:37.594
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>that has to be cleared without any more
money coming in.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11822-3
02:22:37.594 --> 02:22:40.948
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>But there is other examples of and I
don't know if they'll be captured.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11822-4
02:22:40.948 --> 02:22:43.278
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>It was fairly,
it could be bank charges have been</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11822-5
02:22:43.278 --> 02:22:44.676
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>deducted over folding tax but.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11829-0
02:22:45.076 --> 02:22:49.196
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>They all kind of follow the same the same
process as as this I don't know.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11841-0
02:22:50.556 --> 02:22:55.036
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>That's something to consider here as well
of those other slides to cover them off.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11833-0
02:22:50.916 --> 02:22:51.116
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11869-0
02:22:56.236 --> 02:22:59.919
<v Marwan Altaie>They weren't included on the in the
credit control slide, so I'll check.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11869-1
02:22:59.919 --> 02:23:02.644
<v Marwan Altaie>They're probably the same.
I'm assuming bank charges.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11869-2
02:23:02.644 --> 02:23:06.076
<v Marwan Altaie>You don't consult credit control at all,
so I'm assuming that's 60.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11909-0
02:23:06.356 --> 02:23:08.707
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.
So we we would always clear bank charges</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11909-1
02:23:08.707 --> 02:23:11.059
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>down,
but there's one just slipped through the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11909-2
02:23:11.059 --> 02:23:15.061
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>net and credit the control will reach out
to us and say like this 7 LB or 10 LB</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11909-3
02:23:15.061 --> 02:23:17.313
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>outstanding going to going to clear it
down.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11909-4
02:23:17.313 --> 02:23:21.015
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>So we've been the exact same as this
right off one we would we would just</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11909-5
02:23:21.015 --> 02:23:21.916
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>stand action that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11942-0
02:23:22.436 --> 02:23:26.156
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>And then withholding tax and voices,
we tend to not know about it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11942-1
02:23:26.156 --> 02:23:30.098
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>and it has to be credit controlled.
It comes out to us and says, like,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11942-2
02:23:30.098 --> 02:23:34.040
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>there's X amount of withholding tax and
it's to be cleared down again,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11942-3
02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:37.316
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>same as as this example,
we would just think go and do it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11978-0
02:23:37.756 --> 02:23:42.249
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>The only difference being is there's more
than one withholding tax general Ledger</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11978-1
02:23:42.249 --> 02:23:44.879
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>code,
so there would have to be somewhere where</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11978-2
02:23:44.879 --> 02:23:48.989
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>even if it was just a open text box for
credit control could say this is a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11978-3
02:23:48.989 --> 02:23:51.236
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>specific withholding tax code to be used.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/11979-0
02:23:53.116 --> 02:23:54.036
<v Marwan Altaie>And just a few minutes ago.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12027-0
02:23:55.476 --> 02:23:59.654
<v Marwan Altaie>We can have if there is multiple
processes that follow the same kind of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12027-1
02:23:59.654 --> 02:24:03.078
<v Marwan Altaie>structure as this,
we can't have drop downs for stuff like</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12027-2
02:24:03.078 --> 02:24:07.083
<v Marwan Altaie>withholding tax or any other stuff.
I don't know any other examples,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12027-3
02:24:07.083 --> 02:24:11.726
<v Marwan Altaie>but have it on the same ticket but have
it as a separate drop down and route it</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12027-4
02:24:11.726 --> 02:24:14.396
<v Marwan Altaie>potentially to a different reporting code
or.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12066-0
02:24:15.916 --> 02:24:19.677
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, something along.
Just wonder if there's or if it's just a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12030-0
02:24:16.996 --> 02:24:17.316
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12066-1
02:24:19.677 --> 02:24:23.438
<v Marwan Altaie>query into cashiering.
So when credit control need to raise it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12066-2
02:24:23.438 --> 02:24:27.257
<v Marwan Altaie>they raise it as a query under the
general query for cashiering,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12053-0
02:24:26.636 --> 02:24:26.956
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12066-3
02:24:27.257 --> 02:24:30.196
<v Marwan Altaie>and then the system recognises based on
keywords.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12097-0
02:24:30.756 --> 02:24:34.640
<v Marwan Altaie>What it is that's coming in so it
categorises on cashier inside,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12080-0
02:24:34.236 --> 02:24:34.596
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Nice.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12097-1
02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:39.241
<v Marwan Altaie>it's a few and far between rather than
attaching it to a workflow that isn't</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12089-0
02:24:38.076 --> 02:24:38.356
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12097-2
02:24:39.241 --> 02:24:40.556
<v Marwan Altaie>about what it's about.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12123-0
02:24:39.956 --> 02:24:43.220
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>I would say it's that's not something we
need to think too much about.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12123-1
02:24:43.220 --> 02:24:47.037
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>It's just a very simple request. So yeah,
if that could be a quick way of doing it</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12110-0
02:24:45.196 --> 02:24:45.356
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12115-0
02:24:46.596 --> 02:24:46.716
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12123-2
02:24:47.037 --> 02:24:49.796
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>then I don't think anybody would have any
issues with that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12132-0
02:24:57.316 --> 02:25:01.276
<v Marwan Altaie>I found the it's £100 it's less than 100
lbs.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12173-0
02:25:02.876 --> 02:25:06.288
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes, it's not 100,000, it's £100.
It's 100.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12173-1
02:25:06.288 --> 02:25:12.259
<v Marwan Altaie>00 in the probably meant to stop and
ended up clicking the K it's all right,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12173-2
02:25:12.259 --> 02:25:17.610
<v Marwan Altaie>making sure everyone's paying attention.
Good job then that purpose.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12158-0
02:25:15.996 --> 02:25:16.996
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Just a small difference.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12173-3
02:25:17.610 --> 02:25:21.876
<v Marwan Altaie>Didn't you just to test this exactly?
No one's asleep.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12186-0
02:25:21.956 --> 02:25:26.430
<v Marwan Altaie>Sleep, yet? So clearly we're doing well.
OK, cool. So that's fine.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12172-0
02:25:23.556 --> 02:25:23.676
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12186-1
02:25:26.430 --> 02:25:30.236
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm happy with the flow for the most part,
that's clear.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12214-0
02:25:33.596 --> 02:25:38.140
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool. I think we're good for that.
So let's move on.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12214-1
02:25:38.140 --> 02:25:45.256
<v Marwan Altaie>Is everyone happy with the write off and
yeah, cool. Another data capture section.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12214-2
02:25:45.256 --> 02:25:50.744
<v Marwan Altaie>So do request type region entity doesn't
sound like we need it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12214-3
02:25:50.744 --> 02:25:52.716
<v Marwan Altaie>so I'm going to remove.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12217-0
02:25:53.796 --> 02:25:55.396
<v Marwan Altaie>Entity submitted by we need.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12252-0
02:25:57.236 --> 02:26:01.751
<v Marwan Altaie>And is the assumption that all of these
fields and form captures are going to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12252-1
02:26:01.751 --> 02:26:06.440
<v Marwan Altaie>have a behalf on behalf of a standard? OK,
so I'm I'm not going to include that,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12252-2
02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:08.988
<v Marwan Altaie>but when I send out the summary
afterwards,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12252-3
02:26:08.988 --> 02:26:13.156
<v Marwan Altaie>that will be included variance,
amount I'm assuming is mandatory. Cool.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12257-0
02:26:14.196 --> 02:26:15.796
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah,
you kind of need to know the total amount.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12273-0
02:26:18.356 --> 02:26:28.218
<v Marwan Altaie>So currency and variance with discrepancy
or what balance balance, yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12273-1
02:26:28.218 --> 02:26:32.676
<v Marwan Altaie>that's over balance or something.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12282-0
02:26:33.796 --> 02:26:37.538
<v Marwan Altaie>So total amount is a good one.
I didn't include that X.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12282-1
02:26:37.538 --> 02:26:39.476
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we just put FX difference?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12291-0
02:26:41.836 --> 02:26:44.501
<v Marwan Altaie>Total amount and sort of varying amount.
It's FX different, yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12291-1
02:26:44.501 --> 02:26:46.076
<v Marwan Altaie>because that's what they're writing on.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12305-0
02:26:49.116 --> 02:26:53.661
<v Marwan Altaie>Difference also I've got FX difference
currency,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12305-1
02:26:53.661 --> 02:26:57.836
<v Marwan Altaie>total amount we want bank posting
reference.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12309-0
02:27:04.716 --> 02:27:05.996
<v Marwan Altaie>I'll explain most different stuff.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12311-0
02:27:09.156 --> 02:27:09.836
<v Marwan Altaie>Invoice number.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12312-0
02:27:11.156 --> 02:27:12.076
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12325-0
02:27:13.876 --> 02:27:16.613
<v Marwan Altaie>Reason we said,
just leave as a open text field option or</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12325-1
02:27:16.613 --> 02:27:18.076
<v Marwan Altaie>if there's more context needed.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12330-0
02:27:19.396 --> 02:27:21.636
<v Marwan Altaie>This request type would be FX different
so.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12332-0
02:27:25.836 --> 02:27:26.436
<v Marwan Altaie>Oh, OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12360-0
02:27:28.236 --> 02:27:30.825
<v Marwan Altaie>Again, this is just another one,
so when it does come in, yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12360-1
02:27:30.825 --> 02:27:33.252
<v Marwan Altaie>make the approval easier kind of
justifies it a little bit,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12360-2
02:27:33.252 --> 02:27:35.356
<v Marwan Altaie>but it's not mandatory.
It's a it's a nice to have.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12370-0
02:27:37.196 --> 02:27:41.119
<v Marwan Altaie>Do they need to give justification just
now? Oh, it's just FX is FX. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12370-1
02:27:41.119 --> 02:27:43.316
<v Marwan Altaie>I think we just one of those things, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12397-0
02:27:47.036 --> 02:27:49.817
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, yeah,
initial comments might be good because</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12397-1
02:27:49.817 --> 02:27:52.872
<v Marwan Altaie>you might want to write down why it's an
FX difference.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12397-2
02:27:52.872 --> 02:27:57.399
<v Marwan Altaie>So client has paid Japanese yen into AUS
dollar account or something that I see at</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12397-3
02:27:57.399 --> 02:27:59.036
<v Marwan Altaie>least identify repeat vendors.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12412-0
02:28:02.636 --> 02:28:05.803
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool. Yeah,
I've I've changed that to additional</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12412-1
02:28:05.803 --> 02:28:09.035
<v Marwan Altaie>comments.
So we'll use that going forward and any</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12412-2
02:28:09.035 --> 02:28:10.716
<v Marwan Altaie>attachment evidence items.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12415-0
02:28:12.956 --> 02:28:13.956
<v Marwan Altaie>Discussions had.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12416-0
02:28:15.436 --> 02:28:15.916
<v Marwan Altaie>Get the violence.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12451-0
02:28:20.156 --> 02:28:25.278
<v Marwan Altaie>Just get an e-mail to say. Yeah. Yeah.
So do I need anything or approval e-mail</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12451-1
02:28:25.278 --> 02:28:29.760
<v Marwan Altaie>or discussion e-mail? Look,
you you might get approval e-mail I guess</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12451-2
02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:32.769
<v Marwan Altaie>attached.
So you attach functionality but that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12451-3
02:28:32.769 --> 02:28:37.699
<v Marwan Altaie>means I think we said the early we would
leave it as optional for everything</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12451-4
02:28:37.699 --> 02:28:38.276
<v Marwan Altaie>probably.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12479-0
02:28:39.596 --> 02:28:42.975
<v Marwan Altaie>OK. I'll just assume,
would we want that for everything</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12479-1
02:28:42.975 --> 02:28:45.691
<v Marwan Altaie>optional?
I think that's a fair thing to do,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12479-2
02:28:45.691 --> 02:28:49.734
<v Marwan Altaie>isn't it when you're doing forms that
it's an optional attachment,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12472-0
02:28:48.956 --> 02:28:49.356
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12479-3
02:28:49.734 --> 02:28:53.476
<v Marwan Altaie>if it's needed optional across all,
I'll make a note of that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12481-0
02:28:54.316 --> 02:28:55.116
<v Marwan Altaie>And.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12490-0
02:28:57.636 --> 02:29:00.477
<v Marwan Altaie>Got client matter on here,
but I don't think that's needed in this</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12490-1
02:29:00.477 --> 02:29:01.156
<v Marwan Altaie>scenario. Is it?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12499-0
02:29:03.196 --> 02:29:05.356
<v Marwan Altaie>We have the invoice number and we have
everything else.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12498-0
02:29:04.556 --> 02:29:04.836
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12506-0
02:29:08.276 --> 02:29:09.636
<v Marwan Altaie>We could to exclude climate matter.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12513-0
02:29:11.196 --> 02:29:12.276
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, we happy to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12520-0
02:29:11.916 --> 02:29:14.316
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah, because we,
we we would always do the search from the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12520-1
02:29:14.316 --> 02:29:16.076
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>invoice number,
so that wouldn't be needed.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12526-0
02:29:17.076 --> 02:29:19.196
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, I think place the.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12553-0
02:29:25.196 --> 02:29:27.539
<v Marwan Altaie>Wrong invoice number or you know there's
a typo.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12553-1
02:29:27.539 --> 02:29:29.787
<v Marwan Altaie>There's having the matter or the client
there.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12553-2
02:29:29.787 --> 02:29:33.708
<v Marwan Altaie>Just give a little bit of extra useful
info, but if the invoice number was wrong,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12553-3
02:29:33.708 --> 02:29:35.956
<v Marwan Altaie>you'd have to go and check it anyway,
because.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12566-0
02:29:37.716 --> 02:29:40.439
<v Marwan Altaie>She needs to know what invoice does to
know the amount to know whether it's a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12566-1
02:29:40.439 --> 02:29:41.556
<v Marwan Altaie>rare instantly write off or not.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12599-0
02:29:42.436 --> 02:29:45.129
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Yeah,
I think I think if someone put in the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12599-1
02:29:45.129 --> 02:29:49.903
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>wrong invoice number and they're putting
the variance amount and somehow that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12599-2
02:29:49.903 --> 02:29:53.881
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>wrong invoice number also had this the
the same variance amount,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12599-3
02:29:53.881 --> 02:29:57.676
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>then it'd be very, very,
very coincidental. I don't see that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12604-0
02:29:57.996 --> 02:29:59.876
<v Marwan Altaie>You've got enough inference Finder for,
yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12602-0
02:29:58.196 --> 02:29:58.996
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Happening video film.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12605-0
02:30:01.516 --> 02:30:01.636
<v Marwan Altaie>But.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12648-0
02:30:04.556 --> 02:30:07.997
<v Marwan Altaie>We did quite good for time,
so we've got through the bulk of the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12648-1
02:30:07.997 --> 02:30:10.274
<v Marwan Altaie>processes.
There's a few consideration and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12648-2
02:30:10.274 --> 02:30:14.404
<v Marwan Altaie>cashiering nuances now that we'll take
away and we'll come back and we'll see</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12648-3
02:30:14.404 --> 02:30:18.640
<v Marwan Altaie>what the best possible solutions are.
But are we happy that we've collected the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12648-4
02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:22.876
<v Marwan Altaie>bulk of credit control processes at this
stage or is there anything we want to?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12650-0
02:30:24.156 --> 02:30:24.836
<v Marwan Altaie>Highlights.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12653-0
02:30:25.996 --> 02:30:26.916
<v Marwan Altaie>Funds that we have.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12689-0
02:30:28.236 --> 02:30:32.615
<v Marwan Altaie>Just look at. Yes, OK. I would like,
is there anything else outside of that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12689-1
02:30:32.615 --> 02:30:36.821
<v Marwan Altaie>now that we've talked documented here
that are the actual credit control</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12689-2
02:30:36.821 --> 02:30:40.048
<v Marwan Altaie>process, for example,
the tracing of clients and stuff,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12689-3
02:30:40.048 --> 02:30:42.814
<v Marwan Altaie>stuff that we, we knew that assumed that,
yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12689-4
02:30:42.814 --> 02:30:46.156
<v Marwan Altaie>could we not have got the integrations
but at some point?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12691-0
02:30:46.796 --> 02:30:47.476
<v Marwan Altaie>Should think about it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12716-0
02:30:50.116 --> 02:30:58.199
<v Marwan Altaie>I've read the service now credit control
stuff and he said it could be told me as</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12716-1
02:30:58.199 --> 02:31:03.127
<v Marwan Altaie>well. I OK,
so I think that's fair and I think we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12716-2
02:31:03.127 --> 02:31:09.436
<v Marwan Altaie>probably do need to have those
conversations. It's probably no.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12760-0
02:31:09.596 --> 02:31:12.503
<v Marwan Altaie>Priority though,
and I mean like from an ask perspective,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12760-1
02:31:12.503 --> 02:31:16.362
<v Marwan Altaie>we do want to have those conversations,
but it's maybe for you guys to think</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12760-2
02:31:16.362 --> 02:31:20.272
<v Marwan Altaie>about when's the right time that we do
that based on all the other priorities</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12760-3
02:31:20.272 --> 02:31:23.981
<v Marwan Altaie>that we have. So we're there's a,
there would be a certain point where we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12760-4
02:31:23.981 --> 02:31:25.836
<v Marwan Altaie>start to look at phase two items and.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12800-0
02:31:26.916 --> 02:31:30.179
<v Marwan Altaie>There's a whole Rd mapping that we need
to think about in the backlog of of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12800-1
02:31:30.179 --> 02:31:32.798
<v Marwan Altaie>different use cases.
That's definitely a point which we need</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12800-2
02:31:32.798 --> 02:31:34.774
<v Marwan Altaie>to kind of start to have those
conversations.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12800-3
02:31:34.774 --> 02:31:38.209
<v Marwan Altaie>It's probably close to the January though
that we're going to start to do that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12800-4
02:31:38.209 --> 02:31:40.957
<v Marwan Altaie>There was a plans week in which we start
to talk through those.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12800-5
02:31:40.957 --> 02:31:43.276
<v Marwan Altaie>So that's perfect time for us to go
through that and.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12837-0
02:31:43.476 --> 02:31:46.622
<v Marwan Altaie>We'll have a similar session just to
understand your processes and what do</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12837-1
02:31:46.622 --> 02:31:50.062
<v Marwan Altaie>they look like today. How do they operate?
And then how do we potentially look at</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12837-2
02:31:50.062 --> 02:31:53.125
<v Marwan Altaie>things like use cases for service now as
well so we can go through that,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12837-3
02:31:53.125 --> 02:31:56.439
<v Marwan Altaie>but we'll take a note just to make sure
that we've got the the set next set of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12837-4
02:31:56.439 --> 02:31:58.076
<v Marwan Altaie>use cases of us to think about as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12872-0
02:31:58.676 --> 02:32:02.269
<v Marwan Altaie>This also links that we're talking about
before with this three. Don't know.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12872-1
02:32:02.269 --> 02:32:06.049
<v Marwan Altaie>Like what we're going to end up with in
the credit control space because we have</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12872-2
02:32:06.049 --> 02:32:09.222
<v Marwan Altaie>a very customised credit control,
which limits us in some respects,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12872-3
02:32:09.222 --> 02:32:12.956
<v Marwan Altaie>but also benefits enough because we've
got a lot of full customizations that do</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12872-4
02:32:12.956 --> 02:32:13.236
<v Marwan Altaie>stuff.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12909-0
02:32:14.196 --> 02:32:18.068
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't know where we're going to end up
or we could end up with something that's</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12909-1
02:32:18.068 --> 02:32:21.469
<v Marwan Altaie>rubbish and use anything else,
or we could end up with something that's</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12909-2
02:32:21.469 --> 02:32:24.161
<v Marwan Altaie>just super duper,
in which case we might want to use it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12909-3
02:32:24.161 --> 02:32:26.380
<v Marwan Altaie>I just don't know where we're going to
end up,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12909-4
02:32:26.380 --> 02:32:29.356
<v Marwan Altaie>so I just want to factor that into the
definitely. Yeah, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12911-0
02:32:31.156 --> 02:32:32.076
<v Marwan Altaie>Absolutely, yeah as well, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12928-0
02:32:34.396 --> 02:32:40.453
<v Marwan Altaie>So we've got Alex there March next year,
March next year finished.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12928-1
02:32:40.453 --> 02:32:45.516
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it finished March next year or is it
Alex three, no.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12936-0
02:32:47.476 --> 02:32:49.526
<v Marwan Altaie>What was the first?
What was what was being done in March</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12936-1
02:32:49.526 --> 02:32:50.516
<v Marwan Altaie>next year? I can't remember.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12940-0
02:32:51.876 --> 02:32:52.636
<v Marwan Altaie>I'll just do anything.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12993-0
02:32:54.196 --> 02:32:58.037
<v Marwan Altaie>So they're not when they finish all the
production changes just now,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12993-1
02:32:58.037 --> 02:33:01.543
<v Marwan Altaie>which is in their backlog so that they
can upgrade UAT to 3.1,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12993-2
02:33:01.543 --> 02:33:05.997
<v Marwan Altaie>which we'll take until last next year.
And then once they've done all the tests</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12993-3
02:33:05.997 --> 02:33:09.503
<v Marwan Altaie>and the new AAT etcetera,
they can sign off and move that into</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/12993-4
02:33:09.503 --> 02:33:10.116
<v Marwan Altaie>production.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13033-0
02:33:10.556 --> 02:33:14.100
<v Marwan Altaie>But I think the key thing he does,
that it goes back to the chat we had</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13033-1
02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:16.413
<v Marwan Altaie>earlier,
which is the sooner we get Lena stuff</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13033-2
02:33:16.413 --> 02:33:19.317
<v Marwan Altaie>site the stuff that you want to have a
conversation about,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13033-3
02:33:19.317 --> 02:33:22.369
<v Marwan Altaie>we don't want to wait until all there's a
new version of 3.1,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13033-4
02:33:22.369 --> 02:33:25.716
<v Marwan Altaie>we're going to front load that stuff.
We'll we'll have to know that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13033-5
02:33:25.716 --> 02:33:26.356
<v Marwan Altaie>conversation.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13041-0
02:33:26.556 --> 02:33:29.540
<v Marwan Altaie>Because they're not going to take out the
customization of that,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13041-1
02:33:29.540 --> 02:33:31.836
<v Marwan Altaie>what's going to come? Oh,
this is the thing, yes.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13051-0
02:33:33.356 --> 02:33:36.732
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, I mean, if that's,
if they're going to stop testing in unity</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13051-1
02:33:36.732 --> 02:33:38.396
<v Marwan Altaie>in March, have to assume that by.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13103-0
02:33:39.876 --> 02:33:42.473
<v Marwan Altaie>Like December,
they know what they're actually gonna</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13103-1
02:33:42.473 --> 02:33:45.266
<v Marwan Altaie>take out, what they don't.
Otherwise we are in. Oh, yes,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13103-2
02:33:45.266 --> 02:33:47.667
<v Marwan Altaie>I would hope. Anyway, that's a yeah,
absolutely.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13103-3
02:33:47.667 --> 02:33:50.068
<v Marwan Altaie>And I'm not gonna stand here and speak
for them.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13103-4
02:33:50.068 --> 02:33:53.939
<v Marwan Altaie>What I'm gonna do is take a question,
but there is that whole point of I would</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13103-5
02:33:53.939 --> 02:33:56.096
<v Marwan Altaie>quite like to have a conversation with
him.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13103-6
02:33:56.096 --> 02:33:59.036
<v Marwan Altaie>And I'd quite like to get the stuff from
your side as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13148-0
02:33:59.556 --> 02:34:03.321
<v Marwan Altaie>And then sort of do that, you know,
meshing them together because to,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13148-1
02:34:03.321 --> 02:34:06.011
<v Marwan Altaie>you know,
the point one thing we are going to try</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13148-2
02:34:06.011 --> 02:34:10.476
<v Marwan Altaie>and do is surface what future phases look
like and obviously that will then follow</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13148-3
02:34:10.476 --> 02:34:13.380
<v Marwan Altaie>into a well.
You can't get all of that stuff that you</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13148-4
02:34:13.380 --> 02:34:16.716
<v Marwan Altaie>might want to do in phase two,
which ones are the priorities?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13162-0
02:34:17.156 --> 02:34:20.098
<v Marwan Altaie>So if for example,
you've now got a gap in the three</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13162-1
02:34:20.098 --> 02:34:23.040
<v Marwan Altaie>capabilities,
we'd want to potentially shoot that up</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13162-2
02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:23.596
<v Marwan Altaie>the queue.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13180-0
02:34:26.476 --> 02:34:29.584
<v Marwan Altaie>But you only know about it if it's
written down and on a log and goes into</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13180-1
02:34:29.584 --> 02:34:31.076
<v Marwan Altaie>the steel Co and all the rest of it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13181-0
02:34:34.116 --> 02:34:34.156
<v Marwan Altaie>I.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13226-0
02:34:36.956 --> 02:34:39.373
<v Marwan Altaie>No, no,
it's it's still fine because the chances</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13226-1
02:34:39.373 --> 02:34:42.826
<v Marwan Altaie>of squeezing that in for September is
probably 0 anyway. So you know,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13226-2
02:34:42.826 --> 02:34:46.033
<v Marwan Altaie>I think we just, yeah,
you know everybody in the room knows that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13226-3
02:34:46.033 --> 02:34:49.881
<v Marwan Altaie>some of the stuff we're chatting about
now is not going to make the September</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13226-4
02:34:49.881 --> 02:34:51.756
<v Marwan Altaie>time frame. It might make a phase one.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13230-0
02:34:52.916 --> 02:34:54.796
<v Marwan Altaie>So yeah, January's fine.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13253-0
02:34:58.316 --> 02:35:03.036
<v Marwan Altaie>Well, one other process,
and this was Lynn's mic drop earlier,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13253-1
02:35:03.036 --> 02:35:08.505
<v Marwan Altaie>was the debtor whip certification.
It's a process that sits outside ask,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13253-2
02:35:08.505 --> 02:35:13.076
<v Marwan Altaie>but I get involved in the debt side of it.
So Steve as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13288-0
02:35:13.476 --> 02:35:17.088
<v Marwan Altaie>That side of it,
it's something that potentially will come</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13288-1
02:35:17.088 --> 02:35:21.987
<v Marwan Altaie>in to ask at some point. Just again,
I'm flagging it just for future reference,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13288-2
02:35:21.987 --> 02:35:25.845
<v Marwan Altaie>just if we discuss it now.
But they spoke with it like they've</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13288-3
02:35:25.845 --> 02:35:30.070
<v Marwan Altaie>gotten the basics of just something to
again to note for the record,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13288-4
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:31.356
<v Marwan Altaie>who owns it just now.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13313-0
02:35:33.996 --> 02:35:41.198
<v Marwan Altaie>Debatable part Australia finance managers
part so Nick Lewis and then part Rachel</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13313-1
02:35:41.198 --> 02:35:46.556
<v Marwan Altaie>McLean and David Curry. OK,
so I think that's acrb Isabella.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13361-0
02:35:47.356 --> 02:35:50.284
<v Marwan Altaie>That's a change request that we're going
to need to explore,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13361-1
02:35:50.284 --> 02:35:54.028
<v Marwan Altaie>so we'll need to start scoping that.
That was the date certification process,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13361-2
02:35:54.028 --> 02:35:56.236
<v Marwan Altaie>web certification date and web
certification.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13361-3
02:35:56.236 --> 02:35:59.884
<v Marwan Altaie>So if you can just take a note of that
and take it back to the team. Sorry,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13361-4
02:35:59.884 --> 02:36:03.244
<v Marwan Altaie>do you mind repeating that?
So the date and WEP certification process</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13361-5
02:36:03.244 --> 02:36:06.076
<v Marwan Altaie>is one that we talked about this morning
when Lynn was in.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13384-0
02:36:06.516 --> 02:36:09.955
<v Marwan Altaie>So it sits outside of us just now,
but there's an argument that it could</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13384-1
02:36:09.955 --> 02:36:13.818
<v Marwan Altaie>come in to ask and sit in credit control.
Can you just note that and make sure it</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13384-2
02:36:13.818 --> 02:36:17.116
<v Marwan Altaie>goes through change review and we'll
start doing the scoping? Thanks.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13385-0
02:36:20.196 --> 02:36:20.436
<v Marwan Altaie>Umm.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13391-0
02:36:21.916 --> 02:36:24.836
<v Marwan Altaie>Not sucking throne.
I can't think of anything.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13403-0
02:36:27.156 --> 02:36:30.516
<v Marwan Altaie>I think the key thing is just is there
anything else that's between our teams?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13430-0
02:36:31.716 --> 02:36:35.944
<v Marwan Altaie>From your perspective,
receive requests from credit control</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13430-1
02:36:35.944 --> 02:36:39.257
<v Marwan Altaie>receive requests from the business in
general,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13430-2
02:36:39.257 --> 02:36:42.639
<v Marwan Altaie>but they are generally random questions
ad hoc.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13430-3
02:36:42.639 --> 02:36:47.996
<v Marwan Altaie>So would you want a credit control
general inquiry type form on the portal?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13465-0
02:36:49.996 --> 02:36:53.235
<v Marwan Altaie>To be specific to client,
region collector and whatnot,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13465-1
02:36:53.235 --> 02:36:57.283
<v Marwan Altaie>sort of generic portal. What?
Because it would you would then need to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13465-2
02:36:57.283 --> 02:37:02.026
<v Marwan Altaie>signpost that to the relevant person. OK,
so if people are sending those requests</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13465-3
02:37:02.026 --> 02:37:06.422
<v Marwan Altaie>and just now are they sending them to
individuals or are they sending them,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13465-4
02:37:06.422 --> 02:37:07.116
<v Marwan Altaie>we are 999%.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13513-0
02:37:07.356 --> 02:37:10.043
<v Marwan Altaie>Visual mailbox as opposed to shared
mailboxes,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13513-1
02:37:10.043 --> 02:37:14.503
<v Marwan Altaie>so that's probably a wider question I
would put to you as around why are they</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13513-2
02:37:14.503 --> 02:37:17.419
<v Marwan Altaie>going through.
I know why they go through personal</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13513-3
02:37:17.419 --> 02:37:20.849
<v Marwan Altaie>mailboxes, right?
But bearing the mind for functionality we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13513-4
02:37:20.849 --> 02:37:25.366
<v Marwan Altaie>can have in service now is there a way
that we can start to think about how we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13513-5
02:37:25.366 --> 02:37:27.196
<v Marwan Altaie>move that from personal mailbox?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13549-0
02:37:27.236 --> 02:37:31.991
<v Marwan Altaie>Boxes to a shared service mailbox so that
we can start tracking that sort of stuff.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13549-1
02:37:31.991 --> 02:37:35.558
<v Marwan Altaie>The problem is that the relationship
between the client sorry,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13549-2
02:37:35.558 --> 02:37:40.030
<v Marwan Altaie>the partner and the controller and also
the client is specific to individuals.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13549-3
02:37:40.030 --> 02:37:44.276
<v Marwan Altaie>You would not want it to be a generic
service, you want it to be a tailor.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13554-0
02:37:44.756 --> 02:37:47.076
<v Marwan Altaie>One to one relationship because that's
how you get your money out.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13564-0
02:37:48.876 --> 02:37:52.883
<v Marwan Altaie>Operate so yes,
there is potential that you could put it</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13564-1
02:37:52.883 --> 02:37:53.516
<v Marwan Altaie>into a A.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13604-0
02:37:55.716 --> 02:37:58.970
<v Marwan Altaie>Larger, wider thing,
but you'd need to be very your e-mail</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13604-1
02:37:58.970 --> 02:38:01.893
<v Marwan Altaie>going out to someone has to be from that
individual.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13604-2
02:38:01.893 --> 02:38:05.368
<v Marwan Altaie>Your e-mail coming back has to be that it
hasn't personalised.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13604-3
02:38:05.368 --> 02:38:08.898
<v Marwan Altaie>If they said you don't box it,
you lose all your relationships,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13604-4
02:38:08.898 --> 02:38:11.436
<v Marwan Altaie>so that's maybe a wider question to
consider.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13645-0
02:38:11.956 --> 02:38:16.208
<v Marwan Altaie>How you could ServiceNow help us with
that because I totally agree,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13645-1
02:38:16.208 --> 02:38:19.335
<v Marwan Altaie>it still needs to stay as a personalised
service,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13645-2
02:38:19.335 --> 02:38:23.588
<v Marwan Altaie>but if we automate allocation we can
automate allocation on client.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13645-3
02:38:23.588 --> 02:38:28.716
<v Marwan Altaie>So who looks after particular clients,
which means we can get it in to ourselves.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13693-0
02:38:28.996 --> 02:38:32.644
<v Marwan Altaie>And get it to the right person,
and when they're corresponding,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13693-1
02:38:32.644 --> 02:38:36.350
<v Marwan Altaie>they can correspond that way.
But I don't know how we do that if</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13693-2
02:38:36.350 --> 02:38:41.025
<v Marwan Altaie>they're emailing personal people's e-mail
addresses rather than a shared service,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13693-3
02:38:41.025 --> 02:38:43.932
<v Marwan Altaie>so it's maybe just a question mark to
think about.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13693-4
02:38:43.932 --> 02:38:47.467
<v Marwan Altaie>We might not be able to write,
or it might be too cumbersome,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13693-5
02:38:47.467 --> 02:38:48.436
<v Marwan Altaie>or we might need.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13725-0
02:38:48.596 --> 02:38:53.249
<v Marwan Altaie>Change the relationship, but assignments.
It's not necessarily a one to one</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13725-1
02:38:53.249 --> 02:38:56.250
<v Marwan Altaie>relationship,
so Stephen deals with partner 123.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13725-2
02:38:56.250 --> 02:38:59.372
<v Marwan Altaie>However, if it is client XY or Z,
it goes to this.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13725-3
02:38:59.372 --> 02:39:03.965
<v Marwan Altaie>So there are conflicting assignments.
So just you have to have a hierarchy</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13725-4
02:39:03.965 --> 02:39:04.516
<v Marwan Altaie>based on.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13726-0
02:39:05.196 --> 02:39:05.436
<v Marwan Altaie>Umm.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13764-0
02:39:07.156 --> 02:39:11.265
<v Marwan Altaie>Client a matter client partner and I
think as long as there's a matrix for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13764-1
02:39:11.265 --> 02:39:15.921
<v Marwan Altaie>that, the system's capable of doing that,
it's definitely capable of doing it. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13764-2
02:39:15.921 --> 02:39:20.140
<v Marwan Altaie>it's definitely capable of doing it.
It is custom because ServiceNow doesn't</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13764-3
02:39:20.140 --> 02:39:23.756
<v Marwan Altaie>account for the kind of client matter and
partner hierarchy. But.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13793-0
02:39:24.316 --> 02:39:29.020
<v Marwan Altaie>It definitely can be done.
We can take you as an action to review it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13793-1
02:39:29.020 --> 02:39:34.263
<v Marwan Altaie>The other thing I was also going to say
is there's a need to maintain that as</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13793-2
02:39:34.263 --> 02:39:38.766
<v Marwan Altaie>well. So as you bring on new clients,
new masses or XP ages, yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13793-3
02:39:38.766 --> 02:39:42.396
<v Marwan Altaie>it's a nightmare of thousands and
thousands of lines.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13797-0
02:39:42.956 --> 02:39:44.756
<v Marwan Altaie>Data to make sure that you're not
confident.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13826-0
02:39:45.916 --> 02:39:49.808
<v Marwan Altaie>System has to tell you if you put
something in it conflicts with other.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13826-1
02:39:49.808 --> 02:39:53.754
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, yeah, it's it's we'll take away.
We can have a look at that. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13825-0
02:39:53.556 --> 02:39:56.676
<v Parik Narain>Yeah. And Julian also differs.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13826-2
02:39:53.754 --> 02:39:55.916
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't think the size of the teams are.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13833-0
02:39:57.756 --> 02:39:58.516
<v Marwan Altaie>Big are they?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13832-0
02:39:57.996 --> 02:39:59.076
<v Parik Narain>This is also a change.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13872-0
02:40:02.076 --> 02:40:04.018
<v Parik Narain>Sorry,
I was about to say apologise if I</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13841-0
02:40:02.596 --> 02:40:03.036
<v Marwan Altaie>Compose.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13872-1
02:40:04.018 --> 02:40:07.570
<v Parik Narain>interrupt someone I was about to say.
It's also it's it's a massive change</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13872-2
02:40:07.570 --> 02:40:11.170
<v Parik Narain>effort as well because I'm sure client
partners have a way to deal with the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13872-3
02:40:11.170 --> 02:40:14.817
<v Parik Narain>clients as you're saying in their own way.
So moving them into a centralised</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13872-4
02:40:14.817 --> 02:40:16.996
<v Parik Narain>platform might need a lot of what do you
say?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13895-0
02:40:18.956 --> 02:40:22.135
<v Parik Narain>Just just a business case for them to
actually move out of their personal</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13895-1
02:40:22.135 --> 02:40:25.185
<v Parik Narain>emails onto a centralised platform,
so it's much more than a technical</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13895-2
02:40:25.185 --> 02:40:25.916
<v Parik Narain>question I think.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13928-0
02:40:27.156 --> 02:40:29.818
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah,
I think there's quite a lot to consider</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13928-1
02:40:29.818 --> 02:40:32.307
<v Marwan Altaie>in it.
I think it's just something that we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13928-2
02:40:32.307 --> 02:40:36.126
<v Marwan Altaie>should ask the question around and if
it's massive customization,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13928-3
02:40:36.126 --> 02:40:40.988
<v Marwan Altaie>then that's even a wider question, right.
And we might not even be able to do that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13928-4
02:40:40.988 --> 02:40:42.956
<v Marwan Altaie>But I think from a perspective of.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13953-0
02:40:43.676 --> 02:40:48.148
<v Marwan Altaie>How we manage all the stuff from an ask
perspective and how people request things</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13953-1
02:40:48.148 --> 02:40:51.039
<v Marwan Altaie>through us from ask,
it's worth asking the question,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13953-2
02:40:51.039 --> 02:40:55.076
<v Marwan Altaie>but I don't know what level of
customization would be involved. Etcetera.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13964-0
02:40:57.676 --> 02:41:00.120
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, I was. I was just just saying,
I mean,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13964-1
02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:02.076
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't think the size of the teams.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13973-0
02:41:04.036 --> 02:41:10.956
<v Marwan Altaie>Are big enough to condone that effort to
to make the.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13987-0
02:41:13.476 --> 02:41:18.549
<v Marwan Altaie>To make the assignments automatic,
I think what you say there's eight of you.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13987-1
02:41:18.549 --> 02:41:20.436
<v Marwan Altaie>Did I hear earlier? 8 of you?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13994-0
02:41:21.836 --> 02:41:26.084
<v Marwan Altaie>I said Glasgow. Yeah,
we've got another seven in Glasgow,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/13994-1
02:41:26.084 --> 02:41:27.036
<v Marwan Altaie>plus another.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14000-0
02:41:29.556 --> 02:41:32.996
<v Marwan Altaie>It's about 2530 globally, roughly.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14005-0
02:41:35.716 --> 02:41:40.316
<v Marwan Altaie>Right. OK. Yeah. Yeah. OK. OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14048-0
02:41:44.396 --> 02:41:46.974
<v Marwan Altaie>No. Again, I think it's one of those.
We captured it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14048-1
02:41:46.974 --> 02:41:50.842
<v Marwan Altaie>It goes up for assessment and approval.
The customization mod is always going to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14048-2
02:41:50.842 --> 02:41:53.420
<v Marwan Altaie>raise a red flag.
But does it mean long term is there</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14048-3
02:41:53.420 --> 02:41:55.712
<v Marwan Altaie>another place it can go? You know,
for example,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14048-4
02:41:55.712 --> 02:41:59.437
<v Marwan Altaie>you've just said if you're having to
maintain it in VE and it's a pain in the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14048-5
02:41:59.437 --> 02:41:59.676
<v Marwan Altaie>arms.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14079-0
02:42:00.436 --> 02:42:04.429
<v Marwan Altaie>Do you can you move it to can you know,
can you do easier, simpler,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14079-1
02:42:04.429 --> 02:42:08.364
<v Marwan Altaie>NCE and then it flushes through to
service now and it can edit it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14079-2
02:42:08.364 --> 02:42:12.417
<v Marwan Altaie>But all of that stuff is, you know,
further down the road and. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14079-3
02:42:12.417 --> 02:42:15.236
<v Marwan Altaie>but again,
we absolutely want to know about it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14088-0
02:42:16.316 --> 02:42:19.982
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. Yeah, we definitely don't want the.
Oh, we should've mentioned this.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14088-1
02:42:19.982 --> 02:42:23.405
<v Marwan Altaie>Got the shopping list. Now,
I think everybody else will say should be</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14088-2
02:42:23.405 --> 02:42:23.796
<v Marwan Altaie>on site.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14119-0
02:42:29.676 --> 02:42:33.223
<v Marwan Altaie>I just want to ask for the certification
process.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14119-1
02:42:33.223 --> 02:42:39.182
<v Marwan Altaie>Do you have like a deadline you'd want to
spy to help you with the whole process or</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14119-2
02:42:39.182 --> 02:42:44.716
<v Marwan Altaie>just, you know, thinking about, you know,
for the CRB and how to plan for it?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14139-0
02:42:46.836 --> 02:42:50.291
<v Marwan Altaie>If it matters,
or how closely related is it from a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14139-1
02:42:50.291 --> 02:42:55.236
<v Marwan Altaie>change perspective to the other ones,
we're going to put on service now.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14145-0
02:42:57.236 --> 02:42:59.436
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm just thinking if we're having a
change.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14156-0
02:43:01.036 --> 02:43:03.553
<v Marwan Altaie>OK,
so there probably isn't a deadline then.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14156-1
02:43:03.553 --> 02:43:08.196
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, be like this, but yeah, it's done. OK,
six months. It's done every six months.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14190-0
02:43:10.476 --> 02:43:13.412
<v Marwan Altaie>So regular. OK,
I think it would be advantageous to be</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14190-1
02:43:13.412 --> 02:43:17.522
<v Marwan Altaie>able to bucket into this purely from the
change perspective because we'll be</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14190-2
02:43:17.522 --> 02:43:21.633
<v Marwan Altaie>having those change conversations anyway.
But it's got a real this one's got</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14190-3
02:43:21.633 --> 02:43:24.836
<v Marwan Altaie>particularly business win because there
are a lot of, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14220-0
02:43:26.196 --> 02:43:28.900
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah,
this is one of the reasons I'd like to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14220-1
02:43:28.900 --> 02:43:33.526
<v Marwan Altaie>bring it into Oscars. We control it,
control it. Yeah. We save so much time,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14220-2
02:43:33.526 --> 02:43:36.290
<v Marwan Altaie>guys, but it's probably work. Yeah. Yeah.
OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14220-3
02:43:36.290 --> 02:43:40.196
<v Marwan Altaie>The finance manager in Australia would
not have an issue either.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14240-0
02:43:40.836 --> 02:43:45.039
<v Marwan Altaie>With any changes to the process, yeah.
Or even in any kind of automation that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14240-1
02:43:45.039 --> 02:43:47.680
<v Marwan Altaie>would make her life easier.
And her teen's life,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14240-2
02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:51.076
<v Marwan Altaie>she would have no problem with it,
you know, so that is a win.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14246-0
02:43:52.636 --> 02:43:54.756
<v Marwan Altaie>Definitely UK finance team.
I just agree with.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14249-0
02:43:56.796 --> 02:43:59.556
<v Marwan Altaie>And I've also said it before. Look,
that's.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14250-0
02:44:01.396 --> 02:44:01.516
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14253-0
02:44:03.716 --> 02:44:04.476
<v Marwan Altaie>Leave that with you, Jill.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14295-0
02:44:08.756 --> 02:44:11.859
<v Marwan Altaie>So I've made a note of the credit control
general inquiries.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14295-1
02:44:11.859 --> 02:44:15.981
<v Marwan Altaie>I think you've taken away as parking lot
item. So we'll pick that up afterwards.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14295-2
02:44:15.981 --> 02:44:18.779
<v Marwan Altaie>But I understand the emphasis is that
personalization,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14295-3
02:44:18.779 --> 02:44:22.596
<v Marwan Altaie>otherwise you're not getting your
business or your clients, so that, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14297-0
02:44:23.116 --> 02:44:23.876
<v Marwan Altaie>We'll account for that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14331-0
02:44:26.996 --> 02:44:30.786
<v Marwan Altaie>Some of these I'm just going to ignore
the finance OPS trust.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14331-1
02:44:30.786 --> 02:44:35.737
<v Marwan Altaie>I thought there might be a segregation,
but I'll update this afterwards based on</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14331-2
02:44:35.737 --> 02:44:39.344
<v Marwan Altaie>our discussions,
but I want to get in as much as possible.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14331-3
02:44:39.344 --> 02:44:42.156
<v Marwan Altaie>That's useful to us.
So this is just summary.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14370-0
02:44:42.716 --> 02:44:47.448
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm going to breeze past trust processes.
I think we've gotten into and discussed</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14370-1
02:44:47.448 --> 02:44:50.334
<v Marwan Altaie>kind of logic.
Some of it's with potentially cash</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14370-2
02:44:50.334 --> 02:44:54.143
<v Marwan Altaie>sharing processes as well.
So it's just understanding where those</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14370-3
02:44:54.143 --> 02:44:58.876
<v Marwan Altaie>end to end points are and what nuances we
want, which we'll take away after this.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14418-0
02:44:59.556 --> 02:45:02.681
<v Marwan Altaie>And by the way,
if anyone has any questions on these</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14418-1
02:45:02.681 --> 02:45:06.926
<v Marwan Altaie>slides, feel free to jump in.
I'm just trying to get through as much as</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14418-2
02:45:06.926 --> 02:45:10.581
<v Marwan Altaie>possible without overrunning,
so this is the thresholds I was</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14418-3
02:45:10.581 --> 02:45:13.470
<v Marwan Altaie>discussing earlier that we have slides
for them.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14418-4
02:45:13.470 --> 02:45:17.539
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm aware it's probably difficult to get
this information right now,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14418-5
02:45:17.539 --> 02:45:18.836
<v Marwan Altaie>so after this session.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14455-0
02:45:19.156 --> 02:45:21.785
<v Marwan Altaie>And I can ping out what I need from you
guys.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14455-1
02:45:21.785 --> 02:45:26.358
<v Marwan Altaie>But ultimately if we have thresholds for
refunds, write offs and payment terms,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14455-2
02:45:26.358 --> 02:45:29.788
<v Marwan Altaie>and potentially even for the FX variances,
be good to know.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14455-3
02:45:29.788 --> 02:45:34.533
<v Marwan Altaie>So then we can put it into our workflows
and then route it to the correct decision</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14455-4
02:45:34.533 --> 02:45:35.276
<v Marwan Altaie>makers, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14479-0
02:45:36.876 --> 02:45:40.007
<v Marwan Altaie>Hopefully everyone's good on the
threshold side of things. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14479-1
02:45:40.007 --> 02:45:44.053
<v Marwan Altaie>I won't spend too much time on that again,
this is just kind of an open discussion,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14479-2
02:45:44.053 --> 02:45:48.196
<v Marwan Altaie>but I think we've gotten into enough debt,
debt, enough detail, threshold, something.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14481-0
02:45:53.916 --> 02:45:54.956
<v Marwan Altaie>Or useless.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14489-0
02:45:56.716 --> 02:46:00.356
<v Marwan Altaie>I've sat on the Internet somewhere and
I'd get heads come by going to there.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14499-0
02:46:03.636 --> 02:46:06.876
<v Marwan Altaie>Going to be doing this change because
it's probably good opportunity to make.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14518-0
02:46:17.796 --> 02:46:20.482
<v Marwan Altaie>So do you mean that people aren't clear
on their,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14518-1
02:46:20.482 --> 02:46:24.243
<v Marwan Altaie>like roles and responsibilities when it
comes to thresholds? So what?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14518-2
02:46:24.243 --> 02:46:26.876
<v Marwan Altaie>Some people don't know. First of all,
who could?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14529-0
02:46:28.516 --> 02:46:31.676
<v Marwan Altaie>Quite a business there also some of the
approvals don't know what they.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14539-0
02:46:33.276 --> 02:46:38.796
<v Marwan Altaie>We should be. So how do you manage that?
How do you manage that currently?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14558-0
02:46:41.036 --> 02:46:45.393
<v Marwan Altaie>Oh, OK. It's something we should.
It's a very simple thing to communicate</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14558-1
02:46:45.393 --> 02:46:49.575
<v Marwan Altaie>out. This is the this is the rules.
This is the amounts. There you go.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14558-2
02:46:49.575 --> 02:46:51.636
<v Marwan Altaie>So it is on the intranet somewhere.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14610-0
02:46:54.436 --> 02:46:59.018
<v Marwan Altaie>I think we can maybe do something around
that from the knowledge perspective as</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14610-1
02:46:59.018 --> 02:47:01.653
<v Marwan Altaie>well.
Link to that Internet page and then the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14610-2
02:47:01.653 --> 02:47:06.236
<v Marwan Altaie>discussion is probably just about where
we allow them to go in and find that or</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14610-3
02:47:06.236 --> 02:47:09.788
<v Marwan Altaie>we push it to them in certain situations
if that's necessary.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14610-4
02:47:09.788 --> 02:47:12.996
<v Marwan Altaie>But if we're going to build matrices and
on thresholds.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14617-0
02:47:13.476 --> 02:47:17.796
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm not sure. I don't know,
just something to something else, right?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14667-0
02:47:21.036 --> 02:47:23.782
<v Marwan Altaie>Also to caveat,
you don't necessarily need the thresholds</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14667-1
02:47:23.782 --> 02:47:26.244
<v Marwan Altaie>in there,
it just makes the automation and workflow</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14667-2
02:47:26.244 --> 02:47:28.612
<v Marwan Altaie>more efficient.
But if you get a lot of pushback,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14667-3
02:47:28.612 --> 02:47:31.548
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll accommodate. Of course,
why is this coming to me? Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14667-4
02:47:31.548 --> 02:47:35.241
<v Marwan Altaie>I get why you studying to me proposed
solution. I've gone through high level.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14667-5
02:47:35.241 --> 02:47:38.556
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't want to spend too much time on
this, but is everyone kind of?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14706-0
02:47:38.876 --> 02:47:42.662
<v Marwan Altaie>On boards with this is the right
direction, form ticketing,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14706-1
02:47:42.662 --> 02:47:47.395
<v Marwan Altaie>routing and then decision making within
the system. Yeah, I think there's,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14706-2
02:47:47.395 --> 02:47:51.244
<v Marwan Altaie>I think I am the one bit I'm not,
I'm a bit uncertain about.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14706-3
02:47:51.244 --> 02:47:53.516
<v Marwan Altaie>I think I'm still convincing is the.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14711-0
02:47:55.036 --> 02:47:57.116
<v Marwan Altaie>Just the general allocation.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14737-0
02:47:59.236 --> 02:48:02.414
<v Marwan Altaie>That we are making it too complicated.
I think the rest of it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14737-1
02:48:02.414 --> 02:48:05.339
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm OK with the general allocation.
Here's your 10 items.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14737-2
02:48:05.339 --> 02:48:08.618
<v Marwan Altaie>How do I do it that bit?
I'm a bit concerned that we're actually</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14737-3
02:48:08.618 --> 02:48:09.476
<v Marwan Altaie>making it longer.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14794-0
02:48:11.316 --> 02:48:14.659
<v Marwan Altaie>I just want once we have,
but I think I think once I maybe have</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14794-1
02:48:14.659 --> 02:48:17.480
<v Marwan Altaie>read it more.
And so I was gonna say once we have our</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14794-2
02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:20.457
<v Marwan Altaie>follow-ups this this isn't the final list.
Like we said,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14794-3
02:48:20.457 --> 02:48:24.793
<v Marwan Altaie>if it's adding more admin we exclude it.
But we have a few cases like the bad debt</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14794-4
02:48:24.793 --> 02:48:28.868
<v Marwan Altaie>write off. It's a easy case to throw in.
So not an issue if you don't want to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14794-5
02:48:28.868 --> 02:48:29.756
<v Marwan Altaie>include it, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14821-0
02:48:30.476 --> 02:48:32.970
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, yeah,
I think it's just a question mark.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14821-1
02:48:32.970 --> 02:48:37.215
<v Marwan Altaie>And we just need to understand a little
bit more about how it happens currently</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14821-2
02:48:37.215 --> 02:48:41.301
<v Marwan Altaie>so that we can see how exactly. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Absolutely not against it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14821-3
02:48:41.301 --> 02:48:44.432
<v Marwan Altaie>Just want to make sure that is worth
doing something cool.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14821-4
02:48:44.432 --> 02:48:46.396
<v Marwan Altaie>I'll breeze through this, the states.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14864-0
02:48:47.236 --> 02:48:49.476
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't know if that's worth discussing
now.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14864-1
02:48:49.476 --> 02:48:52.414
<v Marwan Altaie>This was just a high level what I'm
suggesting. But again,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14864-2
02:48:52.414 --> 02:48:56.099
<v Marwan Altaie>once we have a bit more information on
allocations and where we're going,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14864-3
02:48:56.099 --> 02:48:58.490
<v Marwan Altaie>we can then use the drive.
But at a high level,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14864-4
02:48:58.490 --> 02:49:02.324
<v Marwan Altaie>we want relatively standardised states
across the different aspects and that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14864-5
02:49:02.324 --> 02:49:04.316
<v Marwan Altaie>makes reporting and dashboards and also.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14903-0
02:49:04.796 --> 02:49:07.963
<v Marwan Altaie>Like into team processes or cross
departmental processes,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14903-1
02:49:07.963 --> 02:49:11.568
<v Marwan Altaie>a lot easier to follow and see where
everything's at. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14903-2
02:49:11.568 --> 02:49:15.773
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm just gonna go back to what I always
say when I see the world's automated</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14903-3
02:49:15.773 --> 02:49:20.142
<v Marwan Altaie>approvals and workflows and everything
else we need to trust the data that's in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14903-4
02:49:20.142 --> 02:49:22.436
<v Marwan Altaie>place. Yeah, before we would turn that on.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14950-0
02:49:23.996 --> 02:49:29.445
<v Marwan Altaie>Simply because of the fact that if we're
using GDHGDHVGD and you know all that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14950-1
02:49:29.445 --> 02:49:34.895
<v Marwan Altaie>other good stuff and it has again gone
back to sensitivity and all the rest of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14950-2
02:49:34.895 --> 02:49:37.861
<v Marwan Altaie>it,
but it's great to say that we could do</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14950-3
02:49:37.861 --> 02:49:42.276
<v Marwan Altaie>that. But the question will be,
should we do that based on the?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14953-0
02:49:42.516 --> 02:49:44.330
<v Marwan Altaie>The gap,
the knowledge gaps and the gaps that we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14953-1
02:49:44.330 --> 02:49:44.516
<v Marwan Altaie>have.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14954-0
02:49:48.516 --> 02:49:48.636
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14996-0
02:49:51.956 --> 02:49:56.955
<v Marwan Altaie>I was just going to say on this part,
I think the actual states that we need</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14996-1
02:49:56.955 --> 02:50:02.150
<v Marwan Altaie>will probably be determined once we do
that into NPS because they'll need to be</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14996-2
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:07.149
<v Marwan Altaie>shareable. Yeah. Is that the right way?
There's going to have to be a global</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/14996-3
02:50:07.149 --> 02:50:10.396
<v Marwan Altaie>standard across finance,
but there's going to be.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15022-0
02:50:10.956 --> 02:50:12.938
<v Marwan Altaie>Maybe certain nuances for certain
processes,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15022-1
02:50:12.938 --> 02:50:15.229
<v Marwan Altaie>maybe also particularly in kind of credit
controls.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15022-2
02:50:15.229 --> 02:50:18.577
<v Marwan Altaie>Whether or whip that are specific.
So we just need to have global standard.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15022-3
02:50:18.577 --> 02:50:20.516
<v Marwan Altaie>But there's an offshoot for certain
pieces.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15055-0
02:50:22.156 --> 02:50:25.546
<v Marwan Altaie>I agree.
So I'm just going to go past this.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15055-1
02:50:25.546 --> 02:50:30.632
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't think form decision making.
This was just our high level,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15055-2
02:50:30.632 --> 02:50:36.874
<v Marwan Altaie>but I don't think that's relevant at the
moment. So I'm going to skip past this.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15055-3
02:50:36.874 --> 02:50:37.876
<v Marwan Altaie>This is just.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15099-0
02:50:38.236 --> 02:50:42.496
<v Marwan Altaie>An idea of what dashboards we could
potentially start putting in place with</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15099-1
02:50:42.496 --> 02:50:45.803
<v Marwan Altaie>the different teams.
Because ServiceNow is quite flexible,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15099-2
02:50:45.803 --> 02:50:50.511
<v Marwan Altaie>you have a lot of kind of configurability
when it comes to different dashboards and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15099-3
02:50:50.511 --> 02:50:53.930
<v Marwan Altaie>what you want to view.
So this is just my high level view of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15099-4
02:50:53.930 --> 02:50:55.556
<v Marwan Altaie>what could be beneficial but.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15140-0
02:50:56.196 --> 02:51:01.136
<v Marwan Altaie>You could have more. You could have less.
You could have more nuance specifically</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15140-1
02:51:01.136 --> 02:51:05.353
<v Marwan Altaie>for Australia if you wanted or if you
wanted a more overarching view,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15140-2
02:51:05.353 --> 02:51:09.571
<v Marwan Altaie>you could have. Where is it, general,
anything awaiting for approval?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15140-3
02:51:09.571 --> 02:51:14.210
<v Marwan Altaie>Anything that's missing information or
you could go down into specifics like</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15140-4
02:51:14.210 --> 02:51:15.596
<v Marwan Altaie>ageing or by threshold.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15179-0
02:51:15.916 --> 02:51:19.792
<v Marwan Altaie>Or if it's missing specific references,
we said a lot of them don't need evidence,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15179-1
02:51:19.792 --> 02:51:22.595
<v Marwan Altaie>so that might not be necessary,
but we can identify fields,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15179-2
02:51:22.595 --> 02:51:26.331
<v Marwan Altaie>create dashboards around those fields,
and then configure it based on the team.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15179-3
02:51:26.331 --> 02:51:29.367
<v Marwan Altaie>So if you're not restricted something,
we need to be careful of.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15179-4
02:51:29.367 --> 02:51:31.516
<v Marwan Altaie>This is just a probably a more general
point.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15182-0
02:51:32.596 --> 02:51:33.996
<v Marwan Altaie>To make this is user friendly.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15183-0
02:51:36.156 --> 02:51:36.436
<v Marwan Altaie>Umm.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15185-0
02:51:37.516 --> 02:51:38.676
<v Marwan Altaie>So OK.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15186-0
02:51:40.316 --> 02:51:40.836
<v Marwan Altaie>Questions and.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15188-0
02:51:42.836 --> 02:51:43.516
<v Marwan Altaie>Stop the Yup.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15231-0
02:51:48.356 --> 02:51:52.268
<v Marwan Altaie>They tend to lack common sense with you,
so you actually need to put it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15231-1
02:51:52.268 --> 02:51:55.805
<v Marwan Altaie>Make it really simple for them to access
any request. And I mean,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15231-2
02:51:55.805 --> 02:51:59.985
<v Marwan Altaie>if something's like cashiering and you
put it in control, they won't find it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15231-3
02:51:59.985 --> 02:52:02.772
<v Marwan Altaie>They'll just.
That's just something to think about.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15231-4
02:52:02.772 --> 02:52:04.916
<v Marwan Altaie>Really. It's a it's a really good point.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15272-0
02:52:05.716 --> 02:52:11.064
<v Marwan Altaie>Users who are maybe not understand how
processes work or what team sits with</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15272-1
02:52:11.064 --> 02:52:14.398
<v Marwan Altaie>what they need,
like kind of a a dummies guide.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15272-2
02:52:14.398 --> 02:52:20.024
<v Marwan Altaie>If you're used to someone else doing a
lot of this stuff for the put themselves,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15272-3
02:52:20.024 --> 02:52:24.956
<v Marwan Altaie>I think it's a it's a wider enterprise
question for the whole project.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15305-0
02:52:25.156 --> 02:52:29.732
<v Marwan Altaie>Team because ultimately the portal should
not be department driven.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15305-1
02:52:29.732 --> 02:52:33.029
<v Marwan Altaie>The portal is about your service and what
is it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15305-2
02:52:33.029 --> 02:52:38.480
<v Marwan Altaie>So if you imagine the actual front door
portal will be something along the lines</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15305-3
02:52:38.480 --> 02:52:40.836
<v Marwan Altaie>of I need to ask you for something.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15349-0
02:52:41.316 --> 02:52:45.464
<v Marwan Altaie>I've got a problem with something and I
need some information type things and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15349-1
02:52:45.464 --> 02:52:49.825
<v Marwan Altaie>then it will drill down under that within
what we're saying 3 clicks that we want</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15349-2
02:52:49.825 --> 02:52:53.335
<v Marwan Altaie>to get to certain things,
so we shouldn't really be in a position</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15349-3
02:52:53.335 --> 02:52:57.537
<v Marwan Altaie>where somebody as a requester is having
to decide is that credit control or is</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15349-4
02:52:57.537 --> 02:53:00.196
<v Marwan Altaie>that cashier than it shouldn't even be
like that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15399-0
02:53:00.956 --> 02:53:04.124
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's one of the way.
There are things that the projects are</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15399-1
02:53:04.124 --> 02:53:08.247
<v Marwan Altaie>tasked with in terms of how we make it
really easy. And within that three clicks,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15399-2
02:53:08.247 --> 02:53:11.516
<v Marwan Altaie>it's like a design principle that's been
set up for the project.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15399-3
02:53:11.516 --> 02:53:15.388
<v Marwan Altaie>So we will have a follow up session to
get into more detail for this kind of</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15399-4
02:53:15.388 --> 02:53:17.751
<v Marwan Altaie>stuff,
but it's just to start the conversation</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15399-5
02:53:17.751 --> 02:53:20.316
<v Marwan Altaie>and if you have ideas,
you'll come back to us and.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15402-0
02:53:20.396 --> 02:53:22.556
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, but but I agree, simple is better.
Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15423-0
02:53:26.076 --> 02:53:29.061
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, every single one. Yeah.
Kind of want to pick your pick your</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15423-1
02:53:29.061 --> 02:53:32.769
<v Marwan Altaie>problem. Lawyers from around the world,
them and say how what do you need to work</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15423-2
02:53:32.769 --> 02:53:34.759
<v Marwan Altaie>it out? Test this for us.
Just let us know.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15423-3
02:53:34.759 --> 02:53:36.116
<v Marwan Altaie>Make sure you be just special.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15467-0
02:53:39.876 --> 02:53:42.606
<v Marwan Altaie>This is just a reference for the
different types of Slas,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15467-1
02:53:42.606 --> 02:53:46.042
<v Marwan Altaie>Olas and underpinning contracts.
Just good to know for when you do start</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15467-2
02:53:46.042 --> 02:53:48.773
<v Marwan Altaie>structuring it.
We don't have anything at the moment from</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15467-3
02:53:48.773 --> 02:53:51.409
<v Marwan Altaie>the sound of things,
but when you do get to that point,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15467-4
02:53:51.409 --> 02:53:54.516
<v Marwan Altaie>these are good concepts to kind of use it
to drive those metrics.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15494-0
02:53:55.996 --> 02:53:59.067
<v Marwan Altaie>And that's another thing that we'll
probably support on from an ask</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15494-1
02:53:59.067 --> 02:54:02.726
<v Marwan Altaie>perspective around how we work through
that and then come out and get the detail</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15494-2
02:54:02.726 --> 02:54:05.301
<v Marwan Altaie>from each team.
Can I ask why would we have a difference</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15494-3
02:54:05.301 --> 02:54:06.476
<v Marwan Altaie>between an Ola and an SLA?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15536-0
02:54:09.316 --> 02:54:12.912
<v Marwan Altaie>So particularly from the Ola perspectives,
typically more for the internal</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15536-1
02:54:12.912 --> 02:54:15.213
<v Marwan Altaie>measurement.
So if I'm handing off a particular</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15536-2
02:54:15.213 --> 02:54:18.282
<v Marwan Altaie>process to say it's coming from
cashiering into credit control,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15536-3
02:54:18.282 --> 02:54:20.824
<v Marwan Altaie>for example,
there's an agreement between you that I</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15536-4
02:54:20.824 --> 02:54:24.516
<v Marwan Altaie>will respond within a certain amount of
time to fulfil a particular service.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15587-0
02:54:25.036 --> 02:54:28.014
<v Marwan Altaie>With the SLA that's with the business
there. So for the business,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15587-1
02:54:28.014 --> 02:54:30.902
<v Marwan Altaie>they just see it as I hand it off,
it goes and says black hole,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15587-2
02:54:30.902 --> 02:54:34.558
<v Marwan Altaie>it should be fulfilled by whichever how
amend the number of teams and you should</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15587-3
02:54:34.558 --> 02:54:38.123
<v Marwan Altaie>be able to respond back and fulfil the
outcome within a certain amount of time</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15587-4
02:54:38.123 --> 02:54:40.334
<v Marwan Altaie>as well.
So that's the what we are agreeing with</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15587-5
02:54:40.334 --> 02:54:42.636
<v Marwan Altaie>the business in which we will fulfil that
service.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15609-0
02:54:42.916 --> 02:54:45.300
<v Marwan Altaie>End to end fully by a certain amount of
time as well,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15609-1
02:54:45.300 --> 02:54:48.878
<v Marwan Altaie>so we can then measure how well do we do
with the business and actually where is</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15609-2
02:54:48.878 --> 02:54:51.130
<v Marwan Altaie>it that we can improve internally within
the team.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15609-3
02:54:51.130 --> 02:54:52.676
<v Marwan Altaie>So that's help us to differentiate.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15660-0
02:54:56.276 --> 02:54:58.930
<v Marwan Altaie>And again,
just some suggestions and to get you</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15660-1
02:54:58.930 --> 02:55:03.023
<v Marwan Altaie>thinking about Slas and overlays and what
stuff we could have or metrics.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15660-2
02:55:03.023 --> 02:55:07.227
<v Marwan Altaie>So first controller, credit control,
review, decision making, cash sharing,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15660-3
02:55:07.227 --> 02:55:10.987
<v Marwan Altaie>actually actioning at the end of it and
then approval or rejection,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15660-4
02:55:10.987 --> 02:55:14.804
<v Marwan Altaie>if you want a really simple high level
and that's exactly it, right.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15660-5
02:55:14.804 --> 02:55:16.076
<v Marwan Altaie>It's as simple as that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15693-0
02:55:16.156 --> 02:55:19.341
<v Marwan Altaie>That when you look at the Ole,
I can't even speak.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15693-1
02:55:19.341 --> 02:55:23.277
<v Marwan Altaie>I've had loads of sugar as well.
Answer what's wrong with Ole?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15693-2
02:55:23.277 --> 02:55:27.399
<v Marwan Altaie>You might have a workflow that has four
different elements in it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15693-3
02:55:27.399 --> 02:55:30.397
<v Marwan Altaie>Each one of those elements might take 24
hours.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15693-4
02:55:30.397 --> 02:55:33.396
<v Marwan Altaie>So you would technically say your SLA
would be.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15699-0
02:55:34.036 --> 02:55:36.956
<v Marwan Altaie>Four days, right.
That's how we'll work it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15734-0
02:55:39.076 --> 02:55:41.489
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.
And this is a list of reports that I</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15734-1
02:55:41.489 --> 02:55:45.079
<v Marwan Altaie>thought was just worth discussing very
briefly. Like I said,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15734-2
02:55:45.079 --> 02:55:49.317
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll have a separate session,
but especially for the change management</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15734-3
02:55:49.317 --> 02:55:51.907
<v Marwan Altaie>piece,
a lot of your partners will just one</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15734-4
02:55:51.907 --> 02:55:54.556
<v Marwan Altaie>really simple reports where everything
acts.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15764-0
02:55:55.876 --> 02:56:01.204
<v Marwan Altaie>And these are some that we can structure.
So work in progress items waiting for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15764-1
02:56:01.204 --> 02:56:04.268
<v Marwan Altaie>approval,
ready for posting trust refunds and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15764-2
02:56:04.268 --> 02:56:08.064
<v Marwan Altaie>transfers in progress,
evidence missing to close refund,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15764-3
02:56:08.064 --> 02:56:10.396
<v Marwan Altaie>timeliness and outcome summary and.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15813-0
02:56:10.836 --> 02:56:13.605
<v Marwan Altaie>It might also cross with some of the
cashiering processes,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15813-1
02:56:13.605 --> 02:56:16.327
<v Marwan Altaie>so you might not even need some of these
reports in here,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15813-2
02:56:16.327 --> 02:56:18.674
<v Marwan Altaie>but ultimately what you want to get to is
simple,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15813-3
02:56:18.674 --> 02:56:22.476
<v Marwan Altaie>concise reports that you could generate
or have specific dashboards or locations</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15813-4
02:56:22.476 --> 02:56:24.682
<v Marwan Altaie>in the system,
your partners or your cashiers,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15813-5
02:56:24.682 --> 02:56:28.437
<v Marwan Altaie>or your credit controllers go in and they
have clear visibility of exactly what</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15813-6
02:56:28.437 --> 02:56:30.596
<v Marwan Altaie>needs to be done when it needs to be done
by.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15815-0
02:56:31.316 --> 02:56:32.956
<v Marwan Altaie>That kind of stuff?
Not quite a business stuff.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15840-0
02:56:35.636 --> 02:56:39.374
<v Marwan Altaie>The wider business have access to this,
so I'm a requester.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15840-1
02:56:39.374 --> 02:56:44.607
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm a partner and I've sent my request in.
Will they be able to go in and say Oh my</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15840-2
02:56:44.607 --> 02:56:49.653
<v Marwan Altaie>request is sat with Jill Collins now or
they just not see it until it's finished</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15840-3
02:56:49.653 --> 02:56:50.276
<v Marwan Altaie>completed?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15894-0
02:56:51.516 --> 02:56:54.509
<v Marwan Altaie>So from a post perspective,
they will have a lot of transparency in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15894-1
02:56:54.509 --> 02:56:57.811
<v Marwan Altaie>terms of the state citizen who's sitting
with the comments that made back.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15894-2
02:56:57.811 --> 02:57:01.244
<v Marwan Altaie>If you want to make comments that are
available for them, see like, you know,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15894-3
02:57:01.244 --> 02:57:03.754
<v Marwan Altaie>received it we're updating or we're
contacting the bank,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15894-4
02:57:03.754 --> 02:57:06.131
<v Marwan Altaie>we're going to have a look at the next
invoice round.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15894-5
02:57:06.131 --> 02:57:07.716
<v Marwan Altaie>You know all these different things.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15901-0
02:57:08.276 --> 02:57:10.038
<v Marwan Altaie>You can provide those comments back on
the portal,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15901-1
02:57:10.038 --> 02:57:11.836
<v Marwan Altaie>so there's a one single place for this
guy as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15953-0
02:57:13.676 --> 02:57:17.868
<v Marwan Altaie>I think the easiest way is you just have
a potentially not a report specifically,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15953-1
02:57:17.868 --> 02:57:22.060
<v Marwan Altaie>but if you want your partners or ticket
races or whoever to have that visibility,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15953-2
02:57:22.060 --> 02:57:25.690
<v Marwan Altaie>you probably just have a widget on your
main page that just shows you.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15953-3
02:57:25.690 --> 02:57:29.116
<v Marwan Altaie>These are your tickets,
so your status is just quick simple, yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15968-0
02:57:30.236 --> 02:57:35.708
<v Marwan Altaie>Once. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool.
Chris, will these reports be new?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15968-1
02:57:35.708 --> 02:57:39.596
<v Marwan Altaie>Said that none of these reports are
existing reports.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15980-0
02:57:50.316 --> 02:57:53.913
<v Marwan Altaie>They will be new.
There are nuances that we probably not</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/15980-1
02:57:53.913 --> 02:57:55.996
<v Marwan Altaie>specific like that, but probably.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16025-0
02:57:58.356 --> 02:58:00.838
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes, I would say they are.
They would be mostly new.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16025-1
02:58:00.838 --> 02:58:04.024
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm not sure we would need them all,
but something to look through.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16025-2
02:58:04.024 --> 02:58:07.021
<v Marwan Altaie>I think what I need to see is the end to
end process bit. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16025-3
02:58:07.021 --> 02:58:09.364
<v Marwan Altaie>I think that's gonna help you visualise
it. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16025-4
02:58:09.364 --> 02:58:12.596
<v Marwan Altaie>Even talking today it was very difficult
to piece together bits and.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16072-0
02:58:13.116 --> 02:58:15.139
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.
So particularly from the report</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16072-1
02:58:15.139 --> 02:58:18.068
<v Marwan Altaie>perspective,
you guys obviously aren't on sharewell at</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16072-2
02:58:18.068 --> 02:58:20.678
<v Marwan Altaie>the moment,
but joy from a wider as perspective.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16072-3
02:58:20.678 --> 02:58:24.672
<v Marwan Altaie>There's certain reports that we take out
of sharewell on volumes etcetera,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16072-4
02:58:24.672 --> 02:58:27.708
<v Marwan Altaie>we will replicate that in service now for
all the teams,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16072-5
02:58:27.708 --> 02:58:31.436
<v Marwan Altaie>but they will be internal reports for us
to use as a management team.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16112-0
02:58:32.396 --> 02:58:35.866
<v Marwan Altaie>I think the role then also be from a
finance perspective,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16112-1
02:58:35.866 --> 02:58:40.474
<v Marwan Altaie>KPIs etcetera that are wider than ask and
that we need to perhaps feed into.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16112-2
02:58:40.474 --> 02:58:45.082
<v Marwan Altaie>But the question will be what's the
source of truth for that information and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16112-3
02:58:45.082 --> 02:58:47.356
<v Marwan Altaie>where should that report come from so.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16151-0
02:58:47.716 --> 02:58:51.054
<v Marwan Altaie>I think the impact,
particularly for credit control will be</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16151-1
02:58:51.054 --> 02:58:53.503
<v Marwan Altaie>internally for ask in terms of the
reports,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16151-2
02:58:53.503 --> 02:58:57.621
<v Marwan Altaie>the other kind of report and stuff is
something that we will need to work</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16151-3
02:58:57.621 --> 02:59:02.072
<v Marwan Altaie>through because of the safer finance.
It will be 3 reports that might feed into</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16151-4
02:59:02.072 --> 02:59:04.076
<v Marwan Altaie>it rather than our ServiceNow cases.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16165-0
02:59:06.756 --> 02:59:12.429
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry, this is really nitpicky for sure.
In Line 5 you've got cashiering and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16165-1
02:59:12.429 --> 02:59:13.756
<v Marwan Altaie>finance OPS trust.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16217-0
02:59:15.516 --> 02:59:19.066
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm going to assume that they should
actually be the same thing.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16217-1
02:59:19.066 --> 02:59:21.961
<v Marwan Altaie>Have you got a difference between the two?
So trust,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16217-2
02:59:21.961 --> 02:59:25.838
<v Marwan Altaie>refunds and transfers in progress?
Parent case that so might not be as</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16217-3
02:59:25.838 --> 02:59:28.624
<v Marwan Altaie>relevant.
So this is before I knew Cashiering does</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16217-4
02:59:28.624 --> 02:59:31.409
<v Marwan Altaie>the transfer,
so I thought maybe we could create a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16217-5
02:59:31.409 --> 02:59:33.867
<v Marwan Altaie>child task.
It was additional functionality,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16217-6
02:59:33.867 --> 02:59:34.796
<v Marwan Altaie>but you're right.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16224-0
02:59:34.876 --> 02:59:37.354
<v Marwan Altaie>Right,
that probably can be simplified so it</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16224-1
02:59:37.354 --> 02:59:39.116
<v Marwan Altaie>doesn't need to be two separate.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16238-0
02:59:40.516 --> 02:59:45.682
<v Marwan Altaie>I think any any anywhere that trust is
referred to. It's just cashiers. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16238-1
02:59:45.682 --> 02:59:48.596
<v Marwan Altaie>yeah. Make it easy for you guys.
Thank you.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16240-0
02:59:53.836 --> 02:59:54.196
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16248-0
02:59:57.556 --> 02:59:59.756
<v Marwan Altaie>So we've got to the end of credit control.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16262-0
03:00:02.396 --> 03:00:07.021
<v Marwan Altaie>Is everyone happy with where we're at?
Discussions take away actions.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16262-1
03:00:07.021 --> 03:00:11.316
<v Marwan Altaie>The follow up meetings.
We're definitely gonna need to have and.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16272-0
03:00:12.836 --> 03:00:18.191
<v Marwan Altaie>Are we going to go back to do Oz suspense?
Apologies. Yeah, I did miss that one up.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16272-1
03:00:18.191 --> 03:00:18.956
<v Marwan Altaie>I just want.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16291-0
03:00:20.356 --> 03:00:24.381
<v Marwan Altaie>Just because there's no point in Steven
or Martin being online for that,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16291-1
03:00:24.381 --> 03:00:28.075
<v Marwan Altaie>I thought, like Martin,
if you're still online and you want to go,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16291-2
03:00:28.075 --> 03:00:28.516
<v Marwan Altaie>you can.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16302-0
03:00:31.036 --> 03:00:33.916
<v Marwan Altaie>That was suspense.
Is such a big thing he's gone.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16305-0
03:00:34.436 --> 03:00:35.996
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>No problem. I will leave you to it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16318-0
03:00:36.596 --> 03:00:40.439
<v Marwan Altaie>Thanks, Martin. Thanks, Martin. Yeah,
it's such a big piece,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16308-0
03:00:37.756 --> 03:00:38.236
<v McGinley, Martin 14260>Bye.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16318-1
03:00:40.439 --> 03:00:43.716
<v Marwan Altaie>but I don't really wanna leave without
touching it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16323-0
03:00:44.956 --> 03:00:47.556
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool. Sorry, Chris. It's likewise.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16325-0
03:00:50.116 --> 03:00:51.156
<v Marwan Altaie>But I don't.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16345-0
03:00:56.716 --> 03:00:59.315
<v Marwan Altaie>Does everyone want a 5 minute break?
I'm aware it's 434.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16345-1
03:00:59.315 --> 03:01:02.736
<v Marwan Altaie>Do you want to have a quick sugar snack
break or do you want to just blitz</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16345-2
03:01:02.736 --> 03:01:04.196
<v Marwan Altaie>through this so everyone can go?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16349-0
03:01:09.116 --> 03:01:09.356
<v Marwan Altaie>Are you?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16381-0
03:01:12.076 --> 03:01:17.699
<v Marwan Altaie>Everyone. What's next to keep them going?
Yeah, cool. OK, so suspense.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16381-1
03:01:17.699 --> 03:01:22.531
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm assuming this is an
oversimplification of the programme.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16381-2
03:01:22.531 --> 03:01:28.076
<v Marwan Altaie>It's not clear, but at a high level,
it's assuming that all of these.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16422-0
03:01:28.316 --> 03:01:32.869
<v Marwan Altaie>Pluses to a managing office to transfer
invoice receipt entry request,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16422-1
03:01:32.869 --> 03:01:37.936
<v Marwan Altaie>Client bank details for the refund.
All of those kick off their own processes,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16422-2
03:01:37.936 --> 03:01:43.195
<v Marwan Altaie>so this is focusing on that initial get
it to the right person and then have that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16422-3
03:01:43.195 --> 03:01:47.236
<v Marwan Altaie>substream if that makes sense. Yeah.
So this would become a A.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16451-0
03:01:48.116 --> 03:01:53.744
<v Marwan Altaie>Probably a sub task of unallocated unless
we want to make it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16451-1
03:01:53.744 --> 03:02:00.009
<v Marwan Altaie>It's a new like a new task,
but the only way that we would trigger a</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16451-2
03:02:00.009 --> 03:02:04.276
<v Marwan Altaie>suspense account transaction would be
through.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16460-0
03:02:04.756 --> 03:02:08.716
<v Marwan Altaie>An unallocated expense that needs a
partial allocation.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16502-0
03:02:10.636 --> 03:02:16.416
<v Marwan Altaie>That's the only scenario. Yeah. OK.
So everything starts off as an</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16502-1
03:02:16.416 --> 03:02:22.283
<v Marwan Altaie>unallocated amount and it is either
returned to client or refunded,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16502-2
03:02:22.283 --> 03:02:29.099
<v Marwan Altaie>receded in full, or receded partially.
And it's that partial receipt that then</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16502-3
03:02:29.099 --> 03:02:29.876
<v Marwan Altaie>needs to.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16551-0
03:02:29.996 --> 03:02:34.686
<v Marwan Altaie>We put into suspense because we've got
partial invoice and then the rest of it</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16551-1
03:02:34.686 --> 03:02:38.189
<v Marwan Altaie>has to go somewhere,
and that's where the suspense account</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16551-2
03:02:38.189 --> 03:02:41.098
<v Marwan Altaie>comes in.
It's balance sheet item and there's no</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16551-3
03:02:41.098 --> 03:02:43.770
<v Marwan Altaie>scenario.
Apologies for the stupid question.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16551-4
03:02:43.770 --> 03:02:48.519
<v Marwan Altaie>A client instruction specifically asking
you to put it for whatever reason. No,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16551-5
03:02:48.519 --> 03:02:48.876
<v Marwan Altaie>never.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16597-0
03:02:49.796 --> 03:02:54.646
<v Marwan Altaie>The instruction to put to suspense should
only ever come from credit control for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16597-1
03:02:54.646 --> 03:02:57.819
<v Marwan Altaie>cashiers,
but the client might tell credit controls.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16597-2
03:02:57.819 --> 03:03:02.370
<v Marwan Altaie>But in so supposing we received $1,000,
000? Yep, and they paid 2 invoices,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16597-3
03:03:02.370 --> 03:03:06.142
<v Marwan Altaie>500 a thousand each,
and we paid 1500 a $1000 invoice and then</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16597-4
03:03:06.142 --> 03:03:09.316
<v Marwan Altaie>said the client look, it's two,
it's 400 a thousand.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16643-0
03:03:09.476 --> 03:03:12.037
<v Marwan Altaie>What's to do with it?
And they said just keep hold of it and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16643-1
03:03:12.037 --> 03:03:15.143
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll put it towards another bill or
something and we put it on suspense.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16643-2
03:03:15.143 --> 03:03:17.033
<v Marwan Altaie>Then they might say keep hold of it for
now.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16643-3
03:03:17.033 --> 03:03:19.342
<v Marwan Altaie>We need to think about what we're going
to do with it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16643-4
03:03:19.342 --> 03:03:21.987
<v Marwan Altaie>and we'll come back to you later and
we'll put it on suspense.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16643-5
03:03:21.987 --> 03:03:25.093
<v Marwan Altaie>But that instruction would come from
credit control to the client client,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16643-6
03:03:25.093 --> 03:03:27.948
<v Marwan Altaie>to the credit controller.
Credit controller would let cash is done.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16643-7
03:03:27.948 --> 03:03:28.956
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. So as far as cash.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16651-0
03:03:29.036 --> 03:03:33.142
<v Marwan Altaie>She is a concerned that instruction comes
directly from credit control. Yep,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16651-1
03:03:33.142 --> 03:03:34.636
<v Marwan Altaie>credit control. I have that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16655-0
03:03:37.316 --> 03:03:39.476
<v Marwan Altaie>Pouring down from the account as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16693-0
03:03:42.036 --> 03:03:45.820
<v Marwan Altaie>That's that's probably like a decision.
So with suspense,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16693-1
03:03:45.820 --> 03:03:48.953
<v Marwan Altaie>you've got a couple of options that you
can do.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16693-2
03:03:48.953 --> 03:03:52.346
<v Marwan Altaie>You can either refund the money back to
the client,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16693-3
03:03:52.346 --> 03:03:56.457
<v Marwan Altaie>which man was saying that they do it from
their client monies.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16693-4
03:03:56.457 --> 03:03:59.916
<v Marwan Altaie>We do it from office because it's much
easier to do.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16713-0
03:04:01.276 --> 03:04:04.999
<v Marwan Altaie>And that's that refund process that we've
gone over.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16713-1
03:04:04.999 --> 03:04:09.494
<v Marwan Altaie>We can move the money into our trust
account or client account,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16713-2
03:04:09.494 --> 03:04:12.796
<v Marwan Altaie>which again same process that we've
looked at.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16765-0
03:04:15.036 --> 03:04:19.192
<v Marwan Altaie>Or you can also do an allocation directly
from suspense to another invoice.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16765-1
03:04:19.192 --> 03:04:23.348
<v Marwan Altaie>Would that be a separate process to apply
to bill, or would that be within?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16765-2
03:04:23.348 --> 03:04:25.918
<v Marwan Altaie>That's that's apply to Bill. Yeah, yeah,
fine.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16765-3
03:04:25.918 --> 03:04:30.129
<v Marwan Altaie>So those those 3 align with what you
expect from this process. Mm-hmm. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16765-4
03:04:30.129 --> 03:04:33.082
<v Marwan Altaie>definitely.
So they're the only three options that we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16765-5
03:04:33.082 --> 03:04:33.356
<v Marwan Altaie>have.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16766-0
03:04:36.956 --> 03:04:37.236
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16784-0
03:04:38.196 --> 03:04:43.219
<v Marwan Altaie>I think that's it. Yeah. Great.
And approvals from partner or from credit</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16784-1
03:04:43.219 --> 03:04:47.156
<v Marwan Altaie>manager or is there any approval
processes in the system?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16786-0
03:04:48.956 --> 03:04:49.516
<v Marwan Altaie>So must is it?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16790-0
03:04:50.756 --> 03:04:53.196
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, I mean credit control have.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16831-0
03:04:55.116 --> 03:04:59.843
<v Marwan Altaie>Call I get like an interaction or
investigations to what needs to happen so</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16831-1
03:04:59.843 --> 03:05:04.073
<v Marwan Altaie>the instruction can come from a partner.
It can come from a client,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16831-2
03:05:04.073 --> 03:05:08.490
<v Marwan Altaie>it can come from the client's AP team.
It can come from credit control</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16831-3
03:05:08.490 --> 03:05:10.356
<v Marwan Altaie>themselves to make a decision.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16882-0
03:05:11.596 --> 03:05:15.344
<v Marwan Altaie>As far as cashiers are concerned,
the instruction comes from directly from</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16882-1
03:05:15.344 --> 03:05:18.242
<v Marwan Altaie>credit control.
They're just hearing from someone else so</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16882-2
03:05:18.242 --> 03:05:21.041
<v Marwan Altaie>much like before,
we would credit control would get the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16882-3
03:05:21.041 --> 03:05:24.389
<v Marwan Altaie>information from the client.
Part of the PE, whatever it might be,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16882-4
03:05:24.389 --> 03:05:28.237
<v Marwan Altaie>would attach it to the request and then
send that request on to cashiers who</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16882-5
03:05:28.237 --> 03:05:30.836
<v Marwan Altaie>would assume if it's come from us,
that's the yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16915-0
03:05:30.996 --> 03:05:33.224
<v Marwan Altaie>That's the proof,
and you've got to attach. OK,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16915-1
03:05:33.224 --> 03:05:35.591
<v Marwan Altaie>so credit control.
So cashier generally raises it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16915-2
03:05:35.591 --> 03:05:38.423
<v Marwan Altaie>Credit control investigates. Yeah.
It might go to a partner.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16915-3
03:05:38.423 --> 03:05:40.604
<v Marwan Altaie>It might not if it's a refund.
But ultimately,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16915-4
03:05:40.604 --> 03:05:43.761
<v Marwan Altaie>cashier is expecting the credit
controller to confirm any of those.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16915-5
03:05:43.761 --> 03:05:47.196
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's basically credit controller
cashier and that's the process. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16946-0
03:05:47.716 --> 03:05:51.754
<v Marwan Altaie>Probably it's not so simple, it does.
It sounds like a brief one.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16946-1
03:05:51.754 --> 03:05:56.832
<v Marwan Altaie>It's one of the IT causes the most grief
and it's one of the things that we failed</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16946-2
03:05:56.832 --> 03:06:00.687
<v Marwan Altaie>on our audience. Yeah,
we were doing it manually and it wasn't</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16946-3
03:06:00.687 --> 03:06:03.196
<v Marwan Altaie>picked up properly. There was not enough.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16982-0
03:06:03.796 --> 03:06:06.486
<v Marwan Altaie>Ownership.
This is where we see a real win for this,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16982-1
03:06:06.486 --> 03:06:10.649
<v Marwan Altaie>because right now it's very easy to look
at Excel spreadsheet ignore as if you've</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16982-2
03:06:10.649 --> 03:06:14.659
<v Marwan Altaie>got something in your some of your name
going up to you saying you've got 5 in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16982-3
03:06:14.659 --> 03:06:17.604
<v Marwan Altaie>your queue, what you're doing,
it's a lot more different.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/16982-4
03:06:17.604 --> 03:06:19.076
<v Marwan Altaie>So they're filtered by Excel.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17023-0
03:06:19.596 --> 03:06:24.662
<v Marwan Altaie>It'll be easier to report on to senior
managers as well through ServiceNow,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17023-1
03:06:24.662 --> 03:06:27.729
<v Marwan Altaie>which is look, Sandeep,
has visibility on it,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17023-2
03:06:27.729 --> 03:06:33.262
<v Marwan Altaie>but we're kind of not really putting our
hands up to say this should be visible to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17023-3
03:06:33.262 --> 03:06:36.796
<v Marwan Altaie>the business.
We're just kind of keeping it a little</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17023-4
03:06:36.796 --> 03:06:38.796
<v Marwan Altaie>bit more in house and letting.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17058-0
03:06:38.876 --> 03:06:41.893
<v Marwan Altaie>And people who absolutely must know about
this,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17058-1
03:06:41.893 --> 03:06:47.047
<v Marwan Altaie>so it will provide a bit more visibility,
hopefully a bit more accountability for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17058-2
03:06:47.047 --> 03:06:50.190
<v Marwan Altaie>everyone,
because no doubt Lynn will want to look</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17058-3
03:06:50.190 --> 03:06:53.521
<v Marwan Altaie>at this too,
Sandeep and I have it on all objectives</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17058-4
03:06:53.521 --> 03:06:57.041
<v Marwan Altaie>for this year.
So I'm sure there's nothing in suspense.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17058-5
03:06:57.041 --> 03:06:57.356
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17093-0
03:06:58.316 --> 03:07:04.233
<v Marwan Altaie>I'll send I'll send the spreadsheet like
at today to you guys to have a look at</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17093-1
03:07:04.233 --> 03:07:08.448
<v Marwan Altaie>gross. Lovely.
So is this one of these ones that we want</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17093-2
03:07:08.448 --> 03:07:13.700
<v Marwan Altaie>to set in a separate dashboard again and
trigger regular reviews? Yes,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17093-3
03:07:13.700 --> 03:07:17.916
<v Marwan Altaie>it works slightly differently. No,
we did touch on this.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17144-0
03:07:17.996 --> 03:07:20.936
<v Marwan Altaie>Last week,
through the cashier's workshop in</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17144-1
03:07:20.936 --> 03:07:24.072
<v Marwan Altaie>particular,
because similar to the unallocated,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17144-2
03:07:24.072 --> 03:07:29.298
<v Marwan Altaie>ideally would love to be able to track
suspense items in ServiceNow rather than</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17144-3
03:07:29.298 --> 03:07:33.610
<v Marwan Altaie>in a spreadsheet like this.
I really want to be able to automate.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17144-4
03:07:33.610 --> 03:07:37.596
<v Marwan Altaie>Sandeep was really keen to automate it as
well. We know who.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17181-0
03:07:38.116 --> 03:07:43.204
<v Marwan Altaie>What items are sitting with which which
credit controllers they can add comments</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17181-1
03:07:43.204 --> 03:07:48.480
<v Marwan Altaie>in really easily that are timestamped and
then we can reassign it back to a cashier</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17181-2
03:07:48.480 --> 03:07:53.380
<v Marwan Altaie>when something needs to happen because
basically any movement out of suspense</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17181-3
03:07:53.380 --> 03:07:55.076
<v Marwan Altaie>has to happen by a cashier.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17221-0
03:07:55.796 --> 03:07:58.979
<v Marwan Altaie>So it doesn't matter what it is,
but I'm assuming we can.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17221-1
03:07:58.979 --> 03:08:01.669
<v Marwan Altaie>All we can do that all from that
dashboard view.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17221-2
03:08:01.669 --> 03:08:06.005
<v Marwan Altaie>So as long as cashier and and credit
control have access to the same dashboard</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17221-3
03:08:06.005 --> 03:08:10.506
<v Marwan Altaie>view, we can see who it's been sent by,
who it's sitting with and credit control.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17221-4
03:08:10.506 --> 03:08:13.196
<v Marwan Altaie>And then when it hands back over. Yeah,
because.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17272-0
03:08:15.116 --> 03:08:18.285
<v Marwan Altaie>A broader a broader finance dashboard,
which will have each of those different</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17272-1
03:08:18.285 --> 03:08:20.491
<v Marwan Altaie>departments,
and within each of those different parts,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17272-2
03:08:20.491 --> 03:08:23.339
<v Marwan Altaie>they're probably different tabs.
And within that you'll have all those</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17272-3
03:08:23.339 --> 03:08:25.264
<v Marwan Altaie>different reports that you can look at as
well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17272-4
03:08:25.264 --> 03:08:28.594
<v Marwan Altaie>And then you can start to philtre them by
different things that you're starting to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17272-5
03:08:28.594 --> 03:08:29.236
<v Marwan Altaie>capture as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17320-0
03:08:29.556 --> 03:08:32.894
<v Marwan Altaie>So that's probably what we'll have to
take away and kind of start to build that</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17320-1
03:08:32.894 --> 03:08:36.107
<v Marwan Altaie>kind of end to end finance dashboard.
That doesn't stop you from like I said</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17320-2
03:08:36.107 --> 03:08:39.278
<v Marwan Altaie>with being cashiering or credit control
having your own dashboards as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17320-3
03:08:39.278 --> 03:08:41.990
<v Marwan Altaie>But there probably just needs to be that
kind of end to end one.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17320-4
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:44.577
<v Marwan Altaie>So from a transparency and actioning
certain items like this,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17320-5
03:08:44.577 --> 03:08:45.996
<v Marwan Altaie>it becomes so much easier as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17354-0
03:08:46.476 --> 03:08:52.257
<v Marwan Altaie>Like status owner who's sat with 'cause,
I think we touched on it before where</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17354-1
03:08:52.257 --> 03:08:56.355
<v Marwan Altaie>obviously 3 E generally is our finance
source of truth,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17354-2
03:08:56.355 --> 03:09:01.844
<v Marwan Altaie>but I want ServiceNow to be our source of
truth for suspense because until</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17354-3
03:09:01.844 --> 03:09:02.796
<v Marwan Altaie>something is.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17387-0
03:09:03.236 --> 03:09:08.248
<v Marwan Altaie>Out allocated in onto an invoice or
transferred into trust, or paid back.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17387-1
03:09:08.248 --> 03:09:11.431
<v Marwan Altaie>It's not.
It's not easily easy tracked because</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17387-2
03:09:11.431 --> 03:09:16.511
<v Marwan Altaie>there's so much movement going in and out
of the Ledger that right now the</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17387-3
03:09:16.511 --> 03:09:19.356
<v Marwan Altaie>spreadsheet has to be the source of truth.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17426-0
03:09:20.556 --> 03:09:22.829
<v Marwan Altaie>Just ServiceNow needs to be your system
of action,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17426-1
03:09:22.829 --> 03:09:25.905
<v Marwan Altaie>so it's the way that you can then start
to track that as well. Yeah,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17426-2
03:09:25.905 --> 03:09:29.338
<v Marwan Altaie>makes the most sense. Yeah. You know,
we're talking about about the partners</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17426-3
03:09:29.338 --> 03:09:31.924
<v Marwan Altaie>access to one. You know,
one place to go to dealer place.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17426-4
03:09:31.924 --> 03:09:34.064
<v Marwan Altaie>I would say from a user's perspective,
finance,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17426-5
03:09:34.064 --> 03:09:36.516
<v Marwan Altaie>it would be great if we're not having to
look through.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17465-0
03:09:37.156 --> 03:09:39.044
<v Marwan Altaie>Think critical job specifically.
You won't.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17465-1
03:09:39.044 --> 03:09:42.563
<v Marwan Altaie>Don't you share well and probably don't
want five different tiles to look through</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17465-2
03:09:42.563 --> 03:09:45.138
<v Marwan Altaie>for something because need to make it
simple for that user.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17465-3
03:09:45.138 --> 03:09:48.442
<v Marwan Altaie>They need one port of call to go to,
not have to go into a tab and then have</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17465-4
03:09:48.442 --> 03:09:50.759
<v Marwan Altaie>to go to another tab.
They have to go to another tab.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17465-5
03:09:50.759 --> 03:09:52.476
<v Marwan Altaie>You've got to lose people straight away.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17499-0
03:09:52.996 --> 03:09:56.103
<v Marwan Altaie>We're going to have to select them in the
1st place,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17499-1
03:09:56.103 --> 03:09:59.679
<v Marwan Altaie>so we need to make it as simple as
possible for those users,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17499-2
03:09:59.679 --> 03:10:02.610
<v Marwan Altaie>those team members to go into.
Do you mean Bruce,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17499-3
03:10:02.610 --> 03:10:06.597
<v Marwan Altaie>that certain teams should only see what
is relevant for them? Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17499-4
03:10:06.597 --> 03:10:08.356
<v Marwan Altaie>And ideally it it put us in a.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17530-0
03:10:08.916 --> 03:10:12.577
<v Marwan Altaie>In one place, if you know what I mean,
I don't want to have to have 10 tabs for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17530-1
03:10:12.577 --> 03:10:16.009
<v Marwan Altaie>finance. Then pick better control,
then go to another tab and then go pick</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17530-2
03:10:16.009 --> 03:10:18.572
<v Marwan Altaie>something else. Yeah,
it needs to be visible. You know,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17530-3
03:10:18.572 --> 03:10:20.585
<v Marwan Altaie>I log on in the morning.
There's my screen.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17530-4
03:10:20.585 --> 03:10:23.697
<v Marwan Altaie>There's my thing with the number one on
it. What you're working on,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17530-5
03:10:23.697 --> 03:10:24.796
<v Marwan Altaie>so you'll have your own.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17581-0
03:10:26.036 --> 03:10:29.317
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. OK. I just say, yeah,
for the particularly, if you're, you know,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17581-1
03:10:29.317 --> 03:10:32.552
<v Marwan Altaie>one of the analysts or one of the amount
team leads when you come in,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17581-2
03:10:32.552 --> 03:10:35.372
<v Marwan Altaie>you have a workspace.
So the workspace has all the key items</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17581-3
03:10:35.372 --> 03:10:38.746
<v Marwan Altaie>that I need. It could be group by date,
it could be big group by amount.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17581-4
03:10:38.746 --> 03:10:41.380
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm making up,
which I've that is just one dashboard for</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17581-5
03:10:41.380 --> 03:10:43.876
<v Marwan Altaie>them to work off of.
That's different to kind of the.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17618-0
03:10:44.596 --> 03:10:48.039
<v Marwan Altaie>Leadership executive type reporting where
it's summarising lots of information.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17618-1
03:10:48.039 --> 03:10:50.407
<v Marwan Altaie>To be honest,
the analysts probably aren't going to go</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17618-2
03:10:50.407 --> 03:10:52.731
<v Marwan Altaie>in there that often.
It's more for the leadership and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17618-3
03:10:52.731 --> 03:10:55.400
<v Marwan Altaie>management, but for their day-to-day,
that's their dashboard.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17618-4
03:10:55.400 --> 03:10:57.337
<v Marwan Altaie>That's their workspace and they'll click
in,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17618-5
03:10:57.337 --> 03:11:00.436
<v Marwan Altaie>they can drill down to specific cases
that they need to action as well.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17667-0
03:11:00.556 --> 03:11:04.169
<v Marwan Altaie>It's one place. Yeah. Yeah,
that's the one I'm trying to get to. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17667-1
03:11:04.169 --> 03:11:07.985
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. And I suppose in this instance,
what we're probably talking about is</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17667-2
03:11:07.985 --> 03:11:11.089
<v Marwan Altaie>you'll have a collective spreadsheet
replica dashboard view.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17667-3
03:11:11.089 --> 03:11:15.211
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't know what else to call it just
now that both credit control and cashier,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17667-4
03:11:15.211 --> 03:11:16.636
<v Marwan Altaie>and we'll have oversight on.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17692-0
03:11:16.916 --> 03:11:21.188
<v Marwan Altaie>But actually if those tasks and cases or
whatever are allocated to individuals,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17692-1
03:11:21.188 --> 03:11:25.300
<v Marwan Altaie>they'll look at their own individual
dashboard and see that in there without</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17692-2
03:11:25.300 --> 03:11:27.116
<v Marwan Altaie>the rest of the noise. Yeah, cool.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17693-0
03:11:30.796 --> 03:11:31.356
<v Marwan Altaie>Umm.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17715-0
03:11:32.956 --> 03:11:38.584
<v Marwan Altaie>Oh, I'm happy with suspense. Accounts,
Slas, same as the rest of them,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17715-1
03:11:38.584 --> 03:11:44.926
<v Marwan Altaie>which is going to assume 2448 hours.
Hours. Yeah, yeah. Wait, that's up to you,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17715-2
03:11:44.926 --> 03:11:46.036
<v Marwan Altaie>Chris. I just.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17745-0
03:11:48.116 --> 03:11:50.570
<v Marwan Altaie>Actually, no,
it actually it'll be longer from that,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17745-1
03:11:50.570 --> 03:11:52.931
<v Marwan Altaie>but we'll let's deal with that closer
time. We'll,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17745-2
03:11:52.931 --> 03:11:56.080
<v Marwan Altaie>I feel like we'll do question we need
answer just now because we'll</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17745-3
03:11:56.080 --> 03:11:57.516
<v Marwan Altaie>systematically work through it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17763-0
03:12:02.436 --> 03:12:06.558
<v Marwan Altaie>So suspense account fields. Like we said,
we're gonna have additional comments on</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17763-1
03:12:06.558 --> 03:12:07.916
<v Marwan Altaie>calls. Make a note of that.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17766-0
03:12:10.436 --> 03:12:11.716
<v Marwan Altaie>Optional attachments.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17780-0
03:12:13.836 --> 03:12:16.843
<v Marwan Altaie>Best type?
We don't need to reach an entity.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17780-1
03:12:16.843 --> 03:12:19.516
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we have the suspense that's on there?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17781-0
03:12:22.476 --> 03:12:24.716
<v Marwan Altaie>Major entertain. So you got amount.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17810-0
03:12:26.316 --> 03:12:29.831
<v Marwan Altaie>Any client matter?
Do you have client matter? No,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17810-1
03:12:29.831 --> 03:12:34.121
<v Marwan Altaie>it's pretty backstage,
like mostly information is in the GL.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17810-2
03:12:34.121 --> 03:12:39.183
<v Marwan Altaie>So you got bank reference suspense
reference. So do you want the trend?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17810-3
03:12:39.183 --> 03:12:41.996
<v Marwan Altaie>Do you want the currency or the account?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17817-0
03:12:43.556 --> 03:12:46.676
<v Marwan Altaie>Currency don't care. Yeah,
currency amount.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17849-0
03:12:50.476 --> 03:12:56.678
<v Marwan Altaie>Can we add in bank statement date or a
date because the date that we're posting</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17849-1
03:12:56.678 --> 03:13:02.802
<v Marwan Altaie>it to suspense is not necessarily the
date that the transaction came in and we</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17849-2
03:13:02.802 --> 03:13:05.516
<v Marwan Altaie>want generally want to report both.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17858-0
03:13:06.076 --> 03:13:08.608
<v Marwan Altaie>OK,
so we want transaction date and bank</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17858-1
03:13:08.608 --> 03:13:10.276
<v Marwan Altaie>statement dates of request.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17890-0
03:13:12.076 --> 03:13:15.427
<v Marwan Altaie>What's it called?
One's bank statement date? Definitely.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17890-1
03:13:15.427 --> 03:13:20.130
<v Marwan Altaie>That's the one. Next. Well, in here.
We've got a transaction date and AGL date.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17890-2
03:13:20.130 --> 03:13:23.187
<v Marwan Altaie>So the transaction date is when we
actually got it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17890-3
03:13:23.187 --> 03:13:27.596
<v Marwan Altaie>The GL is when it was posted to our
Ledger. You want to call it that then?</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17923-0
03:13:29.876 --> 03:13:33.789
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's like a replication tree by using
the terminology. Yeah, it'll work,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17923-1
03:13:33.789 --> 03:13:36.775
<v Marwan Altaie>bank statement,
date and then I don't know, posting date.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17923-2
03:13:36.775 --> 03:13:40.431
<v Marwan Altaie>So bank statement date and posting date
no, no transaction date. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17923-3
03:13:40.431 --> 03:13:43.932
<v Marwan Altaie>Again we can change these.
It's just to kind of drive from notation</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17923-4
03:13:43.932 --> 03:13:44.396
<v Marwan Altaie>and yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17944-0
03:13:47.036 --> 03:13:51.416
<v Marwan Altaie>Also, I've got additional comments,
optional attachments, request type,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17944-1
03:13:51.416 --> 03:13:55.796
<v Marwan Altaie>no region or entity currency amount,
bank statement date, posting date.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17954-0
03:13:58.436 --> 03:14:03.116
<v Marwan Altaie>That's right. Yeah. I think that's it.
Cool. They sure will take a number.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17955-0
03:14:05.076 --> 03:14:05.196
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17985-0
03:14:08.396 --> 03:14:12.494
<v Marwan Altaie>OK. Are we happy with suspense? Yeah,
it sounded much more simple this</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17985-1
03:14:12.494 --> 03:14:15.380
<v Marwan Altaie>afternoon.
They did first thing a little earlier.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17985-2
03:14:15.380 --> 03:14:19.074
<v Marwan Altaie>Quite sure why. But anyway,
we've got the rest of the workflow.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/17985-3
03:14:19.074 --> 03:14:22.076
<v Marwan Altaie>This is. Yeah.
This is now making a bit more sense.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18026-0
03:14:22.476 --> 03:14:26.232
<v Marwan Altaie>It's just like a similar workflow,
it's just slightly different. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18026-1
03:14:26.232 --> 03:14:28.622
<v Marwan Altaie>Mm-hmm.
I think Martin's saying it's the same as</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18026-2
03:14:28.622 --> 03:14:31.159
<v Marwan Altaie>current account,
just with different account names.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18026-3
03:14:31.159 --> 03:14:34.623
<v Marwan Altaie>That's it. That's exactly how I see it.
So years, that's how I see it.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18026-4
03:14:34.623 --> 03:14:38.672
<v Marwan Altaie>I think it's exactly the same. Oh, yeah.
Just like an outcome of your unallocated.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18026-5
03:14:38.672 --> 03:14:38.916
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18040-0
03:14:40.316 --> 03:14:43.035
<v Marwan Altaie>But even still,
I think client money is easier to draw</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18040-1
03:14:43.035 --> 03:14:44.716
<v Marwan Altaie>down on in the UK than suspensive.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18084-0
03:14:46.836 --> 03:14:50.434
<v Marwan Altaie>Just double checking.
I haven't missed anything, so yeah, recap,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18084-1
03:14:50.434 --> 03:14:54.586
<v Marwan Altaie>we've gone through as this process is we
have some actions take from this.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18084-2
03:14:54.586 --> 03:14:59.125
<v Marwan Altaie>We've gone through the proposed solution
seems like it's in line with what you're</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18084-3
03:14:59.125 --> 03:15:02.059
<v Marwan Altaie>expecting.
So we're going to use that as a basis and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18084-4
03:15:02.059 --> 03:15:06.156
<v Marwan Altaie>to drive these structures and forms.
Of course, you'll have the decision.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18132-0
03:15:06.276 --> 03:15:10.013
<v Marwan Altaie>Making at the end of this form
submissions agent workspace just the back</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18132-1
03:15:10.013 --> 03:15:13.290
<v Marwan Altaie>end, which is what I showed you. Yeah,
forms routing approvals,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18132-2
03:15:13.290 --> 03:15:16.260
<v Marwan Altaie>approval thresholds.
You'll come back after this and what</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18132-3
03:15:16.260 --> 03:15:19.280
<v Marwan Altaie>we're going to take away from this,
we're going to go off.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18132-4
03:15:19.280 --> 03:15:22.455
<v Marwan Altaie>We're going to document all the
discussions. We'll come back,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18132-5
03:15:22.455 --> 03:15:24.196
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll put some follow up meetings.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18160-0
03:15:24.596 --> 03:15:29.216
<v Marwan Altaie>And we'll continue until we're clear on
the structures and then we'll come back</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18160-1
03:15:29.216 --> 03:15:33.664
<v Marwan Altaie>with a proper proposed solution that
you'll be able to validate or come back</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18160-2
03:15:33.664 --> 03:15:37.996
<v Marwan Altaie>with comments. We're not doing whip.
Don't worry. It's the end of the day.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18161-0
03:15:39.556 --> 03:15:39.676
<v Marwan Altaie>But.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18217-0
03:15:40.756 --> 03:15:43.045
<v Marwan Altaie>So I'll put the next steps.
Basically what I said,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18217-1
03:15:43.045 --> 03:15:46.681
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll do the same for credit control and
whip all the discussions we're going to</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18217-2
03:15:46.681 --> 03:15:49.150
<v Marwan Altaie>put together,
we'll have some follow up SLA and report</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18217-3
03:15:49.150 --> 03:15:52.158
<v Marwan Altaie>workshops where we can go into further
details. But like you said,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18217-4
03:15:52.158 --> 03:15:55.346
<v Marwan Altaie>the reality is they'll probably come
after you've started using it and</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18217-5
03:15:55.346 --> 03:15:57.725
<v Marwan Altaie>understand,
but just at a high level what you'd like</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18217-6
03:15:57.725 --> 03:15:59.476
<v Marwan Altaie>to us for you to structure or plan out.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18247-0
03:15:59.956 --> 03:16:02.330
<v Marwan Altaie>And then once we've got the proposed
solution,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18247-1
03:16:02.330 --> 03:16:05.411
<v Marwan Altaie>the processes all the discussions,
user journeys mapped out,</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18247-2
03:16:05.411 --> 03:16:07.885
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll begin building that solution for
you guys.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18247-3
03:16:07.885 --> 03:16:11.876
<v Marwan Altaie>And ultimately you'll have a nice shiny
solution at the end of this hopefully.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18249-0
03:16:13.756 --> 03:16:14.596
<v Marwan Altaie>That's it. We're done.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18260-0
03:16:16.156 --> 03:16:20.030
<v Marwan Altaie>Here. Cool. Very good. Thanks very much,
Dave. Thank you very much.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18260-1
03:16:20.030 --> 03:16:23.676
<v Marwan Altaie>Cheers everyone on the call.
We're done for today. You're free.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18266-0
03:16:25.876 --> 03:16:27.916
<v Parik Narain>Thank you. Thanks everyone. Bye.</v>

98cff888-8eb5-48a8-8b24-c4911f3c5364/18267-0
03:16:28.036 --> 03:16:28.236
<v Marwan Altaie>So.</v>
