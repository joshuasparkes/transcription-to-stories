Sorry — yes, green. These four categories relate to the person who wants the request and the services they need. For example, when they're buying the rate card, the entry point could be that they don't know the details. That's the task or form that we should put them in: services. If they don’t know, then it’s just the service they want to do, maybe in three clicks rather than what's managed client. There can be all sorts of reasons, but for this particular thing their funding would matter.

Can I just check — would it be beneficial to have a very brief way to show the rates here and what we manage? Is it possible for you to start out doing the checks yourselves? What is our process, not going into technicalities?

The majority of the team's job is global: updating addresses, third-party payers and currencies. Panel agreements are a big thing as well, so we need to ensure they're in the system. It’s all amendments, updates of rates, and anything to do with that. I wanted to check: do you apply this for all client matters and have it agreed within a contract and updated in the system as well?

There are rates and premium rates. On top of that there are tax rates. It’s not just at a client level; certain matters also have discounted rates or volume discounts. Showing that the rates can reduce further is important. For 95% of our audience they may have a registration — that's not typical. For contracts there can be discounts on ticket rates.

With bigger clients we do have panel agreements. For example, in the second year if we build £10 million then anything over £25 million gets a discount. All those terms are part of the panel agreements and should be in the app. The rates are agreed and Geraldine's team is going to ensure those are facilitated.

The bill, which we'll cover tomorrow, is like a PDF generated at the back of the rates and disbursements. That bill PDF can be emailed to the client or sent to e-billing to upload. Just giving you the full circle.

Back to 3E and Cherwell: is there anything on that manage side? I think some rates are at client level. There’s client maintenance and client updates when you get a new client or a new relationship. Partners negotiate rates; sometimes we just get an email. It's not great.

Advisors set rates but they don't always advise us of everything. They may say a partner needs a premium for the tax department with different rates, or there may be a volume discount. On brand new clients, the question is whether this is your first action or if you need separate pre-approval. Often we create the client or create the matter later when the partner or vendor starts work. A matter is then opened and linked — for example, matter number 8123.

The new client is set up by compliance. We don't actually set up a new client; compliance and conflicts handle that. We only add rates and amend billing addresses or PS details. The setup is all done by compliance. At our point we add rates, which is almost the same as matter setup, but the main setup is compliance and conflicts. So we only amend billing address and add rates; we don't create the client.

Sometimes there's a managed client at the client level, but matters break the relationship down. I wonder whether client-level changes should come to someone else first. The notification might be more appropriate at the matter level rather than client. The selling and billing point, the budget for that client, will trigger notifications for the partner when it starts hitting thresholds. They would monitor those notifications, not us. We can add that into the matter.

When a notification is triggered in 3E, that’s outside of our team. Those requests generally come in on a matter where a budget has been set up, and they're fed into the notification. If partners aren't monitoring, we will. We can add the notification into the matter. For large thresholds — 100 or 1,000,000 — that’s where the impact lies.

About compliance and approvals: generally the process is that a PE request goes to 3E for approval by compliance and that also notifies SharePoint/ShareWell. You either have an ad payer request or a peer-approved payer; the ad payer must be done. That process is done on the client side and then comes to us. When we receive it, we generate the request and do our checks. When it comes back, ShareWell will confirm they've done everything and it’s applied to the matter.

You’ll have a task in order to do it. Sometimes a request for a new payer still comes to us and we have to go back to the team and Ruth to determine roles and responsibilities. There should be a checklist saying you need to do SPF three. There should be training — an e-learning module or a half-day — on how you manage rate changes and the PE tab, which we will refresh and include rates. PE involvement is generally to pass on the request rather than to approve it. We should capture gaps in that training for new PE joiners.

Comments and responsibilities are mixed up between Rama billing and the B groups. We need to formalize responsibilities and processes. This will help incentivize staff and provide clarity. The team is about 65% hygiene across everyone; we have regular meetings and we share MI on e-bills weekly. Training is one of the gaps; we need to understand current downstream impacts so we can provide better training.

When we get the request, compliance will send us a ticket. The team goes in and does what’s needed, and they reply-all on the compliance email so you have to scroll through the email thread. The request pops up in 3E; it’s a notification entry. At that point we don’t touch ShareWell until they’ve completed their checks. When they do, we then get a ticket in ShareWell to complete our part. We create a new record if the payer is not there.

There should be a formalized checklist so we have an audit trail and get notifications of that activity. We often have to void the ShareBill at the moment and piece together the original request from compliance via email. We have to chase and make sure whoever did the change is visible. That audit trail and traceability are important.

Can I ask about Cherwell and ServiceNow? Does Cherwell churn it to a ticket? The compliance team will generate and send an automated email. The question is whether notifications have to be manually monitored or if we need an integration. We do need to know what’s been approved. If the request goes into ServiceNow instead of Cherwell, we want the right information in the ticket so the right trigger is fired. Right now teams have to open each notification to know what it is — that’s inefficient. I’ll double-check that part, but my understanding is it comes into 3E and some ticket council.

How do you process that ticket today? We go into 3E, it pops up as a notification. There are a couple of clicks. We don’t touch ShareWell at that point. When ShareWell completes their checks, they create a ticket back into 3E for us to do what’s needed. We have a case service and ShareWell. Compliance categories include new payer and new peer ones; requests sometimes come from the PE or the new payer.

When we receive the request from compliance, we generate the checks. When the request comes in from 3E, it should be a generated notification and then a task in our dashboard to chase. The task sits in the dashboard as "awaiting" — essentially an open ticket. The role is to do the checks, and then to hand it back.

It should be an automated system-generated email from compliance. If compliance can give you the details at the top before they launch, that's helpful. That automation would reduce inefficiency. It should be clear in the notification that approval has been given and what comes next — for instance, mark the request as complete.

We also get chasers when approvals take longer. Then we pull up the ticket and confirm whether compliance has sent approval. If a request is rejected or put on hold, compliance will inform the requester. Those changes don't always come back to us — they might go back to the requester — but we can capture the reason (approved, rejected, on hold) with a pick list so we have measurements and reporting.

Ownership of the workflow is important. Currently operations end up owning the follow-ups and failure demand when they should not. Partners have accountability and should be keeping an eye on approvals to get compliance to sign off. We need joint ownership and metrics that show who is responsible for what. That will enable smoother operations.

On assignment groups: different teams and locations (UK, Australia) will be involved. The assignment group could be global, and anyone in any location can pick it up. Skills matrix will determine assignment. Reassignment is possible and monitoring for traffic is available. This can be global, with the right assignment rules.

New payer vs panel agreement: perhaps capture panel agreements under the rates story. Panel agreements and panel rates are complex and deserve their own category. We also need to capture updates: clients at a high level, an ultimate client or associates under a parent. Data management changes require data management team action; we would not change major client hierarchies without their involvement. If a partner initiates it, data management will perform the change after checks.

Requests to change matter linkage: sometimes you need to link a secondary matter to a primary matter so one bill covers everything. You will check currencies, rates, and ensure the secondary is properly linked. It would help if the request included which is the primary matter and some validation fields so you can process the link without having to chase. Unlinking is rare but could be requested.

Change of matter partner: often we get requests to change which partner is responsible for a matter. The PE triggers this, but we need confirmation that the partner has approved it. We need the effective date (future or retrospective), and the system needs to allow setting the effective date — often it can be from the 1st of a month. We should capture if a change is retrospective and the effective date.

Splits and percentages: when changing matter partner percentages, we need to know the allocation (e.g., 70% and 30%, 50/50). The system should capture those numbers when the request is made. Referrals can be added and need approval similarly. We rarely see a partner reject a change, but it can happen.

Status changes: update matter status (suspend, on hold, cancel, close). Those changes may require compliance approval for some statuses. Requests to suspend or close will often be emailed to us from compliance; sometimes we can make the change without further approval. Effective date should be captured and the status change tracked.

Pending QA status: when a matter is pending QA in 3E, it often means it’s sitting with compliance. We can’t progress until the lifecycle moves forward. If it’s pending QA, that should be visible in the ticket so we know we can’t act yet. If it’s actually actionable, the ticket should be moved into a status that prompts us to act. Visibility and lifecycle statuses are critical to avoid duplication of effort.

High-volume matters: identify what “high volume” constitutes and assign accordingly. We can allocate certain tickets to levels or people. If we get large batches, they should be handled by templated processes. We can create templates in 3E for recurring matter types to reduce involvement. Administrators will create templates and background queries so we can pick up knowledge articles.

Address maintenance: requests to change billing or matter addresses come from the PE. The change may impact all matters or just a single matter. We should handle this carefully; if a client-level change is needed, it affects all matters, so we might prefer matter-level changes unless the client-level change is requested and approved. The system should include address lines, ZIP/postal code fields, and country so entries are consistent. Duplicates are an issue; if an address already exists in the system we will point to it.

Urgency and SLAs: urgency is often misused and becomes white noise. We need a clear prioritization model with definitions (P1, response in X hours). This requires a separate conversation with OPS to agree on service commitments and SLAs. A drop-down on priority should be defined and constrained with clear consequences and expectations. We have to be careful; VIP labels are often overused and subjective. We’ll set objective criteria for priority.

Rates work: there are regular panel agreements and rate cards to manage. Panel requests can come from global commercial teams, PEs, or ShareWell. Rate cards can include multiple locations and rate classes. We should require effective dates and references, and ideally the request should include which client numbers should be applied. We can validate rates against bands and standards so they can't be entered incorrectly. Some rates are global standard rates, some are local; we need a structure that enforces maximums and allowable ranges.

When rates are changed at client level, recalculation happens in 3E and downstream impacts should be communicated back to the requester. For example, changes may not immediately impact billing; we need to explain what will happen next. The PE remains responsible for checking downstream impact.

Standard rate queries: many queries are simple (what are the rates?) and some are complex and can take a day or more. We should create a pick list of common queries and knowledge articles so the requester can self-serve where possible. This will reduce low-value tickets and speed up responses. For more complex queries, the pick list can route to the appropriate team or person.

Volume discounts and rebates: there are different types of volume discounts — percentage discounts on bills, rebates or credits for a period, tiered discounts based on thresholds. Typically the partner or account manager identifies and negotiates these. The Rama team sets these up in the system, often after reporting identifies thresholds being met. We need a tracking process to capture the discount agreement, engagement letter, effective dates, and how adjustments should be applied. Reporting needs to be integrated into the workflow so teams are aware when thresholds are reached and who is accountable.

Ownership and tracking: multiple teams can raise requests — reporting, Rama, PE, global commercial — so we need visibility and routing so all relevant teams get an FYI when a volume discount is created or amended. A notification when the ticket is closed should go to all stakeholders. There may be a global assignment group and a skill matrix to manage assignments. The lifecycle should be visible to all three groups (Rama, reporting, PES), and the request should show who will do the actual work.

Matter creation and billable setup: sometimes we create matters on behalf of PEs; we capture necessary fields and return the matter number. The team that creates the matter also ensures billing teams are notified and that any downstream tasks — such as financial assistance or e-billing tasks — are routed to the appropriate team. Some tasks are country-specific (Australia vs UK), and some countries handle billing tasks locally.

Timecards and transfers: timecard splits and transfers are also a request type. If a user needs a timecard split, that can be a form which routes to the Fences or Hub team. Fences use ServiceDeskPlus; as we migrate, they will be brought into ServiceNow. The portal should allow staff without ServiceNow access to submit requests by email or a specific mailbox. We need clarity on who handles timecard transfers and validations.

Templates and knowledge capture: create templates in 3E for common matter types and recurring tasks to reduce manual effort. Knowledge articles should be available to users to self-serve for standard queries. The system should present relevant knowledge articles at the point the user is submitting a request.

SLA reporting and MI: we should track SLAs and have dashboards to monitor task age, pending QA items, and high-volume work. This will help with capacity planning and with highlighting backlog issues. We aim for timely completion of small tasks (e.g., within 4 hours), but working hours and submitted times affect SLAs. Urgency flags must be used carefully.

Next steps and wrap-up: we have a lot of stories and categories to capture. We should group them: managed matters, rate issues, address maintenance, new matter creation, payer updates, panel agreements, volume discounts, timecards, and high-volume tasks. We need checklists for common live checks and to capture required fields (e.g., effective date, primary matter, currency, partner approval). We’ll create forms with validations to reduce rework.

Action items: build knowledge articles for standard rate queries, create templates for frequent matters in 3E, define priority and SLA models with OPS, formalize ownership for volume discounts and approvals, and ensure compliance-generated tickets include all necessary fields to trigger downstream actions. We’ll capture and prioritize the stories for the next sprint cycles and aim to build the foundation first.

Thank you — this has been very helpful. I’ll take these notes and park items into client, matter, and rate categories. We’ll review the technical implications, the training/smarter user experience, and the workflow ownership next.
