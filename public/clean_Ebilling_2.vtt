Yeah — people who don’t want to agree. There was recently a social group, a very top-line group, who know what it is but never travelled together. Because somebody — yeah. Two. OK.

Mhm. Yeah. OK. So… sure. OK. It’s me. It’s fine. That’s why, apart from this, I think anybody can talk to mushrooms. So where was the change? The sign on the sides — it’s not going down several times. I’m the official… it was taxed. I can’t… of the income reserved pallet places — it’s based on the wall. If you put it, you know, these things pushing at the signage. Did you forget to go out? No. I forgot what it was about — six children. But yeah, she’s… It’s not your childhood. We are returning to the room. Did you watch your… Very good. No worries. Have you got a charge on? Yes. Oh cool. I’m still hearing you scrambling. Did you say that you bought some food? Yeah, to get everything in there. It’s a lot, actually. The original — don’t know what you’re going to need. I didn’t bring a big suitcase; I thought this one was big. I’ll go for it tomorrow and get some time. A bit on the way back maybe. Is it called Fire Mix? No, I’m looking at it. That was my question.

OK — still showing as recording, Josh. Yep, looks good. We’re OK to start. I didn’t realize you weren’t moving it — it moved as people spoke. So we have shut SolidTail down.

Shall we get into invoices? After a bit of prioritization, a quick look at some recommended dashboards and reports. This is probably the last real session. There are quite a few processes; I know you wanted to try and consolidate. I had a look at your invoice upload process. As a service, we recommend that invoices essentially follow a scenario from receipt to date. As we talk through it, within that service you can get a new workflow and maybe a rejection process. There was a portal. You might say that’s outside the scope, but consolidation is the objective.

Start from the initial receipt. When I’d seen it before, it seemed to provide some structure. From your skill set there could be some auto-assignment depending on team members, if you need that. That’s something you can start with. So you’ve got invoice management. Is that a fair summary of the entry criteria and dependencies where clients are active? The happy-path presumably is that the service checks the client is not deactivated or closed, so we’re not getting invoices for inactive companies. That check happens first. Then it’s sent and received as a group — is that fair to say? Probably. From that process… I might have made it sound like it’s one invoice per client. It could be one client, multiple invoices — that’s better to say: clients may submit multiple invoices or invoices for partners. It really depends on the setup, and the service could handle that.

Each task would be for a client. You might enter a value, a total, or they enter the invoice value. Then you’ve got some reconciliation. You could request “add another” and have a clear association so you don’t have to scroll through the email PDF and naming conventions. Your pain point is having to download, whereas a service could download all and attach as needed. The service could also collect multiple units into one request; it could end up in different workflows and then into client-per-request handling.

So the request would include client name and invoice numbers. We want to pull some of that automatically and take care of special cases. At the moment we see an uploaded invoice and then have to go into the PDF. You want the value for quick reference — any currency — so you can refer and flag anomalies by requester. We need some identifier: a matter ID or a PO. If we don’t have it, we can’t progress the invoice. Often you just get a PDF and can’t do anything. PO or matter references differ by client.

Would you have a dropdown or free text for reference? Free text is often alphanumeric; some clients like eBay or managing bureaus may have different formats. Without a mandatory reference field you can’t progress; it adds days or weeks to process — it can take a month if they don’t send it.

Requesters should be able to save a draft. Parik, is there a way to do a save-as-draft so requesters can save incomplete submissions and come back to them? Parik: Yes, that’s fine. We can have mandatory fields to complete and then allow saving post-saving but pre-submission. So you can have minimal mandatory information, save the record, and then complete before final submission.

One concern: e-billing reference numbers are often free-text. You don’t want people to put “TBC” and loop forever. You can structure fields with validation rules. For example, if an e-billing number is known to be a 16-digit number with an “E” prefix, you can define rules. But you have over 400 clients with different reference patterns, so it’s complex. Validation is helpful only if the data is actually entered correctly; people can still enter dots or dashes. You might make the field mandatory but allow some bypass for exceptional cases. Start with open patterns, monitor reports and dashboards, and then block common placeholders like “TBC” or “N/A” over time. You can use recommended pop-ups and confirm boxes to drive the right behavior.

For request fields you mentioned order number per invoice and attachments. You could have a “same for all” option or a dropdown to avoid free-text issues. Client active status ties back to client onboarding. If you have a trusted source for client data — CRM — that should feed into the drop-down and then into other processes. You asked about subsidiaries and vendor onboarding — in principle you can onboard clients and subsidiaries and avoid duplicated pretext. Pulling trusted client data from CRM is a good idea, but you shouldn’t rely solely on CRM; it should be a combination of CRM and other sources. We’ll take that back as a parking item and involve the governance team (JP’s owners) to define the source of truth.

We landed on: multiple invoices, one client, or multiple clients per request is supported. For the over-100K flag, you can have a checkbox that picks up large values. Do you want it for any single invoice over 100,000 or when the total of invoices in a request exceeds 100,000? Probably both: either a single invoice over a threshold or the cumulative total exceeding a threshold. You can implement both checks and date range filters for aging.

You want to track invoice date so you can report on aging. The request record should include the oldest invoice date if multiple invoices are submitted, so you can prioritize e.g. anything over six months old. That should be a filterable field.

Regarding recurring invoices and monthly invoicing: consider a service that expects recurring invoices so requesters know to provide necessary information at submission. You could handle recurring invoices proactively by managing them as scheduled uploads, but be aware it might create a lot of work and notifications for requesters. Possibly manage recurring invoices as an agreed service rather than rely on requesters to resubmit each time.

Access — can anybody in e-billing pick up an upload? Yes, the team can follow-the-sun: Asia, Brisbane, etc. You can have conditional reassignment based on location or skills. Anyone in the team can pick up tasks; it should be available globally. You will have SLA/buying limits and skill matrices, and regional finance offices and associates should have visibility. You also mentioned VIP clients; you can flag them and have specific handling.

Workflow: think of onboarding like a portal workflow. Requests are uploaded, validated, and can be accepted or rejected. You’ll want activities against each record: uploaded, rejected with action required, accepted and completed. Rejection reasons should be picklist values to allow reporting: budget not approved, matter not signed on portal, client rejected, rejected by us, rejected by timekeeper, etc. Those work notes are important and should be captured. Rejections may require pushing back to the PE (partner or timekeeper) for more information.

Portal will do client approval heavy lifting but client rejections can still occur at multiple points. If pre-checks and approvals are done well, your internal rejection rate should be reduced. We don’t currently see the approvals or consumption of budgets — that’s something to capture upstream. Capturing client entity and billing entity is important — we don’t see this currently and often have to reject to get the correct entity. It looks like a data entry issue when clients are set up incorrectly.

Free-text comments are useful. Add a free-form comments field to capture additional insights. Agents can use it to flag that they are awaiting timekeeper approval, for example. However, manage workflow states rather than rely on free text for tracking status. Comments can be reported on and searched later for keyword analysis.

So, to recap the workflow: upload → live check → peer check (approver task) → post-check → submission to portal. The peer check should include a checklist and return to the original submitter if corrective action is required. Live checks can be handled by an approver task with the checklist included.

We need to differentiate auto-submit uploads from manual submissions. QA needs to sample and differentiate whether a request was auto-submitted or manually uploaded. The record should indicate if it was auto-submitted, who or what submitted it, and confirmation of submission. Post-submission, there should be a post-check or sampling process. Even if a submission is auto-submitted, it can still be rejected later, so you need to link subsequent rejection records rather than opening new tickets every time. Link associated records for audit and history.

On rejection handling: capture rejection reasons in a picklist and allow branching activities based on reason. Have core categories (e.g., incorrect data, missing PO, wrong value) and an “other” free-text field. You should be able to report on iterations — how many times a record has been rejected and resubmitted — and perform root cause analysis. That will help identify where process improvements are needed and reduce repeated loops.

Timing: portal rejections are almost instant; client-side responses might take days. You need to decide whether a record, once “closed complete,” should remain uneditable. If rejections come in later, they should create linked follow-on records rather than reopen the original. This keeps audit trails clear and avoids risk of changing historical data.

Credit control: we still use a manual e-bill tracker and spreadsheets. Credit control has fields for uploaded, rejected, on-hold, invoice date, date sent, etc. We can consider integrating credit control fields into the new process and reduce reliance on spreadsheets. Credit control runs their own sessions and needs visibility to know whether an invoice has been uploaded, rejected, or is held. That’s something to explore as a parking item.

Notifications and mailbox volume: you get daily updates from portals, including delivery notifications and changes. This volume is noisy and hard to manage. We need suppression rules to reduce cases created for unimportant notifications. Some notifications are important (approved, projected paid), others are unnecessary. You can use subject matching, sender matching, or other rules to suppress or route notifications. Parik, Mark, Jones — we’ll qualify which notifications are useful and create suppression rules. It’s unlikely we’ll stop 100% of noise because portals are controlled externally, but we can reduce and refine.

Portals: clients run many third-party portals and configure them differently. Some portals are efficient; others are a mess. We need to accept that “e-billing” often includes many inefficient third-party integrations. For recurring or subscription fees that come via portal, those tend to go to AP for periodic checks and authorization. Subscription uploads can be treated as a separate AP process with a monthly/periodic check.

Automation and rate validations (Lauren’s demo): we take two sets of data — extracted portal data and 3E data — and combine them. The time, currency, hours, work type, and work rate are compared to a standard reference. The automation creates tickets for discrepancies (e.g., rate must be updated). The automation is done with Automation Anywhere — it creates an individual ticket for each spreadsheet row where validation fails. It helps catch rate mismatches before invoice submission. This reduces reissues and prevents incorrect invoices being processed. The process pulls data from 3E and the portal, then validates rates and creates tickets for manual review if discrepancies are found. It’s quite heavy in volume: thousands of rows across many offices. It saves significant hours — a recent run saved about 250 hours by focusing on rate mismatches and capturing rejection reasons proactively.

Client requirements matrix: you have a matrix that lists client ID, client name, expected date, billing cycles, mandatory fields (matter ID, LMN number), PDF preferences, chargeable disbursements, who manages submission type, and so on. This matrix is used to validate invoice submissions and make sure they comply with client-specific requirements. It’s important to keep this matrix updated because rates and requirements change (often on the 1st of the month). You want a single source — ideally a knowledge article in ServiceNow — so teams don’t have to keep asking who has the most recent version.

Ownership: the client setup is part of onboarding and should flow from CRM and 3E. Often the onboarding information is inconsistent and grows over time with free-text entries. We should standardize this and capture requirements in a knowledge base. Present knowledge to requesters in the portal so they can self-serve and avoid submitting cases. ServiceNow’s intelligent search/knowledge features can help surface the right articles before a ticket is raised.

Actionable next steps: collect all the client requirements documents, upload them to a shared area, and analyze them. Align with Hannah and the content team to ensure client-facing material is branded and consistent. We will compile notes and actions from today, create user stories, and prioritize automation opportunities.

Prioritization: invoice processing is a heavy-volume activity and should be prioritized for automation where feasible. We’ll estimate impacts (e.g., manage invoice, client accruals, billing queries) and prioritize the most impactful automations. Dashboards: create operational dashboards for aging by type, rejection rates, status for requesters, and leadership dashboards for upstream metrics. Requesters frequently ask “where is my invoice?” — provide self-service visibility to reduce queries.

Workshops and follow-up: we have workshops this week with finance and will discuss what’s possible. We’ll confirm notes and actions and send follow-up by Thursday or Friday. If needed, we’ll schedule another session the following week.

Miscellaneous items covered:
- Capture peer checks and include checklists in approver tasks.
- Clearly mark auto-submit vs manual submit on records for sampling and QA.
- Capture rejection history and iterations for root cause analysis.
- Link follow-on records to original tickets when dealing with subsequent rejections.
- Consider suppression rules for noisy portal notifications and refine them iteratively.
- Continue to maintain the client requirements matrix and publish it as a knowledge article.
- Use automation (Automation Anywhere) to validate rates and flag discrepancies before submission.
- Engage the governance team for source-of-truth decisions and CRM integration.

That covers the session. We’ll consolidate the notes, build the stories, and come back with proposals and dashboards. Thanks everyone — good work. Thanks. Bye.
