START OF BILLING CONVERSATION PART 2:

You trigger it daily — invoices. I'm not sure of the exact path, but the assignment group will always be yourself. It's been worked kind of into the process. There is another person in Jordan involved, but at the moment it's you. Morgan does get requests; they all fall under one partner and that could be split with another person. Typically they are straightforward fees in terms of actual billing, but they are slightly different because they're bigger matters. OK, that'll be an opportunity to have a look at.

I think we've got queries as well that are critical for the skills matrix. Do you put general queries in, Tim? The ones near the top are probably the initial support items — simple "can you help me?" types that should be addressed by the knowledge base so they don't land with you. There will always be one that slips through, and you're willing to help transfer those. These are the sorts of things we want captured in knowledge so users can self-serve. Anything we have today will form part of that knowledge base.

Yes, that's good. If something matches the keywords they're typing, it should surface what's available. They might not use it, but as Deborah said, it's to save effort. We use it as a gating process so users can find what they need themselves. It gives them knowledge and reduces unnecessary requests.

Regarding practice finance: that comes in as a report for Citigroup's monthly billing and sits under complex billing. Is it the same with JP Morgan where you're doing it monthly for them? If so, that could be scheduled as part of a workflow that touches other teams, or it could be sheer volume that requires manual intervention. The raised bill sometimes has to go to a couple of other teams, ultimately to... which teams does it go to? I think those others come under finance or legal — maybe a finance team. I always email Andrew or Christian about these. They tend to handle it outside of the normal workflow.

The monthly billing process for that client is audited and checked. There are lots of reports. Are those just prompts for you, or actual reports? For Citibank, one says it's scheduled but I don't think it is on share; I think it's only RTB. It's not something you can really schedule internally in the same way. You don't get asked to do them again. We could create calendar events to increase transparency across the whole team so you know what's complete.

Do those reports create tasks, or are they actual reports that come in from finance? The daily billing one comes in from finance — that's the audit check on the PEs. They do that in-house. That check just sits there, you do it, and then it's logged. A separate monthly one gets created when finance sends us a report; we go in and reconcile everything. When you're marking that the PEs are okay, you're not just marking homework — you're generating metrics so we can identify people who might need extra training. We can feed those metrics back.

We're mainly checking that the report matches the matter and client details. For example, is that UK bill applied correctly? We check defaults such as client VAT settings. Sometimes things in the system are missed. If a billing item hasn't been applied correctly, we would go back to the PE. From a system perspective, it sounds like we need a workflow here: when you're going to send something back, who gets notified and why? If there was an error, should they be notified at that point? Some might not want a notification, but it could be useful — for example, when information is updated.

You wouldn't just update the VAT and leave it — last year we sorted something and if they hadn't come back to us we'd have chased them. There needs to be a task rather than just a check-and-ignore. If it goes back to the PE, we'd expect them to action it, but we seem a little unclear on that process. They should get a notification; otherwise five months down the line it might not be resolved.

Every day there are issues that might mean different PEs are creating requests. Too many PEs are doing billing on their own; some days it's inconsistent and iterative. Could we have a request that you can then assign to someone on your team to do a daily check on the reports and issues? For example, if there are multiple matters with particular issues, perhaps one daily request could be created for the team to triage.

In Australia, PEs do their billing and the daily check happens there. They have easier access so it's simpler for them, whereas we tend to do more of the reconciliation step. When finance sends reports automatically into IT systems, we act on them. We already have some scheduled report processes and calendar events to capture actions, which is why I put it under general queries.

The scheduling item can go into the parking lot because multiple teams are involved. There are a few invoices in the general query tab — matters like card narrative, transferring time, purging time, write-offs. We talked about checking time for investment funds yesterday. I'm not sure I'm part of that process at the beginning, but I can pick it up and check whether rates of a matter are captured and whether it routes to rates of matter or something else. I'll check that one, including special exceptions we discussed yesterday.

There are obviously many queries and a lot of activity involved in managing that service for billing. We need to go away and write the user stories for billing so we can bring everything together to your view. You've touched on e-billing crossover; we don't have a formal handshake between them yet, but that should all be streamlined into workflows. Easier said than done, but we want an efficient way so you're not managing paper work manually.

Do you have any other questions? This is the beginning. For request subjects, if someone marks an invoice as urgent in the subject heading, we don't want to overcomplicate the form, but we do want to capture key metrics. For example, if they state the actual amount — whether it's a million or only 20 — capture that. These are the types of metrics we want them to complete so we know what the request is about. Also capture timing, like "needs to be billed by the end of the week" — that helps us schedule work, rather than everything getting pushed to the end of the month.

We can target dates and effective dates in the form so we can start to pick up and prioritize things. That should work; you can set realistic targets like first week, second week, etc., rather than everything on the fourth week or month-end.

We'll share data with you so that as you use the system you'll get more insight into workloads, case states, and what's high priority. Dashboards can show team leads how to allocate work. We're hoping to use some automated dashboards so you get transparency across the team — who's busy, who's not. Ideally, include complex billing and the rest of the team, so coverage exists if someone is away.

ServiceNow will allow filtering across different groups of items and toggling between tabs so you can review different queues. It helps you plan your day: inbox items, dashboards, and reports that show your workload. Start with a solid base and foundation; as you have additional requirements we can build those in. Reports should start answering key questions — e.g., how many invoices are in a given state today. ServiceNow can deliver those insights.

We also touched on knowledge management — creating articles so employees and PEs can quickly find answers rather than engaging the service desk. That will help drive adoption and reduce manual requests.

We understand dependencies on other teams and will start to build those into the backlog. We'll capture the requirements for the sprint backlog and think about dependencies and standing items. I've captured a couple of overarching change impacts: managing billing requests in the new system, and the cultural shift for PEs and partners to move from ad hoc notes to using a formal tool. That will be a big mindset change; partners are used to doing things their way.

We'll work with certain groups and PEs to demonstrate benefits and encourage them to fill in the forms. That should support their adoption journey. Other impacts include the operating model change, responsibilities in Australia, skills and knowledge guides to streamline bill amendments, and partners taking more responsibility to help reduce workload on your team. You're keen on moving complex communication and tracking to ServiceNow as well — that impact will be captured.

If there's anything else you think I need to capture for your team, let me know. We'll roll these items up into a Change Impact report that shows how ServiceNow will affect various themes. I'll send that report to you after writing up all the finance workshops. When you review it, if there are processes or impacts to add or if I've captured specific ways of working incorrectly, we can update it.

Quick timeline: we've done some design already. February 27 is when we need an opportunity to finalize requirements. By the beginning of June we'll aim to have the build complete. Then we'll start testing with stakeholders and aim for a go-live in a few key days around that window.

Regarding rates of matter and change in behavior: there are multiple requests where a standard rate card could answer common questions. That knowledge article could exist now rather than waiting until later, and it might start changing behavior immediately. Once we get the user stories into the backlog and have you, Sandeep, and others review them, we can start the build. The build will be iterative — you don't have to wait until the end to sign off. There will be drops you can review and tweak.

That sounds right. We'll have an opportunity to make tweaks. We should finish workshops next week, then expect to see the first output in one to two weeks after that. Please flag any BAU conflicts and avoid end-of-month handovers where possible. We need to keep the momentum and manage the team's availability. Sandeep and others will help coordinate that.

Any other questions? In other clients I've seen, running retrospectives and bringing in change saves with the program team twice can be helpful. This isn't the end — if anything comes to mind later, please send feedback. Thank you for your time. I appreciate it.

Thanks, everyone. Should we grab anything else? Thank you. Cheers. Thank you. (Meeting continues.)
