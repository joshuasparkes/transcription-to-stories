<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/13-0
00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:40.651
<v Marwan Altaie>Yep,

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/13-1

<v Marwan Altaie>their conversations. That's fine.
That's fine.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/13-2

with design, thanks for joining us.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/13-3
00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.752
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't think there's anyone actually on
the teams meeting at the moment,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/13-4
00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:53.521
<v Marwan Altaie>which is fine.
So we're going to screen record and we</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/13-5
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:55.777

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/16-0
00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:03.548
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry Parrot Parrot's on the call. Cool.
So let's get started.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/16-1
00:01:03.548 --> 00:01:07.742
<v Marwan Altaie>Apologies about the lack of snacks.
We will get you snacks at some point.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/16-2
00:01:07.742 --> 00:01:11.540
<v Marwan Altaie>I I I heard the formal complaints. No, no,
I heard the complaints.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/16-3
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.337
<v Marwan Altaie>I agree with the complaints.
We will get you snacks at some point.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/19-0
00:01:22.177 --> 00:01:25.432
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.
So this is just a summary of what we went</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/19-1
00:01:25.432 --> 00:01:28.959
<v Marwan Altaie>through last week.
Josh and Deborah LED really good</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/19-2
00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:32.418
<v Marwan Altaie>workshops,
I think addressing all of the E billing</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/19-3
00:01:32.418 --> 00:01:35.537
<v Marwan Altaie>house payable,
cash sharing rates and matter.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/20-0
00:01:35.577 --> 00:01:39.632
<v Marwan Altaie>And billing and this is just to show that
we're not doing it segmented.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/20-1
00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:43.687
<v Marwan Altaie>So I'm leading credit control and with
and expenses today and tomorrow.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/20-2
00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:47.630
<v Marwan Altaie>But we will be working well.
I'll be working with Josh and Deborah to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/20-3
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.854
<v Marwan Altaie>create a end to end solution and
hopefully there's no questions. But yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/20-4
00:01:51.854 --> 00:01:55.177
<v Marwan Altaie>we will be or I'm assuming Azure will be
splitting a time.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/21-0
00:01:55.257 --> 00:01:59.246
<v Marwan Altaie>Between credit control and WIP and
connect today and the same with expenses</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/21-1
00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:02.553
<v Marwan Altaie>and client tomorrow.
But if we need to circulate this meeting,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/21-2
00:02:02.553 --> 00:02:05.021
<v Marwan Altaie>we can.
Everything's being recorded and we can</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/21-3
00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:08.957
<v Marwan Altaie>include whoever needs to see afterwards.
This is just a high level agenda.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/21-4
00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:11.057
<v Marwan Altaie>So we're gonna go through introductions.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/22-0
00:02:11.257 --> 00:02:14.958
<v Marwan Altaie>Roughly what we're going to be doing in
terms of structure objectives and then</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/22-1
00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.019
<v Marwan Altaie>we're going to review credit control
first.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/22-2
00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.017
<v Marwan Altaie>So I'm prioritising credit control simply
because there's more.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/23-0
00:02:22.177 --> 00:02:22.417
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/25-0
00:02:25.097 --> 00:02:28.471
<v Marwan Altaie>So we're going to prioritise credit
control because without integrations</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/25-1
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:31.613
<v Marwan Altaie>there is for in my opinion a good
solution we can review and we can</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/25-2
00:02:31.613 --> 00:02:34.062
<v Marwan Altaie>implement,
whereas whip we're spending slightly less</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/25-3
00:02:34.062 --> 00:02:37.436
<v Marwan Altaie>time on simply because there is a limit
based on a lack of integrations.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/25-4
00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:40.024
<v Marwan Altaie>But we'll go through and we'll discuss
what's feasible,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/25-5
00:02:40.024 --> 00:02:43.489
<v Marwan Altaie>what's not feasible and the benefits of
you know going through that change</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/25-6
00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.737
<v Marwan Altaie>management and introducing.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/27-0
00:02:44.857 --> 00:02:47.938
<v Marwan Altaie>To begin with,
or if it's going to be more hassle than</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/27-1
00:02:47.938 --> 00:02:51.468
<v Marwan Altaie>it's worth, so more one,
I'll tie on the ServiceNow functional</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/27-2
00:02:51.468 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Marwan Altaie>leads and I will be focusing, like I said,
on credit control with and expenses,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/27-3
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.151
<v Marwan Altaie>but I'll probably be involved in a little
bit of everything at this point,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/27-4
00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:04.577
<v Marwan Altaie>ensuring that you get a good end to end
solution that has everyone cashiering.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/29-0
00:03:05.337 --> 00:03:08.321
<v Marwan Altaie>Credit control credit managers and,
you know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/29-1
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:13.187
<v Marwan Altaie>deliver in line with the expectations.
So that's me. Who wants to go next?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/29-2
00:03:13.187 --> 00:03:16.690

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.377
<v Marwan Altaie>Looking at the end to end.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/30-0
00:03:20.297 --> 00:03:24.061

team leader,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/32-1
00:03:35.993 --> 00:03:41.821
<v Marwan Altaie>based in Glasgow and we go out to the
business and try to tackle significant</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/32-2
00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:46.817
<v Marwan Altaie>balances and age balances and create a
better pathway to billing.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/33-0
00:03:47.177 --> 00:03:47.297
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/34-0
00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:52.125

And I'm Chris living.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/34-1
00:03:52.125 --> 00:03:55.767
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm the revenue manager.
I look after the whip and credit control</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/34-2
00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:59.685
<v Marwan Altaie>teams in Brisbane and Glasgow. Anna,
I'm finance operations manager in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/34-3
00:03:59.685 --> 00:04:03.989
<v Marwan Altaie>Australia, looking after cashiers and AP.
But cashiers work very closely with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/34-4
00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:04.817
<v Marwan Altaie>credit control.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/35-0
00:04:07.537 --> 00:04:10.254
<v Marwan Altaie>One thing to say sorry,
this is sorry hadn't occurred to me.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/35-1
00:04:10.254 --> 00:04:13.016
<v Marwan Altaie>I did thought Martin was going to be in
our sessions all day,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/35-2
00:04:13.016 --> 00:04:16.268
<v Marwan Altaie>but we need Martin to do the credit
control bit because he's covering UK</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/35-3
00:04:16.268 --> 00:04:19.609
<v Marwan Altaie>cashier's side. So is it better?
Could we throw it around and do whip very</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/35-4
00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.257
<v Marwan Altaie>quickly now because we've got Kirsty?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/36-0
00:04:21.737 --> 00:04:24.613
<v Marwan Altaie>Or. Or would you prefer to?
I mean we could try and mother through</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/36-1
00:04:24.613 --> 00:04:26.888
<v Marwan Altaie>that master,
and if we need to come back to it later</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/36-2
00:04:26.888 --> 00:04:27.017
<v Marwan Altaie>or.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/37-0
00:04:34.057 --> 00:04:37.097
<v Marwan Altaie>We could probably muddle through,
but I don't know how the the bike is,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/37-1
00:04:37.097 --> 00:04:40.094
<v Marwan Altaie>we just don't know between us.
That's fine. Let's let's do whip first.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/37-2
00:04:40.094 --> 00:04:43.261
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. No, no.
That's completely throwing off my whole</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/37-3
00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:45.667
<v Marwan Altaie>meeting. It's fine. Yeah,
we'll we'll we'll do whip 1st.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/37-4
00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:48.960
<v Marwan Altaie>And because whips a smaller section,
we can probably have a break afterwards.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/37-5
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.451
<v Marwan Altaie>And hopefully Martin will come back on
maybe eleven 11:30.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/37-6
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:53.857
<v Marwan Altaie>If someone wants to drop a message,
he's definitely out.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/38-0
00:04:54.057 --> 00:04:57.383
<v Marwan Altaie>This morning I'm hoping it'll be back on
this afternoon and dialling in by teams.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/38-1
00:04:57.383 --> 00:04:59.695
<v Marwan Altaie>Worst case scenario,
if we do need cashiering decisions,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/38-2
00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:02.696
<v Marwan Altaie>we can set them aside as parking lot
items, we can define the rest of it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/38-3
00:05:02.696 --> 00:05:05.981
<v Marwan Altaie>We can define credit control decisions,
approvals and then just think that's the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/38-4
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:08.577
<v Marwan Altaie>best way to deal with it. Yeah,
that's fine. It's not an issue.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/39-0
00:05:09.737 --> 00:05:13.247
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's like I could probably just depend
too busy here. Are you?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/39-1
00:05:13.247 --> 00:05:16.545
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't know any of that.
Any cashiers come in on? OK Monday.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/39-2
00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:20.481
<v Marwan Altaie>So usually Tuesday. Wednesday. OK.
But I look, I'll be with them Tuesday,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/39-3
00:05:20.481 --> 00:05:23.140
<v Marwan Altaie>Wednesday.
So I can always do executive decisions</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/39-4
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.257
<v Marwan Altaie>with a question mark.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/40-0
00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:25.577
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/41-0
00:05:34.297 --> 00:05:34.537
<v Marwan Altaie>MTA.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/42-0
00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:41.933
<v Marwan Altaie>So we've skipped ahead. It's not 3:00 yet,
unfortunately. So whip.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/42-1
00:05:41.933 --> 00:05:47.599
<v Marwan Altaie>I've had a discussion with Chris.
We've agreed that I'll go briefly through</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/42-2
00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:53.713
<v Marwan Altaie>some of the kind of data points and roles
that I think are just worth discussing,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/42-3
00:05:53.713 --> 00:05:55.577
<v Marwan Altaie>agreeing if we can stand.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/43-0
00:05:55.817 --> 00:05:58.725
<v Marwan Altaie>Potentially,
but you will be leading the kind of as is</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/43-1
00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:01.633
<v Marwan Altaie>for the most part,
and ServiceNow would benefit. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/43-2
00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:04.646
<v Marwan Altaie>I think and this is more from anywhere
else in the room,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/43-3
00:06:04.646 --> 00:06:08.981
<v Marwan Altaie>the whip function is very new and there's
probably not a lot of knowledge in this</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/43-4
00:06:08.981 --> 00:06:11.466
<v Marwan Altaie>room and in the firm of what the whip
team do.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/43-5
00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:15.114
<v Marwan Altaie>So I thought it was just slightly
changing and me giving us maybe 30</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/43-6
00:06:15.114 --> 00:06:15.537
<v Marwan Altaie>seconds.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/44-0
00:06:15.617 --> 00:06:18.609
<v Marwan Altaie>One minute, 2 minutes.
Sort of high high level process overview</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/44-1
00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:22.349
<v Marwan Altaie>of what they actually do and how they
actually work and then it goes to kind of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/44-2
00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.621
<v Marwan Altaie>explain how potentially we could use
ServiceNow to help support that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/44-3
00:06:25.621 --> 00:06:29.174
<v Marwan Altaie>Just see the best slightly better
approach because because they are new and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/44-4
00:06:29.174 --> 00:06:31.137
<v Marwan Altaie>because the process is slightly different.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/45-0
00:06:31.817 --> 00:06:34.067
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.
So I'm just gonna go through the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/45-1
00:06:34.067 --> 00:06:36.663
<v Marwan Altaie>assumption.
So unfortunately at this moment,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/45-2
00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:41.279
<v Marwan Altaie>the assumption there's no integrations of
course further down the line we might</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/45-3
00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:44.567
<v Marwan Altaie>have integrations we might be able to
bring in new data.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/45-4
00:06:44.567 --> 00:06:48.317
<v Marwan Altaie>But at this moment in time,
that's the assumption and that's the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/45-5
00:06:48.317 --> 00:06:49.817
<v Marwan Altaie>solution we're going with.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/46-0
00:06:50.457 --> 00:06:54.564
<v Marwan Altaie>And for the majority of this whip,
it's just understanding is my mic echoing</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/46-1
00:06:54.564 --> 00:06:57.390
<v Marwan Altaie>or is it? There's a little bit,
let me move it down.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/46-2
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.337
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't know if you're in your own voice
and then making it echo as well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/46-3
00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:05.177
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that better? Cool. So yeah,
just understanding that as is processed,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/46-4
00:07:05.177 --> 00:07:08.857
<v Marwan Altaie>we're not going in too much depth because
based on my understanding,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/46-5
00:07:08.857 --> 00:07:09.817
<v Marwan Altaie>you have majority.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/47-0
00:07:09.937 --> 00:07:12.699
<v Marwan Altaie>Of your operations and your processes in
place already,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/47-1
00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:16.251
<v Marwan Altaie>you have a lot of shared drives.
A lot of system process away exporting</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/47-2
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:20.246
<v Marwan Altaie>reports. You're making those changes.
You're emailing who you need to e-mail to,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/47-3
00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:23.502
<v Marwan Altaie>and we don't want to add. Yeah,
if it adds admin without benefit,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/47-4
00:07:23.502 --> 00:07:27.448
<v Marwan Altaie>there's no point because no one's going
to use it, so probably leave it to you,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/47-5
00:07:27.448 --> 00:07:28.977
<v Marwan Altaie>Chris. Yep, no worries. OK, so.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/48-0
00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:32.911
<v Marwan Altaie>They said the whip team are a relatively
new function.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/48-1
00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:35.893
<v Marwan Altaie>They've been around probably about a year
and a bit,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/48-2
00:07:35.893 --> 00:07:38.593
<v Marwan Altaie>but we've actually been easing into
operations.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/48-3
00:07:38.593 --> 00:07:42.137
<v Marwan Altaie>The team gradually expanded as a firm,
we carry a lot of whip.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/48-4
00:07:42.137 --> 00:07:45.737
<v Marwan Altaie>So for with the dose of that don't know
is is time that is put.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/49-0
00:07:46.097 --> 00:07:48.762
<v Marwan Altaie>On the clock by our lawyers,
by our fee earners,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/49-1
00:07:48.762 --> 00:07:53.168
<v Marwan Altaie>so they record their time into intact
time. That time goes, gets loaded into 3A,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/49-2
00:07:53.168 --> 00:07:56.159
<v Marwan Altaie>consecrated.
We sit there with a vast amount of whips.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/49-3
00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:58.661
<v Marwan Altaie>Affirm.
Now you would think in an ideal world</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/49-4
00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:02.523
<v Marwan Altaie>that you would build up with during the
month, and then you'd bill it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/49-5
00:08:02.523 --> 00:08:05.297
<v Marwan Altaie>We should be doing that. But in reality,
we can't.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/50-0
00:08:06.417 --> 00:08:11.196
<v Marwan Altaie>We do a lot of say deals on completion
where we might build up a large amount of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/50-1
00:08:11.196 --> 00:08:15.856
<v Marwan Altaie>whip across a number of months and can't
bill it until a certain milestone has</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/50-2
00:08:15.856 --> 00:08:18.511
<v Marwan Altaie>been reached or something else has
happened.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/50-3
00:08:18.511 --> 00:08:22.522
<v Marwan Altaie>Same for court cases we might be in a
court case with someone we're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/50-4
00:08:22.522 --> 00:08:25.177
<v Marwan Altaie>representing one side and we're not able
to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/51-0
00:08:25.297 --> 00:08:29.694
<v Marwan Altaie>Bill, I'll whip until the other side.
Bill. There's again for a reason,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/51-1
00:08:29.694 --> 00:08:34.336
<v Marwan Altaie>for a court reason, for a mandated reason.
We do have bill monthly matters,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/51-2
00:08:34.336 --> 00:08:38.183
<v Marwan Altaie>so it's a bit of a mixed bag across the
across the whole firm.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/51-3
00:08:38.183 --> 00:08:42.764
<v Marwan Altaie>The problem we have as a firm is that
it's very difficult to know how much</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/51-4
00:08:42.764 --> 00:08:44.657
<v Marwan Altaie>we're going to bill each month.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/52-0
00:08:45.097 --> 00:08:49.713
<v Marwan Altaie>So our global CFO will tell you how much
whip we have on a clock globally every</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/52-1
00:08:49.713 --> 00:08:53.406
<v Marwan Altaie>month. It's a vast amount.
What we don't know is how much we're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/52-2
00:08:53.406 --> 00:08:58.253
<v Marwan Altaie>going to build and this is where the whip
team come in. As we have grown as a firm,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/52-3
00:08:58.253 --> 00:09:01.657
<v Marwan Altaie>the level of whip that we're holding has
got a lot bigger.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/53-0
00:09:02.617 --> 00:09:05.135
<v Marwan Altaie>The nature of work that we're taking on
as a firm,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/53-1
00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:08.739
<v Marwan Altaie>we're going towards more corporate M&amp;
A kind of deals. Consequently,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/53-2
00:09:08.739 --> 00:09:11.603
<v Marwan Altaie>they're the type of deals we takes a lot
longer to build.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/53-3
00:09:11.603 --> 00:09:14.812
<v Marwan Altaie>So we have a lot more whip on the clock
and a lot more age whip.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/53-4
00:09:14.812 --> 00:09:16.737
<v Marwan Altaie>So this is where the whip team come in.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/54-0
00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:22.684
<v Marwan Altaie>We have three members of what team in
Glasgow and two in Brisbane,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/54-1
00:09:22.684 --> 00:09:28.347
<v Marwan Altaie>and between them they cover most of the
world with the exception of Asia and they</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/54-2
00:09:28.347 --> 00:09:33.457
<v Marwan Altaie>will reach out to partners or PES who are
practising practise executives.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/55-0
00:09:33.937 --> 00:09:37.863
<v Marwan Altaie>And they will get information on the
matters that contain this whip.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/55-1
00:09:37.863 --> 00:09:40.651
<v Marwan Altaie>Now we have thousands upon thousands of
matters,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/55-2
00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:43.609
<v Marwan Altaie>so they there is a limit to what five
people cover.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/55-3
00:09:43.609 --> 00:09:48.502
<v Marwan Altaie>So they work on a sort of threshold basis.
So they will look at a matter and say, OK,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/55-4
00:09:48.502 --> 00:09:49.697
<v Marwan Altaie>this matter has over.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/56-0
00:09:50.177 --> 00:09:53.096
<v Marwan Altaie>X amount of whip.
We're going to go out to the partner or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/56-1
00:09:53.096 --> 00:09:57.171
<v Marwan Altaie>the PE and we try and find out what's
happening with that whip. So first of all,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/56-2
00:09:57.171 --> 00:09:59.486
<v Marwan Altaie>they'll say just for example,
we've got $500,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/56-3
00:09:59.486 --> 00:10:02.304
<v Marwan Altaie>000 worth of whip on the clock on this
matter. Partner,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/56-4
00:10:02.304 --> 00:10:05.726
<v Marwan Altaie>when are we going to bill it?
And how much are we going to actually</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/56-5
00:10:05.726 --> 00:10:05.977
<v Marwan Altaie>Bill?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/57-0
00:10:06.617 --> 00:10:08.689
<v Marwan Altaie>Because in reality,
although we may have $400,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/57-1
00:10:08.689 --> 00:10:11.289
<v Marwan Altaie>000 worth of whip,
the chances are we're not going to have</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/57-2
00:10:11.289 --> 00:10:13.890
<v Marwan Altaie>to build it all.
We're probably going to build a lot less.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/57-3
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.225
<v Marwan Altaie>So the true value of the whip is we need
to know it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/57-4
00:10:16.225 --> 00:10:18.561
<v Marwan Altaie>and then we also need to know when it's
to be built.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/57-5
00:10:18.561 --> 00:10:21.030
<v Marwan Altaie>There's probably a few other questions
that go into it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/57-6
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.057
<v Marwan Altaie>but that's the sort of general high
overview.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/59-0
00:10:24.377 --> 00:10:28.605
<v Marwan Altaie>Once the team get this information,
they put this into an Excel report.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/59-1
00:10:28.605 --> 00:10:33.421
<v Marwan Altaie>This Excel report has been created for us.
It's called a significant whip report.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/59-2
00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:37.590
<v Marwan Altaie>It's accessed by business managers,
finance managers, finance leaders,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/59-3
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.055
<v Marwan Altaie>senior managers.
It's used for reporting to our ET to mark</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/59-4
00:10:41.055 --> 00:10:42.817
<v Marwan Altaie>to our global CFO and various.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/60-0
00:10:42.977 --> 00:10:46.791
<v Marwan Altaie>Our finance managers to say look,
this is where we're at with our whip. Yes,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/60-1
00:10:46.791 --> 00:10:50.159
<v Marwan Altaie>we've probably got 200 million worth of
whip globally on the clock,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/60-2
00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:53.973
<v Marwan Altaie>but actually we can only probably build
probably 140 million and of which we</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/60-3
00:10:53.973 --> 00:10:56.449
<v Marwan Altaie>could probably build about 50 million
this month.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/60-4
00:10:56.449 --> 00:10:58.777
<v Marwan Altaie>So it kind of gives us a bit of a
snapshot of.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/61-0
00:10:59.017 --> 00:11:02.871
<v Marwan Altaie>But where ours is what our true value of
the whip is.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/61-1
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:06.653
<v Marwan Altaie>The whip team's work also feeds into
credit control,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/61-2
00:11:06.653 --> 00:11:12.006
<v Marwan Altaie>which is why I'd probably cover both
teams in that we shouldn't be raising</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/61-3
00:11:12.006 --> 00:11:15.217
<v Marwan Altaie>bills on the whip until it's ready to
build.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/62-0
00:11:15.777 --> 00:11:19.336
<v Marwan Altaie>Because if we do those bills sit there
for a long time, we can't collect them.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/62-1
00:11:19.336 --> 00:11:21.903
<v Marwan Altaie>So what we should be doing is billing at
the right time,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/62-2
00:11:21.903 --> 00:11:25.057
<v Marwan Altaie>which is what the whip team do,
and then collecting the cash quickly,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/62-3
00:11:25.057 --> 00:11:28.435
<v Marwan Altaie>which is what the credit control team do.
And we'll cover that salt today.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/62-4
00:11:28.435 --> 00:11:31.769
<v Marwan Altaie>So previous project I worked at worked
with in regards to the same thing.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/62-5
00:11:31.769 --> 00:11:35.057
<v Marwan Altaie>We've been credit control and hopefully
where I want you guys to get to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/63-0
00:11:35.377 --> 00:11:38.934
<v Marwan Altaie>It's feasible if we get the integration,
there's a lot of ifs,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/63-1
00:11:38.934 --> 00:11:41.926
<v Marwan Altaie>but what I created was a whip credit
control report,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/63-2
00:11:41.926 --> 00:11:45.708
<v Marwan Altaie>so it would be really simple logic.
Has it been billed? Yes or no?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/63-3
00:11:45.708 --> 00:11:48.926
<v Marwan Altaie>If it's been billed,
has it been approved or has it been</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/63-4
00:11:48.926 --> 00:11:51.297
<v Marwan Altaie>received by the client as in you have one?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/64-0
00:11:51.497 --> 00:11:53.952
<v Marwan Altaie>Stage, or has it been gone through?
Has it been approved?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/64-1
00:11:53.952 --> 00:11:57.380
<v Marwan Altaie>And then you just have a kick off of your
aged buckets and then your thirty 6090</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/64-2
00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.597
<v Marwan Altaie>days where you have your automatic
triggers. It's a really simple solution,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/64-3
00:12:00.597 --> 00:12:03.348
<v Marwan Altaie>but to drive that you do need integration
that you do need data.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/64-4
00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:06.861
<v Marwan Altaie>But hopefully if we can get to that point
then we can kind of define and structure</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/64-5
00:12:06.861 --> 00:12:08.977
<v Marwan Altaie>that we're not doing that at this moment
in time.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/65-0
00:12:09.337 --> 00:12:11.457
<v Marwan Altaie>But that's ideally where you'd want to
get to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/65-1
00:12:11.457 --> 00:12:14.660
<v Marwan Altaie>You have your source system feeding
through to your ServiceNow system,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/65-2
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.592
<v Marwan Altaie>and then your ServiceNow system do it
because it's not feasible.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/65-3
00:12:17.592 --> 00:12:20.839
<v Marwan Altaie>Having that much with matters being dealt
with by what 5-6 people like,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/65-4
00:12:20.839 --> 00:12:24.448
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm assuming that's quite difficult to
stay on top of and yeah, OK, yeah. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/65-5
00:12:24.448 --> 00:12:27.289
<v Marwan Altaie>Look, it absolutely is.
And that's one of the challenges we've</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/65-6
00:12:27.289 --> 00:12:28.417
<v Marwan Altaie>got in the third week of.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/66-0
00:12:29.097 --> 00:12:32.086
<v Marwan Altaie>With a credit controller,
we have three that does the credit</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/66-1
00:12:32.086 --> 00:12:34.829
<v Marwan Altaie>control work.
It's been designed and built to do credit</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/66-2
00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:37.524
<v Marwan Altaie>control, legal works.
That actually works pretty well,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/66-3
00:12:37.524 --> 00:12:40.022
<v Marwan Altaie>but for whatever reason,
when they invented three,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/66-4
00:12:40.022 --> 00:12:43.844
<v Marwan Altaie>they didn't think about the whip side,
which is a pretty big oversight really</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/66-5
00:12:43.844 --> 00:12:46.097
<v Marwan Altaie>for a software that's designed for law
firms.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/67-0
00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:49.335
<v Marwan Altaie>Whether that's coming in the long run,
I don't know.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/67-1
00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:51.609
<v Marwan Altaie>But obviously as you mentioned,
integration is key.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/67-2
00:12:51.609 --> 00:12:54.889
<v Marwan Altaie>And if we're going to move anything,
credit control and and whip into this</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/67-3
00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:58.562
<v Marwan Altaie>service now space there probably needs to
be some kind of integration to really see</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/67-4
00:12:58.562 --> 00:13:00.574
<v Marwan Altaie>the true true benefits.
But hopefully we can,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/67-5
00:13:00.574 --> 00:13:03.592
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll have a look at what,
what we can do with what we've got in the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/67-6
00:13:03.592 --> 00:13:05.297
<v Marwan Altaie>meantime without the integrations just.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/68-0
00:13:06.137 --> 00:13:10.283
<v Marwan Altaie>Just a quick question at the moment.
Where does that reporting data come from?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/68-1
00:13:10.283 --> 00:13:12.907
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean,
I know 3E will have a part to play in it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/68-2
00:13:12.907 --> 00:13:17.053
<v Marwan Altaie>but are we pulling it from GDH or is it
no so all the WIP data for the C comes</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/68-3
00:13:17.053 --> 00:13:20.727
<v Marwan Altaie>directly from three, right?
So we can take that away to say you could</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/68-4
00:13:20.727 --> 00:13:23.980
<v Marwan Altaie>have a three ES on an upgrade path, yeah,
it's going up to 3.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/68-5
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.817
<v Marwan Altaie>1 and then potentially to a future.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/69-0
00:13:25.937 --> 00:13:29.584
<v Marwan Altaie>One that'll have an API library.
I think at that point we may have some</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/69-1
00:13:29.584 --> 00:13:33.788
<v Marwan Altaie>conversations about how it can integrate,
but it's worth us just confirming how is</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/69-2
00:13:33.788 --> 00:13:36.776
<v Marwan Altaie>there any WIP capability coming in the
new version of the,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/69-3
00:13:36.776 --> 00:13:40.220
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't know if something I have asked
the question multiple times.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/69-4
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.297
<v Marwan Altaie>If you get an answer, please let me know.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/70-0
00:13:43.377 --> 00:13:47.737
<v Marwan Altaie>OK. And that's so you might not be happy,
no, I can only ask.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/71-0
00:13:50.377 --> 00:13:53.396
<v Marwan Altaie>It feels like a bit of a phase two thing
then anyway, doesn't it?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/71-1
00:13:53.396 --> 00:13:56.827
<v Marwan Altaie>If it needs to rely so heavily on the 3E
integrations and stuff like that,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/71-2
00:13:56.827 --> 00:14:00.532
<v Marwan Altaie>but hopefully let's see what you know,
let's see what the what's what we've got.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/71-3
00:14:00.532 --> 00:14:02.819
<v Marwan Altaie>And yeah,
I think what I was really trying to say</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/71-4
00:14:02.819 --> 00:14:05.518
<v Marwan Altaie>is if it's not going to be in the future
version of three,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/71-5
00:14:05.518 --> 00:14:09.085
<v Marwan Altaie>then we need to make sure that whatever
data source is getting pulled from is</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/71-6
00:14:09.085 --> 00:14:09.497
<v Marwan Altaie>actually.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/72-0
00:14:09.657 --> 00:14:12.017
<v Marwan Altaie>A decent data source because we have a
lot of.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/73-0
00:14:13.377 --> 00:14:15.500
<v Marwan Altaie>Ones that we have a lot of data sources,
however,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/73-1
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.537
<v Marwan Altaie>they'll show you that you can trust
implicitly.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/74-0
00:14:19.857 --> 00:14:23.337
<v Marwan Altaie>It's probably always going to the EBN 3
right though that is your source of truth.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/75-0
00:14:30.577 --> 00:14:33.518
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. So the the,
the source of truth of whip is 3 E</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/75-1
00:14:33.518 --> 00:14:38.012
<v Marwan Altaie>absolutely because the the all their time
gets loaded into intact that time from</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/75-2
00:14:38.012 --> 00:14:42.617
<v Marwan Altaie>intact gets loaded directly into 3 E so
it is absolutely the source of everything.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/76-0
00:14:45.617 --> 00:14:48.244
<v Marwan Altaie>So a high level,
that's what I've elicited from the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/76-1
00:14:48.244 --> 00:14:50.872
<v Marwan Altaie>process maps,
but it sounds like it's relatively in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/76-2
00:14:50.872 --> 00:14:54.510
<v Marwan Altaie>line with what you've discussed.
Three is where you're pulling the data</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/76-3
00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.935
<v Marwan Altaie>from.
You have your month to date billing where</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/76-4
00:14:56.935 --> 00:14:59.057
<v Marwan Altaie>any of your deltas and changes are raised.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/77-0
00:14:59.537 --> 00:15:03.361
<v Marwan Altaie>And then your updates.
I'm assuming those are purely e-mail</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/77-1
00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:07.249
<v Marwan Altaie>teams back and forths, no,
really auditable, which is ideal,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/77-2
00:15:07.249 --> 00:15:10.499
<v Marwan Altaie>but it's fine.
We can work on that non responders.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/77-3
00:15:10.499 --> 00:15:14.897
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm assuming again that's just constant
chasing. There's no kind of.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/78-0
00:15:15.377 --> 00:15:18.376
<v Marwan Altaie>Proper process in place where you have
sort of escalations and approvals,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/78-1
00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:21.658
<v Marwan Altaie>there is a disclosure is we've just we've
literally just bought it in this month</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/78-2
00:15:21.658 --> 00:15:24.453
<v Marwan Altaie>for the first proper time.
So This is why it's not being documented.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/78-3
00:15:24.453 --> 00:15:27.128
<v Marwan Altaie>So I can talk you through that's very,
very basic, but yeah yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/78-4
00:15:27.128 --> 00:15:28.951
<v Marwan Altaie>the escalations and approvals would be
good.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/78-5
00:15:28.951 --> 00:15:32.193
<v Marwan Altaie>So even if you send it across afterwards
just for visibility because we can set</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/78-6
00:15:32.193 --> 00:15:34.097
<v Marwan Altaie>those workflows up potentially in service
now.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/79-0
00:15:35.217 --> 00:15:38.534
<v Marwan Altaie>Then you yeah. Reversals.
And then it goes to E billing.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/79-1
00:15:38.534 --> 00:15:43.131
<v Marwan Altaie>But that sounds like it's in line with
main delays that I've identified. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/79-2
00:15:43.131 --> 00:15:47.496
<v Marwan Altaie>hunting for the right contact e-mail
thread having to go back and evidence</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/79-3
00:15:47.496 --> 00:15:51.919
<v Marwan Altaie>what you've approved evidenced what
you've decided tracking late status and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/79-4
00:15:51.919 --> 00:15:52.617
<v Marwan Altaie>chasers and.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/80-0
00:15:54.097 --> 00:15:58.023
<v Marwan Altaie>Evidencing what you've decided that's in
line with no integrations. Again, it's.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/80-1
00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:00.737
<v Marwan Altaie>It's what I'm trying to resolve at this
moment in time.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/81-0
00:16:02.177 --> 00:16:06.165
<v Marwan Altaie>Just a quick one, Chris.
Throughout the whole of the finance,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/81-1
00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:11.439
<v Marwan Altaie>the weeks we've had audit was a big thing
is audit a big thing on whip as well or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/81-2
00:16:11.439 --> 00:16:16.584
<v Marwan Altaie>is it sort of excluded when it comes to
being audited it's it's covered loosely</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/81-3
00:16:16.584 --> 00:16:16.777
<v Marwan Altaie>so.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/82-0
00:16:18.457 --> 00:16:22.734
<v Marwan Altaie>It's covered more in the fact that we are
asked by auditors to value our whip,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/82-1
00:16:22.734 --> 00:16:27.173
<v Marwan Altaie>so it's probably not the level of detail
for transactions that you would get with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/82-2
00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:31.450
<v Marwan Altaie>other finance things like cashiers or AP
where they don't really care too much</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/82-3
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.428
<v Marwan Altaie>about that.
It's more about the valuation of the whip.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/82-4
00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:37.297
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it other?
Is all this value of whip that you are.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/83-0
00:16:37.337 --> 00:16:40.705
<v Marwan Altaie>Are holding actually true? It does. It.
Does it correlate to what's on the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/83-1
00:16:40.705 --> 00:16:43.085
<v Marwan Altaie>balance sheet?
They're probably more concerned about</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/83-2
00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:44.927
<v Marwan Altaie>that,
although there is a question about</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/83-3
00:16:44.927 --> 00:16:47.576
<v Marwan Altaie>reversed, you know,
billing and then reversing billing and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/83-4
00:16:47.576 --> 00:16:49.732
<v Marwan Altaie>reversing. I suppose that does come up.
OK, OK,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/83-5
00:16:49.732 --> 00:16:53.280
<v Marwan Altaie>so it's all extracted from 3:00 AM on
your significant report anyway. So yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/83-6
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.840
<v Marwan Altaie>exactly. Right.
And I guess they don't really care if we</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/83-7
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.097
<v Marwan Altaie>change the partner partners.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/84-0
00:16:57.137 --> 00:16:59.967
<v Marwan Altaie>If you're going to bill it or not,
what they care about is the actual value</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/84-1
00:16:59.967 --> 00:17:01.457
<v Marwan Altaie>of the whip, and if it's, if it's right.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/85-0
00:17:03.417 --> 00:17:06.045
<v Marwan Altaie>You're saying for the most part,
audit can be done in three,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/85-1
00:17:06.045 --> 00:17:09.620
<v Marwan Altaie>because it's just the valuations and the
numbers as long as they balance out well,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/85-2
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.602
<v Marwan Altaie>the valuations aren't actually held in
three,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/85-3
00:17:11.602 --> 00:17:14.617
<v Marwan Altaie>they're actually held in Excel and
they're also held by the financial</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/85-4
00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:18.063
<v Marwan Altaie>accountants elsewhere around the world,
depending what you do here. But anyway,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/85-5
00:17:18.063 --> 00:17:20.303
<v Marwan Altaie>this is,
I guess this is because we are a new team.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/85-6
00:17:20.303 --> 00:17:21.337
<v Marwan Altaie>We're kind of gradually.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/86-0
00:17:21.977 --> 00:17:25.754
<v Marwan Altaie>So there's currently processes done
around the world to value whip by the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/86-1
00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:29.122
<v Marwan Altaie>various finance managers,
but as a whip team we are slowly taking</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/86-2
00:17:29.122 --> 00:17:33.052
<v Marwan Altaie>that away for the finance managers to
bring it to a central point so that we</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/86-3
00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.501
<v Marwan Altaie>can be the controller of the value of the
whip.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/86-4
00:17:35.501 --> 00:17:39.737
<v Marwan Altaie>So we can do it for the whole firm rather
than people having Excel spreadsheets in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/86-5
00:17:39.737 --> 00:17:41.217
<v Marwan Altaie>Hamburg and Paris and Madrid.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/87-0
00:17:42.977 --> 00:17:43.697
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/88-0
00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:46.857
<v Marwan Altaie>The consistent process is wrong.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/89-0
00:17:51.057 --> 00:17:51.937
<v Marwan Altaie>It is now, yes.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/90-0
00:17:55.137 --> 00:17:57.765
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool.
So I thought it would be worth having a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/90-1
00:17:57.765 --> 00:18:01.764
<v Marwan Altaie>little activity just at a high level
defining who can access what and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/90-2
00:18:01.764 --> 00:18:06.276
<v Marwan Altaie>potentially using this to create the role
based access controls and assignment</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/90-3
00:18:06.276 --> 00:18:09.761
<v Marwan Altaie>groups within WIPP. Ultimately,
you don't have many systems,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/90-4
00:18:09.761 --> 00:18:13.017
<v Marwan Altaie>but I thought at a high level was worth
just discussing.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/91-0
00:18:13.697 --> 00:18:18.197
<v Marwan Altaie>Even if it's not done today,
an ideal world who should have access and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/91-1
00:18:18.197 --> 00:18:22.760
<v Marwan Altaie>disability, so 3E as a system?
Do we have kind of assignment groups and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/91-2
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.703
<v Marwan Altaie>approval groups that we can lift and
shift or is that still being defined for</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/91-3
00:18:27.703 --> 00:18:29.097
<v Marwan Altaie>the WIC teams we have?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/92-0
00:18:29.697 --> 00:18:33.711
<v Marwan Altaie>Roles in three E you're based on your
role.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/92-1
00:18:33.711 --> 00:18:41.008
<v Marwan Altaie>You will have a certain level of access
within 3 E there are no approval levels</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/92-2
00:18:41.008 --> 00:18:44.657
<v Marwan Altaie>on WIP and debt built into three at all.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/93-0
00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:48.471
<v Marwan Altaie>Because three is in effect,
you're recording information in three</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/93-1
00:18:48.471 --> 00:18:51.941
<v Marwan Altaie>you're not necessarily sending out emails
from three, if that makes sense,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/93-2
00:18:51.941 --> 00:18:55.087
<v Marwan Altaie>like I'm not. If I'm cursed you.
I'm not sending out an e-mail to a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/93-3
00:18:55.087 --> 00:18:57.539
<v Marwan Altaie>partner and saying,
are you going to bill it or not?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/93-4
00:18:57.539 --> 00:19:00.546
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm sending it from my outlook,
but I will pull the information.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/93-5
00:19:00.546 --> 00:19:03.137
<v Marwan Altaie>You could pull the information from three,
for example.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/94-0
00:19:03.417 --> 00:19:05.877
<v Marwan Altaie>It's purely your system of record.
That's that's it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/94-1
00:19:05.877 --> 00:19:09.452
<v Marwan Altaie>It's just it's just operations. Yeah,
yeah, you're actioning. It is outside.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/94-2
00:19:09.452 --> 00:19:13.304
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. Yeah. Is it worth having? And I'm.
I'm thinking because you can then ship it</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/94-3
00:19:13.304 --> 00:19:16.229
<v Marwan Altaie>across the service. Now,
even if you don't have approvals in a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/94-4
00:19:16.229 --> 00:19:18.874
<v Marwan Altaie>kind of standard sense,
if you have sort of review time.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/94-5
00:19:18.874 --> 00:19:19.617
<v Marwan Altaie>Checkpoints. So.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/95-0
00:19:20.137 --> 00:19:23.240
<v Marwan Altaie>Is the whip at the state?
It needs to be in three months down the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/95-1
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.578
<v Marwan Altaie>line and you have certain approval
approvals within there that kind of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/95-2
00:19:26.578 --> 00:19:29.822
<v Marwan Altaie>consolidate that information.
So you say you have loads of different</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/95-3
00:19:29.822 --> 00:19:33.207
<v Marwan Altaie>Excel spreadsheets around the world.
Is it worth kind of having certain</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/95-4
00:19:33.207 --> 00:19:35.417
<v Marwan Altaie>Members consolidate that and then
validate it?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/96-0
00:19:35.977 --> 00:19:39.088
<v Marwan Altaie>So you know you're on track,
so the consolidation is what we're doing</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/96-1
00:19:39.088 --> 00:19:41.622
<v Marwan Altaie>at the moment.
So this is part of this bro bringing into</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/96-2
00:19:41.622 --> 00:19:44.288
<v Marwan Altaie>a global process.
So This is why we've got this one process</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/96-3
00:19:44.288 --> 00:19:47.399
<v Marwan Altaie>now because people were doing it.
So it's all kind of moving into one</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/96-4
00:19:47.399 --> 00:19:48.377
<v Marwan Altaie>document as it is now.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/97-0
00:19:52.137 --> 00:19:56.073
<v Marwan Altaie>And my risk with one document as well,
it's it's it's a really easy thing to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/97-1
00:19:56.073 --> 00:19:59.957
<v Marwan Altaie>happen, I click the wrong field,
I've changed the wrong fields. Absolutely.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/97-2
00:19:59.957 --> 00:20:03.433
<v Marwan Altaie>This is what we're in Excel. I mean,
you can go in and delete data.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/97-3
00:20:03.433 --> 00:20:05.017
<v Marwan Altaie>It's very sadly it does happen.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/98-0
00:20:06.417 --> 00:20:10.100
<v Marwan Altaie>Could you turn it on? I mean,
a lot of that will be in our new WIP</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/98-1
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.508
<v Marwan Altaie>report as well because we'll be valuing
the WIPP within that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/98-2
00:20:13.508 --> 00:20:16.696
<v Marwan Altaie>So then I suppose it takes away that
exercise, but again,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/98-3
00:20:16.696 --> 00:20:20.654
<v Marwan Altaie>it's one spreadsheet as opposed to many,
which is an improvement. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/98-4
00:20:20.654 --> 00:20:23.677
<v Marwan Altaie>it's a starting point.
You've you've merged one right,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/98-5
00:20:23.677 --> 00:20:24.337
<v Marwan Altaie>also global.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/99-0
00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:28.367
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. Look,
we're trying to three hasn't delivered</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/99-1
00:20:28.367 --> 00:20:31.547
<v Marwan Altaie>what we need.
So we have tried to find a interim</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/99-2
00:20:31.547 --> 00:20:35.765
<v Marwan Altaie>solution and the interim solution is a
global Excel spreadsheet.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/99-3
00:20:35.765 --> 00:20:40.438
<v Marwan Altaie>It's absolutely fallible. I mean,
it's as good as an Excel spreadsheet.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/99-4
00:20:40.438 --> 00:20:44.137
<v Marwan Altaie>It's as good as the 50 odd users that
have access to it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/101-0
00:20:44.177 --> 00:20:48.643
<v Marwan Altaie>And then go into it and do what they want
in it. But we are we have what we have.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/101-1
00:20:48.643 --> 00:20:51.366
<v Marwan Altaie>You can control access to the spreadsheet
though,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/101-2
00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:53.925
<v Marwan Altaie>and I assume you do to a certain extent
we do,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/101-3
00:20:53.925 --> 00:20:57.301
<v Marwan Altaie>but there's still 50 people that need
access to that, OK. OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/101-4
00:20:57.301 --> 00:21:01.604
<v Marwan Altaie>And if you think all the local offices,
business managers and finance managers</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/101-5
00:21:01.604 --> 00:21:02.257
<v Marwan Altaie>need access.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/102-0
00:21:02.697 --> 00:21:07.452
<v Marwan Altaie>And whilst you can ask them not to do
certain things. Yeah, yeah, you are. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/102-1
00:21:07.452 --> 00:21:11.503
<v Marwan Altaie>It's just human error as well.
Anything for the information out of a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/102-2
00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:14.966
<v Marwan Altaie>cell. Yeah. Look,
one one of the team accidentally deleted</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/102-3
00:21:14.966 --> 00:21:19.897
<v Marwan Altaie>the spreadsheet so that it it it you know
it it can happen. But you know it's just.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/103-0
00:21:20.337 --> 00:21:23.657
<v Marwan Altaie>It's human error which didn't want to,
but just know well all those games.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/104-0
00:21:28.257 --> 00:21:32.767
<v Marwan Altaie>So we do have roles we can lift and shift
fine. I'll update this afterwards.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/104-1
00:21:32.767 --> 00:21:36.281
<v Marwan Altaie>I won't do it in a meeting,
but that's that's good to know.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/104-2
00:21:36.281 --> 00:21:39.736
<v Marwan Altaie>The human error and deleting stuff is
slightly concerning,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/104-3
00:21:39.736 --> 00:21:43.777
<v Marwan Altaie>but I'm sure you're managing it. Yeah,
cool. Any region based roles.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/105-0
00:21:44.417 --> 00:21:48.192
<v Marwan Altaie>Or I'm assuming because you standardise
now you've kind of standardised the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/105-1
00:21:48.192 --> 00:21:51.471
<v Marwan Altaie>processes and the rules. Yeah,
and there's no policy, regulatory,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/105-2
00:21:51.471 --> 00:21:55.097
<v Marwan Altaie>legal things we need to consider with the
whip? No, none at all. OK, no.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/106-0
00:21:57.177 --> 00:21:57.577
<v Marwan Altaie>That's good.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/107-0
00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:01.217
<v Marwan Altaie>I know we get.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/108-0
00:22:00.817 --> 00:22:03.346
<v Parik Narain>Chris,
can I request is it possible for us to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/108-1
00:22:03.346 --> 00:22:07.688
<v Parik Narain>see the Excel at some point either today
or tomorrow, a template or something?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/108-2
00:22:07.688 --> 00:22:09.777
<v Parik Narain>Just so we see what you capture there.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/109-0
00:22:10.617 --> 00:22:13.497
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry, say the first bit again, Mr.
You want to get sick?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/112-0
00:22:12.777 --> 00:22:15.913
<v Parik Narain>And you can you share the Excel sheet
with us so that we can see what you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/112-1
00:22:15.913 --> 00:22:17.057
<v Parik Narain>capture in the Excel sheet.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/111-0
00:22:16.017 --> 00:22:16.337
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/113-0
00:22:17.697 --> 00:22:19.537
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, no worries. Yeah. Yeah.
Just make a note.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/114-0
00:22:19.577 --> 00:22:20.737
<v Parik Narain>At some point here. Thanks.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/115-0
00:22:21.257 --> 00:22:21.497
<v Marwan Altaie>Go.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/116-0
00:22:25.817 --> 00:22:28.551
<v Marwan Altaie>I guess we've we've spoken about the
Excel and Whip spreadsheet,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/116-1
00:22:28.551 --> 00:22:31.075
<v Marwan Altaie>so that's accessible to pretty much
everyone at this point.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/116-2
00:22:31.075 --> 00:22:33.725
<v Marwan Altaie>If you have the link,
I'm assuming there's no real controls in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/116-3
00:22:33.725 --> 00:22:33.977
<v Marwan Altaie>place.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/117-0
00:22:35.337 --> 00:22:37.377
<v Marwan Altaie>OK,
so these are process outside the service.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/117-1
00:22:37.377 --> 00:22:39.906
<v Marwan Altaie>Now it's just understanding what you have
at the moment.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/117-2
00:22:39.906 --> 00:22:43.188
<v Marwan Altaie>If there's stuff we can lift and shift if
there's not, it's not an issue,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/117-3
00:22:43.188 --> 00:22:46.293
<v Marwan Altaie>but it sounds as a new team,
you're still defining and trying to work</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/117-4
00:22:46.293 --> 00:22:48.732
<v Marwan Altaie>around it which which is perfectly fine
at this stage.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/117-5
00:22:48.732 --> 00:22:52.325
<v Marwan Altaie>And then teams shared drive, same process,
you just have whoever needs to be and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/117-6
00:22:52.325 --> 00:22:52.857
<v Marwan Altaie>those teams.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/118-0
00:22:54.017 --> 00:22:57.803
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, so the document is,
the Excel spreadsheet is actually saved</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/118-1
00:22:57.803 --> 00:23:02.162
<v Marwan Altaie>in teams and the the access to the
document is controlled by who has access</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/118-2
00:23:02.162 --> 00:23:05.603
<v Marwan Altaie>to that team's channel.
There are probably about 50 people,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/118-3
00:23:05.603 --> 00:23:07.897
<v Marwan Altaie>potentially a bit more that have access.</v>

00:23:08.897 --> 00:23:12.872
<v Marwan Altaie>Is there any personal information or
confidential information on these whip</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/119-1
00:23:12.872 --> 00:23:17.160
<v Marwan Altaie>reports that shouldn't be visible to all
of those people or being added in all of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/119-2
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.978
<v Marwan Altaie>those people have been added in,
have the right to see that information,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/119-3
00:23:20.978 --> 00:23:25.057
<v Marwan Altaie>but there is confidential information in
that because there are matter names.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/120-0
00:23:25.577 --> 00:23:26.817
<v Marwan Altaie>Which may contain.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/121-0
00:23:29.497 --> 00:23:31.803
<v Marwan Altaie>Confidential information.
Potentially I mean,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/121-1
00:23:31.803 --> 00:23:35.814
<v Marwan Altaie>but if they're true black book stuff,
so stuff that no one can know about apart</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/121-2
00:23:35.814 --> 00:23:39.675
<v Marwan Altaie>from an elite few, they'll be exed out.
There'll be a, you know, they'll be.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/121-3
00:23:39.675 --> 00:23:43.084
<v Marwan Altaie>You'll just get a matter name that says
confidential, confidential,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/121-4
00:23:43.084 --> 00:23:46.845
<v Marwan Altaie>something like that. But there are.
That's your probably what I call black</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/121-5
00:23:46.845 --> 00:23:47.697
<v Marwan Altaie>book stuff stuff.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/122-0
00:23:47.857 --> 00:23:51.595
<v Marwan Altaie>But you know, like we don't need to know.
But then there's another letter of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/122-1
00:23:51.595 --> 00:23:54.265
<v Marwan Altaie>confidentiality,
which is just kind of what stuff like</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/122-2
00:23:54.265 --> 00:23:57.809
<v Marwan Altaie>employment, for example. You know,
the matter might be called, you know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/122-3
00:23:57.809 --> 00:24:01.304
<v Marwan Altaie>Kirsty Rennie's termination or something
or, you know, and that's nice.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/122-4
00:24:01.304 --> 00:24:03.537
<v Marwan Altaie>They're flagged as confidential just
because.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/123-0
00:24:03.857 --> 00:24:07.793
<v Marwan Altaie>Just to make sure that information
doesn't go out to the client,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/123-1
00:24:07.793 --> 00:24:11.427
<v Marwan Altaie>it's unlike to but,
but all those people who have access to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/123-2
00:24:11.427 --> 00:24:15.302
<v Marwan Altaie>that team's channel have the right to see
the matter names. OK,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/123-3
00:24:15.302 --> 00:24:20.208
<v Marwan Altaie>so on a confidential, confidential level,
it's managed individually and then the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/123-4
00:24:20.208 --> 00:24:23.417
<v Marwan Altaie>rest of it is low risk. Confidential.
Exactly right.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/124-0
00:24:23.657 --> 00:24:25.716
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, yeah.
And if you're in finance generally,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/124-1
00:24:25.716 --> 00:24:29.061
<v Marwan Altaie>your access is pretty good across the
confidential stuff like they're pretty,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/124-2
00:24:29.061 --> 00:24:31.120
<v Marwan Altaie>yeah,
the assumption is that we're not going to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/124-3
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.650
<v Marwan Altaie>start sharing stuff,
but the confidential stuff's flagged.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/124-4
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.966
<v Marwan Altaie>It's probably more relevant.
The credit control side,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/124-5
00:24:35.966 --> 00:24:38.368
<v Marwan Altaie>because we don't want someone setting out,
for example,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/124-6
00:24:38.368 --> 00:24:41.070
<v Marwan Altaie>a copy invoice to an accounts payable
team that has, you know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/124-7
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.257
<v Marwan Altaie>an employment matter on it or something
like that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/125-0
00:24:43.537 --> 00:24:45.819
<v Marwan Altaie>For obvious reasons. No,
that's that's fine. I was.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/125-1
00:24:45.819 --> 00:24:49.154
<v Marwan Altaie>I was just wondering because it seems
like you have a lot of data in there,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/125-2
00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:52.270
<v Marwan Altaie>so just but it's being managed
individually which is which is like and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/125-3
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.122
<v Marwan Altaie>then emails teams chats.
I'm assuming whoever needs to be in the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/125-4
00:24:55.122 --> 00:24:58.457
<v Marwan Altaie>loop just gets CCD then and then that's
how it's managed for the most part.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/126-0
00:24:58.977 --> 00:25:02.917
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, cool. Chris,
just to get an idea of how big that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/126-1
00:25:02.917 --> 00:25:08.419
<v Marwan Altaie>report is, is it thousands of rows?
Is it hundreds of rows? Does it vary?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/126-2
00:25:08.419 --> 00:25:13.697
<v Marwan Altaie>It's as Jenny rows as we have matters
that have outstanding width. So.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/127-0
00:25:15.577 --> 00:25:18.439
<v Marwan Altaie>To know what it is at the moment,
what have we got?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/127-1
00:25:18.439 --> 00:25:21.576
<v Marwan Altaie>Have you got a copy of it?
Could we pop it up on screen?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/127-2
00:25:21.576 --> 00:25:24.988
<v Marwan Altaie>It's reduction 552. No, it's not.
That's not right. Normally,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/127-3
00:25:24.988 --> 00:25:27.795
<v Marwan Altaie>that's not too bad.
I could bring up screen. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/127-4
00:25:27.795 --> 00:25:31.097
<v Marwan Altaie>if you want me to. Yeah.
Has it got client sensitive stuff?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/128-0
00:25:33.217 --> 00:25:42.401
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, 11,000 how much? Sorry? 11,
011 thousand rows of data and that's wide</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/128-1
00:25:42.401 --> 00:25:50.841
<v Marwan Altaie>wide a. No, it's 80 8080.
It goes to a column. So how many is that?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/128-2
00:25:50.841 --> 00:25:51.337
<v Marwan Altaie>1/8.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/129-0
00:25:53.897 --> 00:26:00.640
<v Marwan Altaie>46 call them AT spell AT. Yeah.
Sorry I have the same as you.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/129-1
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.337
<v Marwan Altaie>I thought 80. Yeah. Yeah, it's 46.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/130-0
00:26:06.937 --> 00:26:10.299
<v Marwan Altaie>And that obviously fluctuates with
depending how many matters we have open</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/130-1
00:26:10.299 --> 00:26:12.496
<v Marwan Altaie>with open width.
So the number goes up and down.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/130-2
00:26:12.496 --> 00:26:15.858
<v Marwan Altaie>So you'll find it generally goes down a
lot at the start of the next month</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/130-3
00:26:15.858 --> 00:26:18.951
<v Marwan Altaie>because we raise all well,
we raise a lot of bills at the end of the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/130-4
00:26:18.951 --> 00:26:21.103
<v Marwan Altaie>month.
So consequently lots of those which gets</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/130-5
00:26:21.103 --> 00:26:24.017
<v Marwan Altaie>built and then it gradually builds up
throughout the next month.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/131-0
00:26:24.977 --> 00:26:27.909
<v Marwan Altaie>What was that cycle?
So which was the maximum?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/131-1
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:32.649
<v Marwan Altaie>I would say that's probably close.
I mean it's there or thereabouts between</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/131-2
00:26:32.649 --> 00:26:37.701
<v Marwan Altaie>9012 thousand depending that the that can
go out very quickly though because you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/131-3
00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:41.817
<v Marwan Altaie>may have a time of year for example,
we have a lot of IP matters.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/132-0
00:26:42.417 --> 00:26:45.541
<v Marwan Altaie>And they're very small value,
but they run on a a kind of schedule.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/132-1
00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:48.987
<v Marwan Altaie>So the IPS get renewed every so often.
And when they get renewed suddenly,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/132-2
00:26:48.987 --> 00:26:51.422
<v Marwan Altaie>you'll see the great influx of matters
that come in.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/132-3
00:26:51.422 --> 00:26:55.052
<v Marwan Altaie>And there's other other nuances around
the world where you might get corporate</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/132-4
00:26:55.052 --> 00:26:57.257
<v Marwan Altaie>deals and suddenly you get a lot more and
yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/133-0
00:26:58.617 --> 00:27:02.571
<v Marwan Altaie>It's going to check in terms of the value
because there is a lot of rows in there.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/133-1
00:27:02.571 --> 00:27:04.715
<v Marwan Altaie>Is there a certain value to go OK about?
No,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/133-2
00:27:04.715 --> 00:27:08.002
<v Marwan Altaie>these ones are the ones because I know
you call it significant whip.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/133-3
00:27:08.002 --> 00:27:11.860
<v Marwan Altaie>So is there a certain threshold levels
that you set that that's the one that the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/133-4
00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.337
<v Marwan Altaie>team goes after or is it? Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/134-0
00:27:14.137 --> 00:27:15.577
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes, so there's a.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/135-0
00:27:18.017 --> 00:27:20.935
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean,
it's a slightly different for October,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/135-1
00:27:20.935 --> 00:27:25.964
<v Marwan Altaie>but it's normally the top 135 Mars plus
the top 15 aged Mars and that's how much</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/135-2
00:27:25.964 --> 00:27:29.378
<v Marwan Altaie>the team can manage resource wise at the
minute. Well,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/135-3
00:27:29.378 --> 00:27:33.600
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll be taking a slightly different
approach going forward though,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/135-4
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.897
<v Marwan Altaie>and we're going to have a more, more.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/136-0
00:27:36.337 --> 00:27:39.525
<v Marwan Altaie>Fluid approach and the team will try and
cover everything that has any kind of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/136-1
00:27:39.525 --> 00:27:40.977
<v Marwan Altaie>value on it, probably over like 10K.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/137-0
00:27:43.657 --> 00:27:47.101
<v Marwan Altaie>We need to manage our resources,
so we'll try to pick your battles and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/137-1
00:27:47.101 --> 00:27:50.739
<v Marwan Altaie>that's where you maybe go after the
biggest value batters or the ones with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/137-2
00:27:50.739 --> 00:27:54.329
<v Marwan Altaie>the utmost aged whip, for example,
the troublesome partners that you know</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/137-3
00:27:54.329 --> 00:27:57.531
<v Marwan Altaie>are the ones that probably need a bit of
a prompt to build. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/137-4
00:27:57.531 --> 00:27:59.762
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm just thinking from a certain
perspective,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/137-5
00:27:59.762 --> 00:28:03.497
<v Marwan Altaie>you start to create these sort of
requests of cases that you can then start.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/138-0
00:28:03.697 --> 00:28:06.669
<v Marwan Altaie>To look at capacity,
how much the team is going through the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/138-1
00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:09.244
<v Marwan Altaie>throughput,
which kind of helps you to kind of give</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/138-2
00:28:09.244 --> 00:28:12.860
<v Marwan Altaie>that view back in terms of this is how
much we're trying to get through.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/138-3
00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.782
<v Marwan Altaie>But there's still all of this stuff
that's still leftover.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/138-4
00:28:15.782 --> 00:28:18.209
<v Marwan Altaie>So that's good to know. OK,
do we have in place?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/138-5
00:28:18.209 --> 00:28:20.537
<v Marwan Altaie>It might not be because it's relatively
new A.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/139-0
00:28:20.937 --> 00:28:25.403
<v Marwan Altaie>If under X amount and over 90 days it's
it's a write off because it's not worth</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/139-1
00:28:25.403 --> 00:28:29.310
<v Marwan Altaie>the amount of time chasing it.
Or are we aiming to chase every bit of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/139-2
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.213
<v Marwan Altaie>funds or whip items?
There's not really a set rule.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/139-3
00:28:32.213 --> 00:28:36.846
<v Marwan Altaie>The difficult we have is it is that every
practise will have their version of what</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/139-4
00:28:36.846 --> 00:28:40.697
<v Marwan Altaie>they consider to be a significant amount.
So if you go to corporate.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/140-0
00:28:40.737 --> 00:28:43.452
<v Marwan Altaie>Transactions for you're looking at
millions,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/140-1
00:28:43.452 --> 00:28:47.795
<v Marwan Altaie>you know they have they carry a huge
amount of our whip as a firm and a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/140-2
00:28:47.795 --> 00:28:50.992
<v Marwan Altaie>significant amount to them is probably in
the 1,000,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/140-3
00:28:50.992 --> 00:28:55.335
<v Marwan Altaie>000 where a significant amount to our IP
practise may be low thousands.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/140-4
00:28:55.335 --> 00:28:59.497
<v Marwan Altaie>So it kind of vary it kind of difference
between practise group. OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/141-0
00:29:00.217 --> 00:29:03.896
<v Marwan Altaie>That makes sense and in regards to just
thinking about ServiceNow,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/141-1
00:29:03.896 --> 00:29:07.684
<v Marwan Altaie>we do move to that solution.
What kind of data retention or how long</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/141-2
00:29:07.684 --> 00:29:10.869
<v Marwan Altaie>do we want to hold with items or evidence
it or audit it?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/141-3
00:29:10.869 --> 00:29:14.657
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we have any idea of that kind of stuff
from an audit perspective?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/142-0
00:29:15.297 --> 00:29:15.417
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/143-0
00:29:15.817 --> 00:29:18.137
<v Marwan Altaie>No,
we doubt that we does not a set time</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/143-1
00:29:18.137 --> 00:29:21.193
<v Marwan Altaie>because as I said,
it's more about the valuation that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/143-2
00:29:21.193 --> 00:29:25.098
<v Marwan Altaie>valuation is taken at a point in time and
entered into the accounts.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/143-3
00:29:25.098 --> 00:29:27.701
<v Marwan Altaie>So the this is where our accountants step
in.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/143-4
00:29:27.701 --> 00:29:32.228
<v Marwan Altaie>They will take a level of the GL will say
we'll have £250 million worth of whip</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/143-5
00:29:32.228 --> 00:29:35.737
<v Marwan Altaie>globally and they will enter the true
valuation into GL as B.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/144-0
00:29:36.337 --> 00:29:39.512
<v Marwan Altaie>You know, 150 million whatever it is.
So that is your in effect.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/144-1
00:29:39.512 --> 00:29:43.420
<v Marwan Altaie>Your audit for evaluation from a finance
perspective in terms of actually audit</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/144-2
00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:47.181
<v Marwan Altaie>for transactions, no, they won't ask,
there's no limitations of how long you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/144-3
00:29:47.181 --> 00:29:50.503
<v Marwan Altaie>need to keep that data for.
So we could get rid of it straight away</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/144-4
00:29:50.503 --> 00:29:52.017
<v Marwan Altaie>and I don't think anyone would.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/145-0
00:29:52.857 --> 00:29:57.440
<v Marwan Altaie>No, I think from a business point of view,
I think it's probably useful to know and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/145-1
00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.222
<v Marwan Altaie>keep it in there for,
I would say probably a year,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/145-2
00:30:00.222 --> 00:30:04.478
<v Marwan Altaie>I think it's that's that's prudent.
Just to track things because you may have</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/145-3
00:30:04.478 --> 00:30:08.297
<v Marwan Altaie>a matter for I think you may have a
matter that's billed for example.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/146-0
00:30:09.017 --> 00:30:13.589
<v Marwan Altaie>And then nothing happens for a few months
and it's billed again. Is that reasonable,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/146-1
00:30:13.589 --> 00:30:16.170
<v Marwan Altaie>do you think? Yeah. Or, I mean there's,
I mean,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/146-2
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:19.827
<v Marwan Altaie>we're gathering a lot of new data as well.
It might come, you know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/146-3
00:30:19.827 --> 00:30:23.054
<v Marwan Altaie>next financial year.
We look back on this year and say, oh,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/146-4
00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:25.851
<v Marwan Altaie>look at the amount of bill and
completions we have,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/146-5
00:30:25.851 --> 00:30:28.217
<v Marwan Altaie>the amount of monthly matters that we
have.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/147-0
00:30:28.537 --> 00:30:31.827
<v Marwan Altaie>So I think it'd probably be quite good to
have that much data.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/147-1
00:30:31.827 --> 00:30:35.222
<v Marwan Altaie>Do you think a year would be reasonable?
Yeah, I'd say so. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/147-2
00:30:35.222 --> 00:30:38.147
<v Marwan Altaie>One caveat to that is because ServiceNow
is quite good,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/147-3
00:30:38.147 --> 00:30:42.429
<v Marwan Altaie>especially when you've identified certain
data points in order to be able to have</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/147-4
00:30:42.429 --> 00:30:45.040
<v Marwan Altaie>consistent,
potentially yearly trend or quarterly</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/147-5
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.704
<v Marwan Altaie>trends.
If you want to have that long term vision,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/147-6
00:30:47.704 --> 00:30:48.017
<v Marwan Altaie>it is.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/149-0
00:30:48.137 --> 00:30:51.155
<v Marwan Altaie>Worth keeping that data in the system.
That's just one thing to consider,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/149-1
00:30:51.155 --> 00:30:52.990
<v Marwan Altaie>because if you start removing it every
year,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/149-2
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:56.171
<v Marwan Altaie>you're basically starting from scratch.
You don't have the visibility of, OK,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/149-3
00:30:56.171 --> 00:30:58.006
<v Marwan Altaie>three years ago,
this was the current state.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/149-4
00:30:58.006 --> 00:31:00.820
<v Marwan Altaie>This is our current web states.
How can we identify what's happened?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/149-5
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.778
<v Marwan Altaie>What's changed?
It gives you that good holistic</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/149-6
00:31:02.778 --> 00:31:04.817
<v Marwan Altaie>visibility and kind of that long term
visibility.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/150-0
00:31:05.297 --> 00:31:09.139
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, yeah. Look, keeping it longer,
but it's certainly not be a good thing.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/150-1
00:31:09.139 --> 00:31:13.030
<v Marwan Altaie>I more think it's practicality wise
because we're saving spreadsheets and for</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/150-2
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:16.572
<v Marwan Altaie>our IT team phone me up and say, Chris,
you're saving 50 spreadsheets,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/150-3
00:31:16.572 --> 00:31:19.615
<v Marwan Altaie>everybody teams channel,
they start telling us off the other</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/150-4
00:31:19.615 --> 00:31:22.559
<v Marwan Altaie>memory we're using up.
But you know I we kept the data for</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/150-5
00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:23.257
<v Marwan Altaie>longer, great.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/151-0
00:31:24.017 --> 00:31:28.314
<v Marwan Altaie>It's a good thing. OK, cool.
Any more questions about where whip lives</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/151-1
00:31:28.314 --> 00:31:31.097
<v Marwan Altaie>today? Or we could for this section,
for now.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/152-0
00:31:33.497 --> 00:31:37.505
<v Marwan Altaie>Like silence is a yes. Perfect.
So this is just a list of the current</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/152-1
00:31:37.505 --> 00:31:40.426
<v Marwan Altaie>whip roles.
It might not be aligned to what you've</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/152-2
00:31:40.426 --> 00:31:44.663
<v Marwan Altaie>done if you've standardised it,
but I just wanted to understand at a high</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/152-3
00:31:44.663 --> 00:31:47.297
<v Marwan Altaie>level,
is this how it typically goes through.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/152-4
00:31:47.297 --> 00:31:50.962
<v Marwan Altaie>So you have the whip, analysts,
you have your revenue managers,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/152-5
00:31:50.962 --> 00:31:52.737
<v Marwan Altaie>business managers, PE partners.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/153-0
00:31:53.577 --> 00:31:58.012
<v Marwan Altaie>Whip team so I'm assuming allocate the
work to the whip analyst and then the E</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/153-1
00:31:58.012 --> 00:32:00.257
<v Marwan Altaie>building team to ultimately send it out.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/154-0
00:32:01.697 --> 00:32:07.059
<v Marwan Altaie>So whip analysts are who goes and gets
the information for the parts and peas.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/154-1
00:32:07.059 --> 00:32:10.860
<v Marwan Altaie>They recheck the parts bees,
they do all the hard work,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/154-2
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:15.747
<v Marwan Altaie>the global revenue manager, me,
does less of the hard work and gets the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/154-3
00:32:15.747 --> 00:32:18.937
<v Marwan Altaie>team to do it. Kirsty, team leader,
obviously.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/155-0
00:32:19.377 --> 00:32:23.990
<v Marwan Altaie>Supports the team,
helps them when they need the guidance.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/155-1
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:29.228
<v Marwan Altaie>Business managers are are we have a
business manager per division.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/155-2
00:32:29.228 --> 00:32:33.137
<v Marwan Altaie>Divisions are high level.
So we have 5 divisions.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/156-0
00:32:34.577 --> 00:32:39.582
<v Marwan Altaie>And they'll split up into Australia and
then rest of the world and the business</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/156-1
00:32:39.582 --> 00:32:42.710
<v Marwan Altaie>manager.
Business managers cover those divisions.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/156-2
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:45.588
<v Marwan Altaie>They are there as a kind of escalation
point.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/156-3
00:32:45.588 --> 00:32:50.217
<v Marwan Altaie>They deal business managers deal directly
with a practise and a division.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/157-0
00:32:51.337 --> 00:32:56.054
<v Marwan Altaie>Under their roles and responsibilities,
they are responsible for the PNL for that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/157-1
00:32:56.054 --> 00:33:00.138
<v Marwan Altaie>practise or division and consequently
under that PNL comes building in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/157-2
00:33:00.138 --> 00:33:03.130
<v Marwan Altaie>collections,
so they are there as a kind of port of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/157-3
00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:06.581
<v Marwan Altaie>call to get knowledge off,
but also as an escalation point.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/157-4
00:33:06.581 --> 00:33:08.537
<v Marwan Altaie>So for example if Kirstie's got a.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/158-0
00:33:09.097 --> 00:33:13.271
<v Marwan Altaie>Corporate partner who's not playing ball.
She can go to the business manager.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/158-1
00:33:13.271 --> 00:33:16.588
<v Marwan Altaie>She'd go to practise and say, look,
I'm not getting response.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/158-2
00:33:16.588 --> 00:33:20.815
<v Marwan Altaie>The partners being I can you help and
they will go knocking on doors to go and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/158-3
00:33:20.815 --> 00:33:25.150
<v Marwan Altaie>get that information. OK. He's partners.
That's where we get all our information</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/158-4
00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:25.417
<v Marwan Altaie>from.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/159-0
00:33:26.457 --> 00:33:28.395
<v Marwan Altaie>Ideally,
the team should be reaching out to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/159-1
00:33:28.395 --> 00:33:30.730
<v Marwan Altaie>partners.
The partners should know all that matters,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/159-2
00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.901
<v Marwan Altaie>how much everything's worth when they're
going to build it. In reality,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/159-3
00:33:33.901 --> 00:33:36.412
<v Marwan Altaie>some of the parts,
some of the part the PS probably know</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/159-4
00:33:36.412 --> 00:33:39.187
<v Marwan Altaie>more than the partners,
and you tend to get better information</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/159-5
00:33:39.187 --> 00:33:41.830
<v Marwan Altaie>from some of the PS.
So the team know which ones to go out,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/159-6
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:44.913
<v Marwan Altaie>whether it's partners or PS,
depends on the matters of practise where</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/159-7
00:33:44.913 --> 00:33:45.177
<v Marwan Altaie>it is.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/160-0
00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:49.652
<v Marwan Altaie>Whip team or obviously that's the whip
analysts, basically,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/160-1
00:33:49.652 --> 00:33:54.123
<v Marwan Altaie>that's them as a group and I'll e-mail
and team who you know about because you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/160-2
00:33:54.123 --> 00:33:57.858
<v Marwan Altaie>will have spoke to Lauren and Sandeep and
Co earlier in the week.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/160-3
00:33:57.858 --> 00:34:00.857
<v Marwan Altaie>The only other stakeholders I will factor
into that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/161-0
00:34:02.457 --> 00:34:09.753
<v Marwan Altaie>Our our local finance managers,
so in Europe, US and Middle East,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/161-1
00:34:09.753 --> 00:34:16.497
<v Marwan Altaie>we have regional finance managers who
work in those offices.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/162-0
00:34:17.737 --> 00:34:23.080
<v Marwan Altaie>And the whip teams and the credit control
teams work very closely with those.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/162-1
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:27.737
<v Marwan Altaie>I'll give you an example.
We have a gentleman in Paris called Arno,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/162-2
00:34:27.737 --> 00:34:33.217
<v Marwan Altaie>who is on the ground and when we need
support or help, Arno is there to go and.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/163-0
00:34:33.537 --> 00:34:36.743
<v Marwan Altaie>Do what the business managers do,
maybe in London and Australia.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/163-1
00:34:36.743 --> 00:34:40.195
<v Marwan Altaie>Go knocking on doors. Start.
Start taking that stick to partners when</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/163-2
00:34:40.195 --> 00:34:42.956
<v Marwan Altaie>we need him to.
He's also a very good form of knowledge</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/163-3
00:34:42.956 --> 00:34:46.112
<v Marwan Altaie>because he is on the ground,
he hears things and he shares that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/163-4
00:34:46.112 --> 00:34:47.937
<v Marwan Altaie>knowledge with the teams as well. OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/164-0
00:34:49.217 --> 00:34:50.976
<v Marwan Altaie>They the job title varies throughout the
world,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/164-1
00:34:50.976 --> 00:34:53.577
<v Marwan Altaie>but they're generally we just refer to
them as local finance managers.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/165-0
00:34:55.337 --> 00:35:01.539
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it a case of my first question is why
is OZ and the rest of the world separated</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/165-1
00:35:01.539 --> 00:35:05.275
<v Marwan Altaie>there?
Any specific reason or is it just process?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/165-2
00:35:05.275 --> 00:35:11.253
<v Marwan Altaie>It's a legacy thing the the two firms
merged Australia and the rest of the firm</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/165-3
00:35:11.253 --> 00:35:12.897
<v Marwan Altaie>merged many years ago.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/166-0
00:35:14.017 --> 00:35:16.814
<v Marwan Altaie>And they still,
whilst we are a global law firm,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/166-1
00:35:16.814 --> 00:35:21.323
<v Marwan Altaie>we do tend to operate in a split between
Australia and PNG and the rest of the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/166-2
00:35:21.323 --> 00:35:23.949
<v Marwan Altaie>world.
It's just the way it's always been the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/166-3
00:35:23.949 --> 00:35:27.202
<v Marwan Altaie>division of the business managers work
that way as well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/166-4
00:35:27.202 --> 00:35:29.257
<v Marwan Altaie>I guess it was a helpful time zones.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/167-0
00:35:30.457 --> 00:35:32.689
<v Marwan Altaie>You know,
it's very difficult to have a business</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/167-1
00:35:32.689 --> 00:35:36.423
<v Marwan Altaie>manager supporting a practise if they're
based in Australia and they're trying to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/167-2
00:35:36.423 --> 00:35:39.566
<v Marwan Altaie>support a London practise,
so it tends to be split that way in terms</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/167-3
00:35:39.566 --> 00:35:43.300
<v Marwan Altaie>of our team, it just works in time zones.
That way the whips in Australia pick up</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/167-4
00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.577
<v Marwan Altaie>Australia,
which team up here pick up the rest of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/167-5
00:35:45.577 --> 00:35:49.312
<v Marwan Altaie>the world just because it works with time
zones and being on the same on the same</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/167-6
00:35:49.312 --> 00:35:50.177
<v Marwan Altaie>time with partners.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/168-0
00:35:50.577 --> 00:35:52.639
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.
But the process for the whip is the same</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/168-1
00:35:52.639 --> 00:35:55.572
<v Marwan Altaie>all around. We don't,
but we've try and kept it standardised as</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/168-2
00:35:55.572 --> 00:35:57.542
<v Marwan Altaie>possible.
It's just your business managers</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/168-3
00:35:57.542 --> 00:35:59.833
<v Marwan Altaie>basically because they operate on a
ground level.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/168-4
00:35:59.833 --> 00:36:03.499
<v Marwan Altaie>They need to be slightly different and
know how to operate with those people in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/168-5
00:36:03.499 --> 00:36:06.615
<v Marwan Altaie>those time zones. Exactly right.
That's where the finance managers,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/168-6
00:36:06.615 --> 00:36:10.097
<v Marwan Altaie>business managers come in because a
business manager in UK is great if you.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/169-0
00:36:10.297 --> 00:36:13.158
<v Marwan Altaie>You speak to Auk partner,
but they're probably not going to be good</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/169-1
00:36:13.158 --> 00:36:15.008
<v Marwan Altaie>if you want to speak to a partner in
Dubai,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/169-2
00:36:15.008 --> 00:36:18.037
<v Marwan Altaie>and that's where we speak to our Dubai
Finance manager to go, you know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/169-3
00:36:18.037 --> 00:36:21.529
<v Marwan Altaie>so sometimes you just need someone on the
ground to start door knocking in and get</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/169-4
00:36:21.529 --> 00:36:23.884
<v Marwan Altaie>the engagement.
If you're not getting it from emails or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/169-5
00:36:23.884 --> 00:36:25.777
<v Marwan Altaie>calls or teams meetings,
whatever it may be.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/170-0
00:36:26.577 --> 00:36:29.695
<v Marwan Altaie>Well, that's good to know.
There's not much else on the current whip</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/170-1
00:36:29.695 --> 00:36:31.683
<v Marwan Altaie>rolls.
I think the regional variances makes</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/170-2
00:36:31.683 --> 00:36:33.762
<v Marwan Altaie>sense to me that the business managers,
yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/170-3
00:36:33.762 --> 00:36:37.150
<v Marwan Altaie>they have to operate slightly differently
and the rest of it standardised.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/170-4
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:39.997
<v Marwan Altaie>So for the most part,
that seems the analyst and the whip team</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/170-5
00:36:39.997 --> 00:36:43.522
<v Marwan Altaie>are one of the same here. Yeah. Yeah.
Analysts are just individual with their</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/170-6
00:36:43.522 --> 00:36:46.097
<v Marwan Altaie>amount, which you put together as a team.
Correct? Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/171-0
00:36:46.337 --> 00:36:49.206
<v Marwan Altaie>But that was more in service now for it
to create like a group,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/171-1
00:36:49.206 --> 00:36:52.388
<v Marwan Altaie>we'd have the WIC team and then
allocating to work to the analysts and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/171-2
00:36:52.388 --> 00:36:55.032
<v Marwan Altaie>sounds like they're one of the same
though. So yeah, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/171-3
00:36:55.032 --> 00:36:57.452
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we want to add in credit control as a
stakeholder?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/171-4
00:36:57.452 --> 00:37:01.217
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we want to add in credit control as a
stakeholder? So we've got you built there.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/172-0
00:37:03.377 --> 00:37:03.497
<v Marwan Altaie>None.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/173-0
00:37:05.817 --> 00:37:08.777
<v Marwan Altaie>Mainly like for because these are for the.
These are for the processes.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/174-0
00:37:10.897 --> 00:37:16.212
<v Marwan Altaie>You can always add them as a group weapon,
debt calls or joint calls. Yeah, yeah. OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/174-1
00:37:16.212 --> 00:37:19.735
<v Marwan Altaie>So we do. Yeah, that's good.
Show partner nuances. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/174-2
00:37:19.735 --> 00:37:24.617
<v Marwan Altaie>something like that could add in credit
control as a stakeholder. Yep. Please.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/175-0
00:37:27.097 --> 00:37:31.063
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it just for visibility to prep them
when something's about to be ready or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/175-1
00:37:31.063 --> 00:37:35.131
<v Marwan Altaie>when the status of something's changed?
It's mainly like collaborating like on</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/175-2
00:37:35.131 --> 00:37:39.200
<v Marwan Altaie>the same partners, but from both ends.
So from the whip side and from the debt</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/175-3
00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:39.457
<v Marwan Altaie>side.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/176-0
00:37:42.337 --> 00:37:43.937
<v Marwan Altaie>And then also if there's any sort of?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/177-0
00:37:45.337 --> 00:37:49.459
<v Marwan Altaie>You know specific practises that need
additional support or specific partners</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/177-1
00:37:49.459 --> 00:37:53.211
<v Marwan Altaie>that need additional support.
It tends to be the same on the debt side</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/177-2
00:37:53.211 --> 00:37:57.015
<v Marwan Altaie>as in the website. OK, yeah, no,
of course we could add credit control.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/177-3
00:37:57.015 --> 00:38:00.556
<v Marwan Altaie>So the whip of the debt,
the whip of the credit control teams have</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/177-4
00:38:00.556 --> 00:38:01.137
<v Marwan Altaie>started to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/178-0
00:38:01.777 --> 00:38:05.815
<v Marwan Altaie>Sometimes meet with a business manager
together to try and get a more holistic</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/178-1
00:38:05.815 --> 00:38:09.648
<v Marwan Altaie>view of our matters so we understand the
whip of the debt. As Kirsty says,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/178-2
00:38:09.648 --> 00:38:12.357
<v Marwan Altaie>more often than not,
if the partners crack the whip,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/178-3
00:38:12.357 --> 00:38:16.395
<v Marwan Altaie>they're going to crack the debt as well.
It's just all those things that makes</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/178-4
00:38:16.395 --> 00:38:18.797
<v Marwan Altaie>sense.
So you already have those kind of inter</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/178-5
00:38:18.797 --> 00:38:20.177
<v Marwan Altaie>team processes starting to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/179-0
00:38:21.257 --> 00:38:24.033
<v Marwan Altaie>It's just it's starting,
which is great to say.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/179-1
00:38:24.033 --> 00:38:28.313
<v Marwan Altaie>It's really it's encouraging sort of
products of how we're working at the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/179-2
00:38:28.313 --> 00:38:33.055
<v Marwan Altaie>moment. It's sort of happening in pockets,
but we're gradually seeing it more and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/179-3
00:38:33.055 --> 00:38:37.566
<v Marwan Altaie>more globally and more and more as we
identify those partners who may be more</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/179-4
00:38:37.566 --> 00:38:39.937
<v Marwan Altaie>of a challenge that bit extra support of.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/180-0
00:38:40.137 --> 00:38:43.603
<v Marwan Altaie>And we're going in together a bit of A
tag team pincer effort, if you like.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/180-1
00:38:43.603 --> 00:38:46.522
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm just thinking as well from a
reporting perspective as well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/180-2
00:38:46.522 --> 00:38:49.577
<v Marwan Altaie>We've talked kind of like these
overarching finance dashboards and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/180-3
00:38:49.577 --> 00:38:51.995
<v Marwan Altaie>reports, which we've kind of talked about.
You know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/180-4
00:38:51.995 --> 00:38:55.552
<v Marwan Altaie>the kind of whip and credit control
together you can kind of see that kind of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/180-5
00:38:55.552 --> 00:38:59.155
<v Marwan Altaie>single view and then you can kind of
approach the partners and PES in a single</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/180-6
00:38:59.155 --> 00:38:59.337
<v Marwan Altaie>way.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/181-0
00:38:59.857 --> 00:39:02.657
<v Marwan Altaie>So I've captured that as a points take
away as well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/182-0
00:39:05.537 --> 00:39:08.487
<v Marwan Altaie>I know I'm simplifying a lot,
but at a very basic level.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/182-1
00:39:08.487 --> 00:39:12.421
<v Marwan Altaie>Would a notification be enough if
something has changed in a web status and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/182-2
00:39:12.421 --> 00:39:15.112
<v Marwan Altaie>you just pick out an e-mail to a credit
controller?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/182-3
00:39:15.112 --> 00:39:19.097
<v Marwan Altaie>Or is credit controller have actual
processes and actions dependent on them?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/183-0
00:39:21.257 --> 00:39:23.137
<v Marwan Altaie>Just for the whip stage,
not for the credit control stage.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/184-0
00:39:25.017 --> 00:39:25.817
<v Marwan Altaie>You care about the.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/185-0
00:39:27.617 --> 00:39:28.497
<v Marwan Altaie>That's probably not.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/186-0
00:39:30.537 --> 00:39:35.543
<v Marwan Altaie>You've run off the invoice metric FTG
microphone. Oh, sorry. Sorry.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/186-1
00:39:35.543 --> 00:39:40.843
<v Marwan Altaie>Let even see you comment. Sorry.
Obviously all over the place to be run</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/186-2
00:39:40.843 --> 00:39:41.137
<v Marwan Altaie>off.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/187-0
00:39:42.417 --> 00:39:47.140
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that working? Yeah. Does that mean?
Yeah, the invoice metric report which,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/187-1
00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.894
<v Marwan Altaie>like the web report,
is every open and collectible invoice on</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/187-2
00:39:50.894 --> 00:39:53.922
<v Marwan Altaie>the Ledger.
So once the invoice says collectible,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/187-3
00:39:53.922 --> 00:39:55.617
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll have visibility of it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/188-0
00:39:57.537 --> 00:39:59.708
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.
Is that something that we can see or is</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/188-1
00:39:59.708 --> 00:40:02.620
<v Marwan Altaie>that yeah, yeah, yeah, it does.
It doesn't have to be now,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/188-2
00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:06.370
<v Marwan Altaie>but just afterwards distributability so
that that gets refreshed every day.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/188-3
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.922
<v Marwan Altaie>So payments collected, you know,
anything that's been newly applied and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/188-4
00:40:09.922 --> 00:40:12.291
<v Marwan Altaie>will be reflected on that on a daily
basis. OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/188-5
00:40:12.291 --> 00:40:16.337
<v Marwan Altaie>So that's the master report on the credit
control side. That's the equivalent of.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/189-0
00:40:16.977 --> 00:40:20.087
<v Marwan Altaie>What the whip team have,
but it's actually pulling the information</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/189-1
00:40:20.087 --> 00:40:22.826
<v Marwan Altaie>for three. That's the difference.
So it's a static report,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/189-2
00:40:22.826 --> 00:40:26.633
<v Marwan Altaie>just pulling it basically just mass pulls
all the collections information we have</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/189-3
00:40:26.633 --> 00:40:29.372
<v Marwan Altaie>in three into an Excel spreadsheet just
so we can view it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/189-4
00:40:29.372 --> 00:40:32.946
<v Marwan Altaie>But the information is actually all in
three and that information is entered</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/189-5
00:40:32.946 --> 00:40:33.457
<v Marwan Altaie>into three.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/190-0
00:40:33.817 --> 00:40:36.431
<v Marwan Altaie>Whereas in their whip side,
they're entering excel,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/190-1
00:40:36.431 --> 00:40:40.000
<v Marwan Altaie>the collection side is all three,
so information to three reported out</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/190-2
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.519
<v Marwan Altaie>today on the spreadsheets and processes.
At the moment that you have,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/190-3
00:40:43.519 --> 00:40:47.591
<v Marwan Altaie>is it easy to identify kind of the whip
to credit control transition or are they</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/190-4
00:40:47.591 --> 00:40:48.697
<v Marwan Altaie>separate spreadsheets?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/191-0
00:40:49.017 --> 00:40:53.084
<v Marwan Altaie>Just separate spreadsheets completely, OK,
there's no link between them.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/191-1
00:40:53.084 --> 00:40:55.981
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that data in scope for EDP?
Do you know? I mean,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/191-2
00:40:55.981 --> 00:41:00.494
<v Marwan Altaie>there's a plan to have that going for
three into the new data platform. And yes.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/191-3
00:41:00.494 --> 00:41:04.617
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. So that, so that is a use case,
it's in. Certainly should be, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/193-0
00:41:05.337 --> 00:41:09.013
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. What level of detail?
I don't know whether it be matter level</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/193-1
00:41:09.013 --> 00:41:12.202
<v Marwan Altaie>or invoice level.
I don't know even just the base data set</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/193-2
00:41:12.202 --> 00:41:16.527
<v Marwan Altaie>that's in three would get as a minimum
would be pushed across because it sounds</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/193-3
00:41:16.527 --> 00:41:20.257
<v Marwan Altaie>like there needs to be a migration plan
for your team's spreadsheet.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/194-0
00:41:22.537 --> 00:41:26.858
<v Marwan Altaie>So I shall ask that question too.
I think just one thing for my</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/194-1
00:41:26.858 --> 00:41:32.124
<v Marwan Altaie>understanding is a lot of that stuff
obviously sits outside and there's no in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/194-2
00:41:32.124 --> 00:41:35.162
<v Marwan Altaie>terms of that sort of I guess you would
use,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/194-3
00:41:35.162 --> 00:41:38.537
<v Marwan Altaie>you would raise a task on the billing
team to do.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/195-0
00:41:38.897 --> 00:41:44.012
<v Marwan Altaie>Things and that will go into service now,
but a lot of that stuff sets certainly</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/195-1
00:41:44.012 --> 00:41:48.117
<v Marwan Altaie>for phase one outside of the core sort of
service now workflows.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/195-2
00:41:48.117 --> 00:41:53.043
<v Marwan Altaie>So I think the key thing is to for us to
uncover where those handoffs are and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/195-3
00:41:53.043 --> 00:41:57.716
<v Marwan Altaie>where that becomes an engagement with a
team that's already in the scope.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/195-4
00:41:57.716 --> 00:41:58.537
<v Marwan Altaie>It's not for.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/196-0
00:41:58.617 --> 00:42:02.611
<v Marwan Altaie>For us to sit and work out how we fix
spreadsheets or how we track spreadsheets,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/196-1
00:42:02.611 --> 00:42:05.027
<v Marwan Altaie>I think that needs to be a broader
conversation.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/196-2
00:42:05.027 --> 00:42:09.021
<v Marwan Altaie>My last point would be is there a end to
end process map for all those different</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/196-3
00:42:09.021 --> 00:42:13.065
<v Marwan Altaie>handovers and conversations and stuff in
terms of letters on weekly meetings with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/196-4
00:42:13.065 --> 00:42:15.629
<v Marwan Altaie>certain stakeholders,
monthly meetings with others.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/196-5
00:42:15.629 --> 00:42:17.897
<v Marwan Altaie>Just take in terms of how that whole sort
of.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/197-0
00:42:18.137 --> 00:42:22.292
<v Marwan Altaie>Engagement piece goes and who touches the
spreadsheet when and there's probably not,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/197-1
00:42:22.292 --> 00:42:26.299
<v Marwan Altaie>but we could not one up fairly quickly
between us. Yeah, Disney has to be pretty.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/197-2
00:42:26.299 --> 00:42:30.209
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean, yeah, we could give you that.
Yeah, just something that helps me. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/197-3
00:42:30.209 --> 00:42:33.924
<v Marwan Altaie>That. Thank you. We'll take that away.
I guess that's a good point actually</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/197-4
00:42:33.924 --> 00:42:34.217
<v Marwan Altaie>being.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/198-0
00:42:35.617 --> 00:42:39.257
<v Marwan Altaie>The credit controller website are very
different to the to the other functions</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/198-1
00:42:39.257 --> 00:42:42.436
<v Marwan Altaie>that we've done because rather than
people logging requests with us,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/198-2
00:42:42.436 --> 00:42:46.076
<v Marwan Altaie>a lot of our interaction is actually
going out to the business and asking them</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/198-3
00:42:46.076 --> 00:42:48.610
<v Marwan Altaie>to do things.
We're asking partners or peas or clients</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/198-4
00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.974
<v Marwan Altaie>rather than people coming to us and
asking us to do things that probably</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/198-5
00:42:51.974 --> 00:42:55.337
<v Marwan Altaie>doesn't happen quite as often.
And that's probably how we differentiate.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/199-0
00:42:55.417 --> 00:42:58.558
<v Marwan Altaie>Between the US and the other teams,
that's probably why. What is?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/199-1
00:42:58.558 --> 00:43:01.985
<v Marwan Altaie>Why we're not on share? Well now,
because there's not really a need for</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/199-2
00:43:01.985 --> 00:43:06.031
<v Marwan Altaie>people to raise requests. That being said,
as we looked at today and we will look at</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/199-3
00:43:06.031 --> 00:43:08.839
<v Marwan Altaie>credit control later,
there is touch points between US and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/199-4
00:43:08.839 --> 00:43:12.742
<v Marwan Altaie>other teams and that's probably where I
think that's the focus is to record those</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/199-5
00:43:12.742 --> 00:43:15.217
<v Marwan Altaie>interactions,
which is why the credit control side.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/200-0
00:43:15.377 --> 00:43:18.887
<v Marwan Altaie>Looking at certain processes only that
will probably more lend themselves to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/200-1
00:43:18.887 --> 00:43:22.488
<v Marwan Altaie>that rather than what we talked about.
The overall credit control process that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/200-2
00:43:22.488 --> 00:43:25.177
<v Marwan Altaie>is only relevant if we've got the
integrations, of course.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/201-0
00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:26.777
<v Marwan Altaie>Oh.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/202-0
00:43:29.017 --> 00:43:32.205
<v Marwan Altaie>I think we're good for that bit for now.
Like I said,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/202-1
00:43:32.205 --> 00:43:35.038
<v Marwan Altaie>the whip was quite small section for the
as is.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/202-2
00:43:35.038 --> 00:43:39.111
<v Marwan Altaie>Is everyone happy where we're at in terms
of the teams, the process,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/202-3
00:43:39.111 --> 00:43:42.475
<v Marwan Altaie>the kind of data points,
what we can and can't do from a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/202-4
00:43:42.475 --> 00:43:44.777
<v Marwan Altaie>functional perspective and the reports.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/203-0
00:43:45.937 --> 00:43:48.397
<v Marwan Altaie>Everyone's nodding. Lovely.
So like I said,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/203-1
00:43:48.397 --> 00:43:52.758
<v Marwan Altaie>it's a very basic solution that I'm
proposing and this definitely needs to be</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/203-2
00:43:52.758 --> 00:43:57.231
<v Marwan Altaie>a discussion area where everyone inputs.
I want to see if we're going the right</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/203-3
00:43:57.231 --> 00:44:00.977
<v Marwan Altaie>direction, if it's a waste of time,
if we've identified the right.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/204-0
00:44:01.137 --> 00:44:04.206
<v Marwan Altaie>Use cases.
So ultimately what I've said is in scope</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/204-1
00:44:04.206 --> 00:44:08.160
<v Marwan Altaie>is we're supporting the web team,
but we're not changing anything.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/204-2
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.409
<v Marwan Altaie>Your processes remain as they are and
we're not doing additional admin.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/204-3
00:44:12.409 --> 00:44:17.367
<v Marwan Altaie>This is purely to identify and pick up on
certain web topics or certain web matters</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/204-4
00:44:17.367 --> 00:44:19.137
<v Marwan Altaie>that you deem useful to track.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/205-0
00:44:19.497 --> 00:44:23.362
<v Marwan Altaie>And essentially everything becomes
centralised within ServiceNow.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/205-1
00:44:23.362 --> 00:44:26.875
<v Marwan Altaie>So your communications, your information,
who submitted it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/205-2
00:44:26.875 --> 00:44:29.510
<v Marwan Altaie>and that will be done with a simple
tracker.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/205-3
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:34.136
<v Marwan Altaie>But I'll show you roughly how I think it
could work and out of scope is, yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/205-4
00:44:34.136 --> 00:44:38.937
<v Marwan Altaie>changing how billing or E billing done,
any integration or automations or moving.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/206-0
00:44:39.017 --> 00:44:42.766
<v Marwan Altaie>Your data or spreadsheets everything
remains as is for this phase of the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/206-1
00:44:42.766 --> 00:44:43.177
<v Marwan Altaie>project.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/207-0
00:44:45.177 --> 00:44:48.791
<v Marwan Altaie>I just ask a question,
sorry before we move on on the shared</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/207-1
00:44:48.791 --> 00:44:52.998
<v Marwan Altaie>mailbox that you have Kirsty.
So what kind of communications is it was</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/207-2
00:44:52.998 --> 00:44:56.494
<v Marwan Altaie>in there on that.
So that's where our BU emails go out of.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/207-3
00:44:56.494 --> 00:45:01.293
<v Marwan Altaie>So we normally copy in the inbox just to
keep a track of the emails and audit so</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/207-4
00:45:01.293 --> 00:45:04.137
<v Marwan Altaie>we know what's going on and what's come
in. OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/208-0
00:45:05.697 --> 00:45:10.145
<v Marwan Altaie>There's some sort of wider finance emails
that come into that inbox as well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/208-1
00:45:10.145 --> 00:45:14.997
<v Marwan Altaie>So state of place and to do a target sort
of day one emails they come in that inbox</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/208-2
00:45:14.997 --> 00:45:18.867
<v Marwan Altaie>to keep us up to date, OK.
And then are you taking actions off the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/208-3
00:45:18.867 --> 00:45:23.373
<v Marwan Altaie>back of those emails coming in and out?
So I'm guessing you're initiating the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/208-4
00:45:23.373 --> 00:45:23.777
<v Marwan Altaie>e-mail.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/210-0
00:45:23.897 --> 00:45:26.935
<v Marwan Altaie>Right. And you're sending it out.
You send it out from your personal</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/210-1
00:45:26.935 --> 00:45:30.413
<v Marwan Altaie>mailbox? Yeah. Copy in the shared mailbox.
OK. And is there a reason for that?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/210-2
00:45:30.413 --> 00:45:33.451
<v Marwan Altaie>So that when people are off,
because we often get if one of the team</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/210-3
00:45:33.451 --> 00:45:37.061
<v Marwan Altaie>goes off and like, who do what do you do?
Who do you do it? We don't have access.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/210-4
00:45:37.061 --> 00:45:40.539
<v Marwan Altaie>So that's why we just copy the revenue
management inbox so that everyone's got</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/210-5
00:45:40.539 --> 00:45:43.137
<v Marwan Altaie>access to that.
So they can see what emails have gone out.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/211-0
00:45:43.617 --> 00:45:46.235
<v Marwan Altaie>Other than that,
or just a kind of dumping around for</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/211-1
00:45:46.235 --> 00:45:50.114
<v Marwan Altaie>useful global emails that come round,
there's probably not really requests that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/211-2
00:45:50.114 --> 00:45:52.247
<v Marwan Altaie>come into it like there is the quick
trial.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/211-3
00:45:52.247 --> 00:45:55.787
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's probably more more just
information and it's there for reference</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/211-4
00:45:55.787 --> 00:45:58.017
<v Marwan Altaie>really.
And is that the kind of stuff that we</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/211-5
00:45:58.017 --> 00:46:01.217
<v Marwan Altaie>want to track through ServiceNow though
and move that mailbox in?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/212-0
00:46:03.737 --> 00:46:04.457
<v Marwan Altaie>Do you have?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/213-0
00:46:07.537 --> 00:46:11.933
<v Marwan Altaie>Because what I'm trying to understand,
for example, is if you send an e-mail out,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/213-1
00:46:11.933 --> 00:46:15.470
<v Marwan Altaie>you copy in the mailbox,
somebody might come back to you and say,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/213-2
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:18.097
<v Marwan Altaie>right,
I'm going to do XY and Z or you're asking</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/213-3
00:46:18.097 --> 00:46:21.259
<v Marwan Altaie>them to do something.
That's the kind of stuff that we can</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/213-4
00:46:21.259 --> 00:46:23.511
<v Marwan Altaie>track.
So particularly if that's going to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/213-5
00:46:23.511 --> 00:46:26.137
<v Marwan Altaie>billing or credit control or E billing
cashiers.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/214-0
00:46:26.537 --> 00:46:30.621
<v Marwan Altaie>We can use that as tasks in there,
so we can actually just send the tasks</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/214-1
00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:34.097
<v Marwan Altaie>across to them rather than having to do
e-mail correspondence.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/215-0
00:46:37.897 --> 00:46:42.102
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it helpful if I explain the proposed
solution because it is in line with that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/215-1
00:46:42.102 --> 00:46:45.999
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So really,
when I say simple, I mean really simple.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/215-2
00:46:45.999 --> 00:46:49.845
<v Marwan Altaie>You're going to service now you click.
I'm just gonna say a button for now</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/215-3
00:46:49.845 --> 00:46:54.049
<v Marwan Altaie>because we haven't actually created it.
You have a location service now you click</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/215-4
00:46:54.049 --> 00:46:57.177
<v Marwan Altaie>for the whip analysts.
They then enter a few pieces of data.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/216-0
00:46:57.577 --> 00:47:01.868
<v Marwan Altaie>Relevant to the whip item,
it creates a task for you to track and in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/216-1
00:47:01.868 --> 00:47:05.662
<v Marwan Altaie>really simple terms,
you can send out emails from ServiceNow</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/216-2
00:47:05.662 --> 00:47:10.823
<v Marwan Altaie>that when the stakeholders or the whip or
the clients or whoever you want responds</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/216-3
00:47:10.823 --> 00:47:14.057
<v Marwan Altaie>to that,
it's automatically tracked on that ticket.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/217-0
00:47:14.457 --> 00:47:17.710
<v Marwan Altaie>So you have a full auditable list of
what's happened, who's done what,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/217-1
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:20.414
<v Marwan Altaie>who's agreed, what,
and it just allows you to assign it to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/217-2
00:47:20.414 --> 00:47:22.842
<v Marwan Altaie>whoever you want.
You can create a centralised team,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/217-3
00:47:22.842 --> 00:47:25.867
<v Marwan Altaie>so if your whip team or your whip
analysts, so if someone is off,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/217-4
00:47:25.867 --> 00:47:29.028
<v Marwan Altaie>you can switch out people.
Everyone will have this ability of it and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/217-5
00:47:29.028 --> 00:47:32.373
<v Marwan Altaie>it won't account for everything because
you do have a lot of whip items.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/217-6
00:47:32.373 --> 00:47:33.977
<v Marwan Altaie>But like you said, for your top 15.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/218-0
00:47:34.377 --> 00:47:37.521
<v Marwan Altaie>Or you're even top on 135 if you want to
include it in here.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/218-1
00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:41.387
<v Marwan Altaie>It makes it a lot simpler to kind of
track what's happened, what's agreed,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/218-2
00:47:41.387 --> 00:47:44.582
<v Marwan Altaie>and if someone's off,
you're not relying on people picking up</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/218-3
00:47:44.582 --> 00:47:48.242
<v Marwan Altaie>emails or going to that group e-mail,
you're just going to the ticket.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/218-4
00:47:48.242 --> 00:47:50.097
<v Marwan Altaie>So you're centralising that process.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/219-0
00:47:51.897 --> 00:47:56.486
<v Marwan Altaie>How much extra work is that for the team?
If we're going in and login tickets 20</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/219-1
00:47:56.486 --> 00:47:59.489
<v Marwan Altaie>seconds, 30 seconds,
you have your spreadsheet here.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/219-2
00:47:59.489 --> 00:48:04.134
<v Marwan Altaie>You've identified you don't know what's
going on with this or it's just been this</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/219-3
00:48:04.134 --> 00:48:06.457
<v Marwan Altaie>with items just been raised or this is a.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/220-0
00:48:07.297 --> 00:48:09.638
<v Marwan Altaie>£1,000,
000 WIP that you need to get over the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/220-1
00:48:09.638 --> 00:48:12.132
<v Marwan Altaie>line you go in,
you enter four or five pieces of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/220-2
00:48:12.132 --> 00:48:15.745
<v Marwan Altaie>information and the information is just
for your reference within WIP.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/220-3
00:48:15.745 --> 00:48:18.646
<v Marwan Altaie>So when you go in,
you'll have lines of different ticket</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/220-4
00:48:18.646 --> 00:48:22.768
<v Marwan Altaie>items that you can philtre through and
you just e-mail instead of outlook you're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/220-5
00:48:22.768 --> 00:48:26.737
<v Marwan Altaie>emailing from here and it's centralising
all of that information and keeping.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/221-0
00:48:26.897 --> 00:48:30.322
<v Marwan Altaie>All of the visibility and tracking it in
one central location,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/221-1
00:48:30.322 --> 00:48:34.670
<v Marwan Altaie>it's it might look like it's quite a lot,
but in reality it's literally four or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/221-2
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:37.878
<v Marwan Altaie>five fields you're entering.
And instead of using outlook,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/221-3
00:48:37.878 --> 00:48:41.737
<v Marwan Altaie>you're just using service now.
But it does give a lot more visibility.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/222-0
00:48:42.017 --> 00:48:44.137
<v Marwan Altaie>Of what's going on, who's responded,
who's done what?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/223-0
00:48:45.697 --> 00:48:48.488
<v Marwan Altaie>Do you use e-mail templates that end just
now?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/223-1
00:48:48.488 --> 00:48:52.822
<v Marwan Altaie>Like is it standard stuff that you're
always asking off the back of your</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/223-2
00:48:52.822 --> 00:48:57.394
<v Marwan Altaie>spreadsheet? Or is it all verbatim?
It's sort of very tailored questions now</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/223-3
00:48:57.394 --> 00:49:00.897
<v Marwan Altaie>that we're trying to ask,
so it depends on the bar really.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/224-0
00:49:01.297 --> 00:49:04.452
<v Marwan Altaie>The question there used to be a sort of
more template form,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/224-1
00:49:04.452 --> 00:49:08.500
<v Marwan Altaie>but we've moved away from that. OK,
try to tailor it more to get because the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/224-2
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:12.390
<v Marwan Altaie>problem is if partners just get generic
emails, they tend to ignore them.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/224-3
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:16.491
<v Marwan Altaie>So we're getting the team to actually
send tailored questions to the partner.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/224-4
00:49:16.491 --> 00:49:19.488
<v Marwan Altaie>Now, you know,
you mentioned this last month, partner A,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/224-5
00:49:19.488 --> 00:49:20.697
<v Marwan Altaie>is this still on board?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/225-0
00:49:20.737 --> 00:49:23.895
<v Marwan Altaie>You know we're, you know,
we're worried about this. You know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/225-1
00:49:23.895 --> 00:49:26.900
<v Marwan Altaie>the government,
in whatever country is going to crash now,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/225-2
00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:29.446
<v Marwan Altaie>shouldn't be worried about the whip.
We're going.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/225-3
00:49:29.446 --> 00:49:33.572
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's more tailored depending on the
matter. A couple of questions about this.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/225-4
00:49:33.572 --> 00:49:36.780
<v Marwan Altaie>I guess. First of all,
there's going to be no whip information</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/225-5
00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.257
<v Marwan Altaie>held in service now is there?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/226-0
00:49:38.777 --> 00:49:42.897
<v Marwan Altaie>So this information is purely manual,
manual, correct?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/227-0
00:49:46.217 --> 00:49:49.288
<v Marwan Altaie>The team send out emails that cover a
matter,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/227-1
00:49:49.288 --> 00:49:54.762
<v Marwan Altaie>but they also send out emails that might
go to a partner that cover OP that cover</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/227-2
00:49:54.762 --> 00:49:55.897
<v Marwan Altaie>multiple matters.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/228-0
00:49:57.297 --> 00:50:01.150
<v Marwan Altaie>So the ServiceNow functionality for the
most part and again we can change the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/228-1
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:04.854
<v Marwan Altaie>fields either just my suggestion,
so we can create different tickets types</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/228-2
00:50:04.854 --> 00:50:07.620
<v Marwan Altaie>if you want to call them that.
This could be more whip,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/228-3
00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:11.523
<v Marwan Altaie>you can have a partner specific one,
but for the most part the e-mail acts the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/228-4
00:50:11.523 --> 00:50:14.437
<v Marwan Altaie>same as outlook.
So we can have templates structured in or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/228-5
00:50:14.437 --> 00:50:16.857
<v Marwan Altaie>you could just have it as an open e-mail
coming.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/229-0
00:50:17.057 --> 00:50:19.915
<v Marwan Altaie>From a group mailbox,
if you want to call it that,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/229-1
00:50:19.915 --> 00:50:24.511
<v Marwan Altaie>it's the main benefit and it comes down
to do you is it worth having this tracked</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/229-2
00:50:24.511 --> 00:50:29.163
<v Marwan Altaie>in the system or is it not enough of an
issue? That's what it comes down to. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/229-3
00:50:29.163 --> 00:50:32.862
<v Marwan Altaie>I got here missing emails.
Are you spending loads of time looking</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/229-4
00:50:32.862 --> 00:50:36.617
<v Marwan Altaie>for approval so you're not sure what the
last status of something?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/230-0
00:50:36.657 --> 00:50:39.159
<v Marwan Altaie>Was are you resending the same request to
a partner?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/230-1
00:50:39.159 --> 00:50:41.331
<v Marwan Altaie>Are you sending the same request to a
client?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/230-2
00:50:41.331 --> 00:50:45.060
<v Marwan Altaie>Those kind of things like more human
error like just not tracking items. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/230-3
00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:48.412
<v Marwan Altaie>and I guess we record that information at
the moment in a spreadsheet.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/230-4
00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:52.236
<v Marwan Altaie>It is that we see the notes. You know,
if you recurse these notes to send e-mail</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/230-5
00:50:52.236 --> 00:50:55.257
<v Marwan Altaie>out. Second, sending out fifth,
something whatever it might be.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/231-0
00:50:56.057 --> 00:50:57.257
<v Marwan Altaie>And I guess that would do this job.</v>

00:51:01.497 --> 00:51:02.177
<v Marwan Altaie>I guess.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/234-0
00:51:04.577 --> 00:51:07.665
<v Marwan Altaie>The the difficulty is,
I think with the matters of partners,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/234-1
00:51:07.665 --> 00:51:10.752
<v Marwan Altaie>because you might do the part,
the emails are very sporadic,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/234-2
00:51:10.752 --> 00:51:14.498
<v Marwan Altaie>so and they're not necessarily set,
but you might send out an e-mail to a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/234-3
00:51:14.498 --> 00:51:18.547
<v Marwan Altaie>partner that covers multiple matters,
in which case that makes it quite hard to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/234-4
00:51:18.547 --> 00:51:20.217
<v Marwan Altaie>track because you're going to be.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/235-0
00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:24.586
<v Marwan Altaie>You know you're looking for five matters
under one partner when you're sending one</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/235-1
00:51:24.586 --> 00:51:26.834
<v Marwan Altaie>e-mail,
then another one might be specific about</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/235-2
00:51:26.834 --> 00:51:30.414
<v Marwan Altaie>another matter or you might go to APE.
That might be across multiple partners</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/235-3
00:51:30.414 --> 00:51:33.855
<v Marwan Altaie>and across multiple matters. Now,
how easy is that going to be to track in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/235-4
00:51:33.855 --> 00:51:37.618
<v Marwan Altaie>a system when you're trying to work out
without actually entering in every single</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/235-5
00:51:37.618 --> 00:51:38.857
<v Marwan Altaie>matter number you're doing?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/236-0
00:51:40.097 --> 00:51:43.868
<v Marwan Altaie>And if you're going to do that by the
time you've done that,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/236-1
00:51:43.868 --> 00:51:47.886
<v Marwan Altaie>are you saving any time? Maybe not.
I don't know if you were to,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/236-2
00:51:47.886 --> 00:51:52.646
<v Marwan Altaie>I was going to ask in terms of when
you're doing all of that work and you've</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/236-3
00:51:52.646 --> 00:51:55.737
<v Marwan Altaie>only got 5 people at the moment. Yeah,
let's say.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/237-0
00:51:56.817 --> 00:51:59.403
<v Marwan Altaie>Making this up,
let's say Asha's plans to expand and you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/237-1
00:51:59.403 --> 00:52:02.670
<v Marwan Altaie>get another law firm that gets embodied
in. Yeah, how are you going to?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/237-2
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:05.529
<v Marwan Altaie>How do we justify that? Actually,
five's not enough. Actually,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/237-3
00:52:05.529 --> 00:52:08.614
<v Marwan Altaie>we're struggling already. How?
How are someone going to support the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/237-4
00:52:08.614 --> 00:52:11.654
<v Marwan Altaie>additional whip that you're planning to
come and throw us as well?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/237-5
00:52:11.654 --> 00:52:14.921
<v Marwan Altaie>So this is where we say, well,
we can only cover so much that we've got</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/237-6
00:52:14.921 --> 00:52:15.057
<v Marwan Altaie>so.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/238-0
00:52:16.577 --> 00:52:19.341
<v Marwan Altaie>We, the management,
are aware we can only cover some new</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/238-1
00:52:19.341 --> 00:52:21.814
<v Marwan Altaie>matters,
don't have capacity to come more in terms</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/238-2
00:52:21.814 --> 00:52:25.208
<v Marwan Altaie>of justifying the head count,
you mean we don't have to take our word</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/238-3
00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:26.857
<v Marwan Altaie>for it. We'll take my word for it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/239-0
00:52:28.497 --> 00:52:30.150
<v Marwan Altaie>So,
because that's one of the things that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/239-1
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:33.377
<v Marwan Altaie>this starts to actually put some facts
and figures behind it. Absolutely. No, no,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/239-2
00:52:33.377 --> 00:52:36.210
<v Marwan Altaie>no. I'm not against using this.
What I worry is we're actually going to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/239-3
00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:38.335
<v Marwan Altaie>make you more work than we can have in
the 1st place.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/239-4
00:52:38.335 --> 00:52:41.405
<v Marwan Altaie>It feels like we're going from sending
out an e-mail and recording what we're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/239-5
00:52:41.405 --> 00:52:43.490
<v Marwan Altaie>doing to sending out and recording what
we're doing,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/239-6
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:45.497
<v Marwan Altaie>but also entering information into the
ServiceNow.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/240-0
00:52:45.857 --> 00:52:48.503
<v Marwan Altaie>And and yes, you're only doing it,
say once per e-mail,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/240-1
00:52:48.503 --> 00:52:51.149
<v Marwan Altaie>but if you're sending out 30 emails per
day per person,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/240-2
00:52:51.149 --> 00:52:54.787
<v Marwan Altaie>and you have a team of five people,
you're suddenly multiply that and you're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/240-3
00:52:54.787 --> 00:52:56.866
<v Marwan Altaie>you're creating a lot of work for
yourself,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/240-4
00:52:56.866 --> 00:52:59.985
<v Marwan Altaie>and I'm worried about the crossover of
matters, partners and PES,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/240-5
00:52:59.985 --> 00:53:00.977
<v Marwan Altaie>where you're crossed.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/241-0
00:53:01.297 --> 00:53:04.340
<v Marwan Altaie>Multiple it's not necessarily 1 to one
ratio, so then you're losing.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/241-1
00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.677
<v Marwan Altaie>Your benefits,
are very easy looking up and tracking</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/241-2
00:53:06.677 --> 00:53:09.014
<v Marwan Altaie>stuff. Sure,
because you might have one case that's,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/241-3
00:53:09.014 --> 00:53:11.792
<v Marwan Altaie>you know, five matters,
but you get one but not the other four</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/241-4
00:53:11.792 --> 00:53:15.364
<v Marwan Altaie>and you just split them out and you're
gonna spend a lot of time trying to split</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/241-5
00:53:15.364 --> 00:53:15.937
<v Marwan Altaie>it all up so.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/242-0
00:53:16.937 --> 00:53:17.137
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/243-0
00:53:18.697 --> 00:53:21.695
<v Marwan Altaie>This isn't set in stone.
That's that's a very, very valid point.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/243-1
00:53:21.695 --> 00:53:25.430
<v Marwan Altaie>We'll take that away and I'll consider if
is that your biggest concern with this</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/243-2
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:28.889
<v Marwan Altaie>solution or is it the double entry?
I'm just trying to understand if we're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/243-3
00:53:28.889 --> 00:53:31.471
<v Marwan Altaie>going, it's not,
it's the time consuming and the double</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/243-4
00:53:31.471 --> 00:53:33.777
<v Marwan Altaie>entry, the double entry.
Obviously the impact is.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/244-0
00:53:34.297 --> 00:53:37.397
<v Marwan Altaie>How much time it's taking?
I have a question, sorry.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/244-1
00:53:37.397 --> 00:53:40.905
<v Marwan Altaie>It's either due date.
What could someone explain that to me</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/244-2
00:53:40.905 --> 00:53:43.771
<v Marwan Altaie>please?
So due dates could be when the whip item</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/244-3
00:53:43.771 --> 00:53:47.806
<v Marwan Altaie>is due due date could also be changed to
when it needs to be raised.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/244-4
00:53:47.806 --> 00:53:52.426
<v Marwan Altaie>These again these fields are just high
level what I'm suggesting we can change</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/244-5
00:53:52.426 --> 00:53:53.537
<v Marwan Altaie>them to align with.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/245-0
00:53:53.577 --> 00:53:57.666
<v Marwan Altaie>Where it's just what I thought could be
beneficial, like a manual follow-up date.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/245-1
00:53:57.666 --> 00:54:01.506
<v Marwan Altaie>It could be like a reminder. For example,
if you sent an e-mail and said oh,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/245-2
00:54:01.506 --> 00:54:04.847
<v Marwan Altaie>that matter closes in March 2026,
you put it to 1st of March 2026,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/245-3
00:54:04.847 --> 00:54:08.737
<v Marwan Altaie>then you could follow up then then it
pops back in report that says again so.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/246-0
00:54:09.497 --> 00:54:13.055
<v Marwan Altaie>You can have a whole report that says OK,
give enough of sequence how I want to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/246-1
00:54:13.055 --> 00:54:15.990
<v Marwan Altaie>progress work based on this you know due
date I can go. OK, well,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/246-2
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:19.147
<v Marwan Altaie>I've logged in in the morning.
I can see which of the ones that I want</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/246-3
00:54:19.147 --> 00:54:22.127
<v Marwan Altaie>to prioritise right now.
So just helps you to kind of very quickly</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/246-4
00:54:22.127 --> 00:54:25.017
<v Marwan Altaie>start to look through some of these these
matters as well. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/247-0
00:54:25.497 --> 00:54:28.770
<v Marwan Altaie>I can see the benefit,
but I'm also just slightly concerned that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/247-1
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:32.596
<v Marwan Altaie>it would start flagging up things when
we've already got a spreadsheet that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/247-2
00:54:32.596 --> 00:54:36.573
<v Marwan Altaie>we're tracking everything on that like
allows us to see what we need to follow</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/247-3
00:54:36.573 --> 00:54:38.788
<v Marwan Altaie>up.
So then you're looking at a spreadsheet</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/247-4
00:54:38.788 --> 00:54:41.406
<v Marwan Altaie>saying, OK,
I've got all this to follow up and then</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/247-5
00:54:41.406 --> 00:54:43.017
<v Marwan Altaie>you've got reminders popping up.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/249-0
00:54:43.497 --> 00:54:48.381
<v Marwan Altaie>So you need to follow this up and it just
so is that remainder spreadsheet part of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/249-1
00:54:48.381 --> 00:54:52.913
<v Marwan Altaie>the wider ones we've already talked about
or is that a separate stand alone,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/249-2
00:54:52.913 --> 00:54:57.797
<v Marwan Altaie>the significant WEP? It's not reminders,
it's more just the way that we rag things</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/249-3
00:54:57.797 --> 00:55:00.857
<v Marwan Altaie>and we follow up.
We'd know based on how we rag it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/250-0
00:55:01.577 --> 00:55:05.047
<v Marwan Altaie>When we need to follow up, for example,
if you've got so this month, for example,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/250-1
00:55:05.047 --> 00:55:07.924
<v Marwan Altaie>Mark's asked us to get all the billing
estimates from the partners.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/250-2
00:55:07.924 --> 00:55:11.267
<v Marwan Altaie>So what we do is just we could go to the
spreadsheet, look at all the matters,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/250-3
00:55:11.267 --> 00:55:14.271
<v Marwan Altaie>philtre it by what we know is,
could we build this month based on what</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/250-4
00:55:14.271 --> 00:55:16.217
<v Marwan Altaie>we've been told,
where it hasn't been billed.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/251-0
00:55:16.497 --> 00:55:20.906
<v Marwan Altaie>And then we can target those matters that
that should be built this month that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/251-1
00:55:20.906 --> 00:55:24.199
<v Marwan Altaie>haven't been, yeah.
So the problem is that so for example,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/251-2
00:55:24.199 --> 00:55:28.609
<v Marwan Altaie>if that was a stand alone tracker that
you were using to track those dates and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/251-3
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:31.120
<v Marwan Altaie>stuff,
it might make more sense to put it in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/251-4
00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.632
<v Marwan Altaie>here.
But because it's attached to the wider</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/251-5
00:55:33.632 --> 00:55:35.697
<v Marwan Altaie>report that we can actually recreate.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/252-0
00:55:36.297 --> 00:55:39.037
<v Marwan Altaie>Because you've got status,
so it's not just a simple case of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/252-1
00:55:39.037 --> 00:55:42.541
<v Marwan Altaie>one-on-one. So there's a lot of data,
stuff like completion dates that you're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/252-2
00:55:42.541 --> 00:55:44.877
<v Marwan Altaie>putting for three.
So when it when a match is open,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/252-3
00:55:44.877 --> 00:55:48.247
<v Marwan Altaie>someone will give a completion date when
they and they think it's going to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/252-4
00:55:48.247 --> 00:55:50.313
<v Marwan Altaie>complete.
Now those dates are not necessarily</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/252-5
00:55:50.313 --> 00:55:50.897
<v Marwan Altaie>correct, but.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/253-0
00:55:51.897 --> 00:55:54.366
<v Marwan Altaie>You can't need to bring that information
into this as well,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/253-1
00:55:54.366 --> 00:55:57.493
<v Marwan Altaie>because then what you could do is that
could pop up a due date would be the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/253-2
00:55:57.493 --> 00:55:59.674
<v Marwan Altaie>completion date,
and then you've got your task then.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/253-3
00:55:59.674 --> 00:56:01.854
<v Marwan Altaie>But again,
that's probably a lot more to do with the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/253-4
00:56:01.854 --> 00:56:04.282
<v Marwan Altaie>integration bit.
Is that because you need that information</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/253-5
00:56:04.282 --> 00:56:06.668
<v Marwan Altaie>to drive it and that's where you get your
real value now?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/253-6
00:56:06.668 --> 00:56:09.137
<v Marwan Altaie>Because I'm just thinking because I'm
wondering whether we.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/254-0
00:56:09.697 --> 00:56:13.772
<v Marwan Altaie>Try and do some form of digitization of
your spreadsheet itself rather than</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/254-1
00:56:13.772 --> 00:56:17.043
<v Marwan Altaie>direct link to free,
but if you're already extracting rather</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/254-2
00:56:17.043 --> 00:56:21.494
<v Marwan Altaie>than using the spreadsheet to extract and
then work on you take the extract and we</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/254-3
00:56:21.494 --> 00:56:24.872
<v Marwan Altaie>load it in on a monthly basis.
So it's kind of an integration,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/254-4
00:56:24.872 --> 00:56:27.017
<v Marwan Altaie>but not quite fully integrated, so it's.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/255-0
00:56:27.377 --> 00:56:30.781
<v Marwan Altaie>And then you can kind of just basically
have your spreadsheet all working through</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/255-1
00:56:30.781 --> 00:56:33.065
<v Marwan Altaie>here and triggering the emails and
running everything.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/255-2
00:56:33.065 --> 00:56:36.386
<v Marwan Altaie>So you need the information twice a day
to be updated because it's running live</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/255-3
00:56:36.386 --> 00:56:39.583
<v Marwan Altaie>with data so it would need to be at the
start of Australia Day start UK day.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/255-4
00:56:39.583 --> 00:56:42.738
<v Marwan Altaie>So you'd like to capture with differences
because the problem is things get</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/255-5
00:56:42.738 --> 00:56:45.395
<v Marwan Altaie>building for the month.
You kind of need to keep on top of that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/255-6
00:56:45.395 --> 00:56:47.097
<v Marwan Altaie>so you're you're only following up stuff.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/256-0
00:56:47.257 --> 00:56:51.061
<v Marwan Altaie>That has live whip makes sense,
so we do it at the start of each day now</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/256-1
00:56:51.061 --> 00:56:54.969
<v Marwan Altaie>so that we have that live information and
also you obviously build up whip</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/256-2
00:56:54.969 --> 00:56:58.148
<v Marwan Altaie>throughout the month as well.
So what started off as $1,000,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/256-3
00:56:58.148 --> 00:57:02.369
<v Marwan Altaie>000 this month might only two million,
it's only at the end of the month because</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/256-4
00:57:02.369 --> 00:57:04.297
<v Marwan Altaie>you're taking extracts on the report.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/257-0
00:57:04.897 --> 00:57:07.360
<v Marwan Altaie>Basically, do the same,
just load it into ServiceNow and you can</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/257-1
00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.126
<v Marwan Altaie>run everything through here. It's not.
There's no real difference of it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/257-2
00:57:10.126 --> 00:57:13.346
<v Marwan Altaie>It's just you've got digital way of doing
it. You can control it, you can assign it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/257-3
00:57:13.346 --> 00:57:15.354
<v Marwan Altaie>You can do the emails as you're doing as
well. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/257-4
00:57:15.354 --> 00:57:18.537
<v Marwan Altaie>It means you don't have to worry about it
being all on the spreadsheet as well. So.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/258-0
00:57:19.857 --> 00:57:23.213
<v Marwan Altaie>If we can take that way and have a look
at the spreadsheet that you've got and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/258-1
00:57:23.213 --> 00:57:26.569
<v Marwan Altaie>then look at how do we digitise that for
you and then you've just got that one</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/258-2
00:57:26.569 --> 00:57:28.778
<v Marwan Altaie>digital workspace to everything for all
your teams,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/258-3
00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:31.921
<v Marwan Altaie>you control the access as well.
That might be a slightly better way to do</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/258-4
00:57:31.921 --> 00:57:34.937
<v Marwan Altaie>it rather than what this is doing is
adding admin on top of your real.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/259-0
00:57:35.097 --> 00:57:38.080
<v Marwan Altaie>Day job rather than actually trying to
help you. Yeah, and that's it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/259-1
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:41.702
<v Marwan Altaie>And I think that's what we want to get to,
you know? So I think so at the beginning.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/259-2
00:57:41.702 --> 00:57:44.685
<v Marwan Altaie>It's when it's to add something,
it's gonna take long. Will it? Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/259-3
00:57:44.685 --> 00:57:47.498
<v Marwan Altaie>It's the object somewhat.
But I'm seeing there's there's value in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/259-4
00:57:47.498 --> 00:57:48.137
<v Marwan Altaie>it. Absolutely.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/260-0
00:57:51.217 --> 00:57:56.357
<v Marwan Altaie>Any other questions? Confidentiality.
Earlier on as well and I think you know</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/260-1
00:57:56.357 --> 00:58:00.244
<v Marwan Altaie>we send out these emails,
they've got the matters from the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/260-2
00:58:00.244 --> 00:58:04.527
<v Marwan Altaie>significant Web report.
If we're then putting them in ServiceNow</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/260-3
00:58:04.527 --> 00:58:05.977
<v Marwan Altaie>than they would be in.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/261-0
00:58:06.297 --> 00:58:09.488
<v Marwan Altaie>ServiceNow we,
we can create specific assignment groups,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/261-1
00:58:09.488 --> 00:58:13.574
<v Marwan Altaie>so visibility is locked down to set users.
ServiceNow is quite good with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/261-2
00:58:13.574 --> 00:58:17.604
<v Marwan Altaie>confidentiality and role based access.
So that's a relatively low risk.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/261-3
00:58:17.604 --> 00:58:20.626
<v Marwan Altaie>It actually becomes a little bit easier.
So. So yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/261-4
00:58:20.626 --> 00:58:23.537
<v Marwan Altaie>it actually becomes a bit easier because
we can go.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/262-0
00:58:24.097 --> 00:58:25.971
<v Marwan Altaie>OK,
if you are assigned in that case and you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/262-1
00:58:25.971 --> 00:58:28.262
<v Marwan Altaie>have access,
anyone on the WIP team can see all of the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/262-2
00:58:28.262 --> 00:58:30.469
<v Marwan Altaie>different cases,
but anyone outside it gets limited,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/262-3
00:58:30.469 --> 00:58:32.592
<v Marwan Altaie>so it might be.
If you're finance manager for that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/262-4
00:58:32.592 --> 00:58:35.049
<v Marwan Altaie>particular region,
you would have access to see that data.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/262-5
00:58:35.049 --> 00:58:37.298
<v Marwan Altaie>If you're not,
then you wouldn't be able to see that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/262-6
00:58:37.298 --> 00:58:40.130
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm just I'm making that up,
but there are certain ways that as Mom</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/262-7
00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:42.337
<v Marwan Altaie>talked about,
we can set certain security around it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/263-0
00:58:42.657 --> 00:58:45.104
<v Marwan Altaie>We just need to be very careful how you
want to do that as well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/263-1
00:58:45.104 --> 00:58:48.039
<v Marwan Altaie>We don't want to overly restrict it and
then it makes it harder to do things,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/263-2
00:58:48.039 --> 00:58:50.335
<v Marwan Altaie>but at the same time,
if you do have specific rules and what</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/263-3
00:58:50.335 --> 00:58:52.857
<v Marwan Altaie>you need to put in there,
then we can have a look at that as well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/265-0
00:58:54.817 --> 00:59:01.646
<v Marwan Altaie>In terms of reporting out of service now
I be able to report on every field.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/265-1
00:59:01.646 --> 00:59:08.652
<v Marwan Altaie>So suppose you need to look at every case
at once that has a live whip balance</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/265-2
00:59:08.652 --> 00:59:10.337
<v Marwan Altaie>every single field.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/266-0
00:59:10.577 --> 00:59:13.819
<v Marwan Altaie>That is in our significant report,
but yeah that we put into ServiceNow,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/266-1
00:59:13.819 --> 00:59:17.150
<v Marwan Altaie>we can do that. Can we? Yeah. Yeah.
Exactly. Yeah. So if you imagine them,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/266-2
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:19.016
<v Marwan Altaie>like,
the columns that you've got in your</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/266-3
00:59:19.016 --> 00:59:21.991
<v Marwan Altaie>spreadsheet today, yeah, that's a field.
So as you populate those,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/266-4
00:59:21.991 --> 00:59:24.790
<v Marwan Altaie>you can then start to create the reports
off the back of that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/266-5
00:59:24.790 --> 00:59:27.188
<v Marwan Altaie>And you might say show me the total value
or show me.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/266-6
00:59:27.188 --> 00:59:29.897
<v Marwan Altaie>Those are over a certain amount.
Show me those that are due.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/267-0
00:59:30.337 --> 00:59:33.180
<v Marwan Altaie>To get the overview,
because that's what we kind of,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/267-1
00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:37.042
<v Marwan Altaie>that's what our management board are
asking for to they want to see the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/267-2
00:59:37.042 --> 00:59:40.153
<v Marwan Altaie>overview of it.
We want to be looking at a practise level</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/267-3
00:59:40.153 --> 00:59:43.908
<v Marwan Altaie>and a division level. Yeah.
And I think that to me sits in EDPI don't</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/267-4
00:59:43.908 --> 00:59:47.770
<v Marwan Altaie>think that sits in ServiceNow,
that ServiceNow is not where we're going</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/267-5
00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:49.057
<v Marwan Altaie>to do finance reporting.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/268-0
00:59:49.577 --> 00:59:52.156
<v Marwan Altaie>You know,
so I think we just need to be very clear</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/268-1
00:59:52.156 --> 00:59:55.292
<v Marwan Altaie>about what we're actually trying to
design into service. Now.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/268-2
00:59:55.292 --> 00:59:59.489
<v Marwan Altaie>We're not designing finance reporting on
the status of an outstanding bill because</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/268-3
00:59:59.489 --> 01:00:03.231
<v Marwan Altaie>we know there's some sensitivity around
that and we don't want to open up</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/268-4
01:00:03.231 --> 01:00:06.417
<v Marwan Altaie>ServiceNow to have to go through loads of
security clearances.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/269-0
01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:09.239
<v Marwan Altaie>So I think again,
once we get this is all about the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/269-1
01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:13.280
<v Marwan Altaie>handoffs between the different functions,
the ones that are in scope for ServiceNow</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/269-2
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.685
<v Marwan Altaie>in phase one.
And we make sure we get that intent</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/269-3
01:00:15.685 --> 01:00:18.475
<v Marwan Altaie>process to make sure they're as efficient
as they can be.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/269-4
01:00:18.475 --> 01:00:22.372
<v Marwan Altaie>But we're not planning to pull finance
data in the ServiceNow to do any level of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/269-5
01:00:22.372 --> 01:00:24.777
<v Marwan Altaie>report.
Just trying to think how the how to best.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/270-0
01:00:26.137 --> 01:00:30.184
<v Marwan Altaie>If the teams are coming into here as well
as then supporting the other functions as</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/270-1
01:00:30.184 --> 01:00:33.364
<v Marwan Altaie>part of their processes,
there is a need to kind of hand off into</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/270-2
01:00:33.364 --> 01:00:37.219
<v Marwan Altaie>the whip team so they can be in service
now. There's probably not as many hats.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/270-3
01:00:37.219 --> 01:00:40.977
<v Marwan Altaie>The handoffs are probably a lot less
relevant in the whip team than they are.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/271-0
01:00:41.177 --> 01:00:43.651
<v Marwan Altaie>With quick control and other finance
teams,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/271-1
01:00:43.651 --> 01:00:48.094
<v Marwan Altaie>there's is is probably more a kind of
information sharing exercise rather than</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/271-2
01:00:48.094 --> 01:00:51.186
<v Marwan Altaie>giving a task.
If you don't have been so they might be</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/271-3
01:00:51.186 --> 01:00:54.841
<v Marwan Altaie>you know if Kirsty knows a matter is
going to build it's £1,000,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/271-4
01:00:54.841 --> 01:00:56.697
<v Marwan Altaie>000 it's going to build tomorrow.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/272-0
01:00:57.217 --> 01:01:00.949
<v Marwan Altaie>She'll probably drop Stephen a message
just like Stephen's got a bill to collect.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/272-1
01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:03.498
<v Marwan Altaie>Right. You got 1,000,000 LB coming in.
That's probably.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/272-2
01:01:03.498 --> 01:01:06.456
<v Marwan Altaie>That's probably the extent of the
handoffs. To a certain extent.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/272-3
01:01:06.456 --> 01:01:09.324
<v Marwan Altaie>And we do that via spreadsheets just now.
You don't wear that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/272-4
01:01:09.324 --> 01:01:12.737
<v Marwan Altaie>All those teams have access to.
Is that how you do that? Just now, Kirsty.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/273-0
01:01:13.577 --> 01:01:16.740
<v Marwan Altaie>Or do you drop them an e-mail?
Just drop them a message? Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/273-1
01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:20.104
<v Marwan Altaie>it's very in the office.
It's happened a lot. It's just, you know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/273-2
01:01:20.104 --> 01:01:23.167
<v Marwan Altaie>if we know our partners,
maybe we had one this morning where</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/273-3
01:01:23.167 --> 01:01:26.882
<v Marwan Altaie>partners gone out of office for a month
and we can't get any information.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/273-4
01:01:26.882 --> 01:01:30.999
<v Marwan Altaie>So that was shared between Australian and
Australian credit control team just for</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/273-5
01:01:30.999 --> 01:01:32.857
<v Marwan Altaie>reference, by the way, partner X has.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/274-0
01:01:33.297 --> 01:01:36.737
<v Marwan Altaie>Got on holiday for a month and not done
anything. Are you aware?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/275-0
01:01:38.617 --> 01:01:41.172
<v Marwan Altaie>If we want to go for a more even more
simple solution,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/275-1
01:01:41.172 --> 01:01:44.563
<v Marwan Altaie>so I stayed away from moving the
spreadsheets in purely because if there</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/275-2
01:01:44.563 --> 01:01:47.211
<v Marwan Altaie>are integrations, the future,
there's upgrades going on.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/275-3
01:01:47.211 --> 01:01:49.626
<v Marwan Altaie>I didn't think and obviously you guys can
chime in,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/275-4
01:01:49.626 --> 01:01:53.110
<v Marwan Altaie>this wasn't worth going through that
change management process making them</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/275-5
01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:55.897
<v Marwan Altaie>change all the processes,
switching across into ServiceNow.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/276-0
01:01:56.297 --> 01:01:58.735
<v Marwan Altaie>And then six months down the line saying,
well,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/276-1
01:01:58.735 --> 01:02:02.340
<v Marwan Altaie>now we're doing this like I'm assuming
that wouldn't go down the best,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/276-2
01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:06.555
<v Marwan Altaie>especially with your senior stakeholders.
I think it is a good point of digitising</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/276-3
01:02:06.555 --> 01:02:09.551
<v Marwan Altaie>the spreadsheets,
but I think there was the caveat of your</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/276-4
01:02:09.551 --> 01:02:13.411
<v Marwan Altaie>making them change their processes,
which you've just standardised and just</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/276-5
01:02:13.411 --> 01:02:13.817
<v Marwan Altaie>defined.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/277-0
01:02:14.857 --> 01:02:17.218
<v Marwan Altaie>So we can take that away as a parking lot
item.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/277-1
01:02:17.218 --> 01:02:19.579
<v Marwan Altaie>But I think it's a use case in the
parking lot.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/277-2
01:02:19.579 --> 01:02:23.662
<v Marwan Altaie>But for us to have a look at and see how
beneficial or how complicated including a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/277-3
01:02:23.662 --> 01:02:27.794
<v Marwan Altaie>security perspective of what I mean, yeah,
I think my concern is the doubling up of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/277-4
01:02:27.794 --> 01:02:31.238
<v Marwan Altaie>activity. I think that's fine.
I think that's the biggest two points.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/277-5
01:02:31.238 --> 01:02:33.697
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm certainly not against Susie and I
think it's.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/278-0
01:02:33.777 --> 01:02:36.502
<v Marwan Altaie>I've got that I can see the practical
side of it, you know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/278-1
01:02:36.502 --> 01:02:39.408
<v Marwan Altaie>being able to record everything,
have an audit trail, you know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/278-2
01:02:39.408 --> 01:02:42.587
<v Marwan Altaie>not having such a pretty mailbox.
Now being able to e-mail for it and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/278-3
01:02:42.587 --> 01:02:44.767
<v Marwan Altaie>setting the due dates is actually a nice
touch.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/278-4
01:02:44.767 --> 01:02:47.083
<v Marwan Altaie>I think I can definitely see the benefits
of that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/278-5
01:02:47.083 --> 01:02:49.217
<v Marwan Altaie>My worries I said is the the fact that we
are.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/279-0
01:02:49.737 --> 01:02:53.533
<v Marwan Altaie>At the moment we're we're sending out
emails manually and put the information</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/279-1
01:02:53.533 --> 01:02:55.674
<v Marwan Altaie>spreadsheet we're going to keep doing
that,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/279-2
01:02:55.674 --> 01:02:59.616
<v Marwan Altaie>but then we're also entering information
in here as well and it feels like we're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/279-3
01:02:59.616 --> 01:03:02.147
<v Marwan Altaie>adding an extra task to something that
we're doing,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/279-4
01:03:02.147 --> 01:03:04.677
<v Marwan Altaie>but it probably comes with the benefit of
doing so.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/279-5
01:03:04.677 --> 01:03:08.522
<v Marwan Altaie>Now that's the benefit of adding in due
dates and being able to track all that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/279-6
01:03:08.522 --> 01:03:09.057
<v Marwan Altaie>counteract.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/280-0
01:03:09.657 --> 01:03:13.794
<v Marwan Altaie>The potential more activity I don't
really know, to be honest with you,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/280-1
01:03:13.794 --> 01:03:17.931
<v Marwan Altaie>it's very difficult to quantify.
You know it's without I think it would</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/280-2
01:03:17.931 --> 01:03:21.895
<v Marwan Altaie>probably be useful to share.
Obviously the spreadsheets that you are</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/280-3
01:03:21.895 --> 01:03:24.480
<v Marwan Altaie>working from without data,
just the headers,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/280-4
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.215
<v Marwan Altaie>just the take the data out,
just the headers and stuff like that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/280-5
01:03:28.215 --> 01:03:28.617
<v Marwan Altaie>really.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/281-0
01:03:29.937 --> 01:03:33.314
<v Marwan Altaie>And then actually,
maybe it's about sharing your mailbox and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/281-1
01:03:33.314 --> 01:03:37.189
<v Marwan Altaie>given a flavour of what kind of emails or
who you're sending them to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/281-2
01:03:37.189 --> 01:03:40.843
<v Marwan Altaie>All that sort of stuff.
So it's maybe just another session we can</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/281-3
01:03:40.843 --> 01:03:44.497
<v Marwan Altaie>do actually with Kirsty and sit down and
go through some of that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/282-0
01:03:45.337 --> 01:03:48.361
<v Marwan Altaie>And then understand where's the balance?
Is it worth it?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/282-1
01:03:48.361 --> 01:03:52.445
<v Marwan Altaie>Let's go back to that end to end process
of where's the handoffs between the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/282-2
01:03:52.445 --> 01:03:55.469
<v Marwan Altaie>different teams?
Was the volume of the handoffs at those</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/282-3
01:03:55.469 --> 01:03:58.440
<v Marwan Altaie>different teams?
So as you can prioritise the different</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/282-4
01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.137
<v Marwan Altaie>workflows and where they sit in.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/283-0
01:04:01.257 --> 01:04:05.046
<v Marwan Altaie>The answer is probably not.
A lot of handoffs between Team and others</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/283-1
01:04:05.046 --> 01:04:09.431
<v Marwan Altaie>create control absolutely. There's loads,
but we're probably less so it's you're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/283-2
01:04:09.431 --> 01:04:13.058
<v Marwan Altaie>not handing off tasks so much.
You're more maybe just sharing your</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/283-3
01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:16.631
<v Marwan Altaie>snippet of useful information.
Julian just coming back to the the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/283-4
01:04:16.631 --> 01:04:18.417
<v Marwan Altaie>digitization of this spreadsheet.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/284-0
01:04:19.657 --> 01:04:23.134
<v Marwan Altaie>Chris mentioned earlier,
there's fifty people that go into it and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/284-1
01:04:23.134 --> 01:04:23.977
<v Marwan Altaie>do they edit it?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/286-0
01:04:25.337 --> 01:04:29.125
<v Marwan Altaie>They're not supposed to know the five
whip analysts are supposed to edit it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/286-1
01:04:29.125 --> 01:04:31.978
<v Marwan Altaie>no one else's. OK,
so that's why I say that EDP should be</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/286-2
01:04:31.978 --> 01:04:34.880
<v Marwan Altaie>the source to to do that sort of thing.
For those over 50.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/286-3
01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:38.520
<v Marwan Altaie>But for people actioning it and doing
something and driving as a process,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/286-4
01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.226
<v Marwan Altaie>that does make sense for that. Yeah, yeah,
that works.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/286-5
01:04:41.226 --> 01:04:44.177
<v Marwan Altaie>But I'm thinking if there's people
editing the spreadsheet.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/287-0
01:04:44.657 --> 01:04:47.433
<v Marwan Altaie>Which we're extracting twice a day.
They shouldn't. They shouldn't.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/287-1
01:04:47.433 --> 01:04:49.638
<v Marwan Altaie>They should not,
and that should be a relatively easy</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/287-2
01:04:49.638 --> 01:04:52.537
<v Marwan Altaie>thing to walk it down to a list of.
Here's the people who can view it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/287-3
01:04:52.537 --> 01:04:54.456
<v Marwan Altaie>Here's the people who can edit it. Yeah,
that,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/287-4
01:04:54.456 --> 01:04:56.743
<v Marwan Altaie>that should just be a it should be as
simple as didn't.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/287-5
01:04:56.743 --> 01:04:58.743
<v Marwan Altaie>You said these are the people who can
change it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/287-6
01:04:58.743 --> 01:05:00.417
<v Marwan Altaie>These are the people who can view it and.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/288-0
01:05:00.737 --> 01:05:04.010
<v Marwan Altaie>We just basically, you know,
he's a ticket in gaol with me.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/288-1
01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:06.792
<v Marwan Altaie>That's your lot of security.
Stuff's put in place.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/288-2
01:05:06.792 --> 01:05:09.246
<v Marwan Altaie>I do think it needs to be on EDP's road
map,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/288-3
01:05:09.246 --> 01:05:13.446
<v Marwan Altaie>but again EDP is still in an evolution
and it's probably you know you're not</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/288-4
01:05:13.446 --> 01:05:17.864
<v Marwan Altaie>looking at 2026 probably to to get that.
But the key thing is we suffice it as a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/288-5
01:05:17.864 --> 01:05:20.537
<v Marwan Altaie>use case,
it needs to be analysed and delivered.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/289-0
01:05:21.537 --> 01:05:24.895
<v Marwan Altaie>I think it's very interesting when you
when you throw in integrations to the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/289-1
01:05:24.895 --> 01:05:27.555
<v Marwan Altaie>mixed in your eyes appreciate this not in
scope of the land,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/289-2
01:05:27.555 --> 01:05:30.172
<v Marwan Altaie>but just something to think about
probably for longer term.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/289-3
01:05:30.172 --> 01:05:33.486
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm looking at doing the job. Yeah,
I mean the whole ecosystem of the three</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/289-4
01:05:33.486 --> 01:05:36.539
<v Marwan Altaie>upgrades, the new data platforms,
all of these things provide massive</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/289-5
01:05:36.539 --> 01:05:39.897
<v Marwan Altaie>opportunity, but everybody, every meeting,
every conversation I'm sure it's.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/290-0
01:05:41.337 --> 01:05:44.159
<v Marwan Altaie>It's a repeat for each one,
but definitely I just think of the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/290-1
01:05:44.159 --> 01:05:46.847
<v Marwan Altaie>overall use case.
You know the benefits that bring up quite</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/290-2
01:05:46.847 --> 01:05:50.027
<v Marwan Altaie>a lot. But yeah, I guess for now,
I think that's why it's worth having</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/290-3
01:05:50.027 --> 01:05:52.938
<v Marwan Altaie>these conversations, right?
Because we get the list of what that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/290-4
01:05:52.938 --> 01:05:56.029
<v Marwan Altaie>looks like in the future.
And then as those other projects progress,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/290-5
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:59.657
<v Marwan Altaie>we start to see where we can join that up
and stuff. So it's worth surfacing it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/291-0
01:06:00.417 --> 01:06:03.754
<v Marwan Altaie>What happened? Just no, I know.
You're absolutely. Yeah. Cool. So do we.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/291-1
01:06:03.754 --> 01:06:06.863
<v Marwan Altaie>So we'll provide you with the headers of
the report so you can see,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/291-2
01:06:06.863 --> 01:06:09.057
<v Marwan Altaie>see what's kind of information we've got.
Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/292-0
01:06:11.617 --> 01:06:15.304
<v Marwan Altaie>I think if we had the the spreadsheet,
you know another my spreadsheet,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/292-1
01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:18.530
<v Marwan Altaie>a process map as well,
just to understand your process kind of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/292-2
01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:22.626
<v Marwan Altaie>step by step and then some of the emails
just example emails that in that inbox</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/292-3
01:06:22.626 --> 01:06:26.518
<v Marwan Altaie>then it gives the kind of holistic view
of actually this how the Crypt team</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/292-4
01:06:26.518 --> 01:06:27.337
<v Marwan Altaie>operates is the.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/293-0
01:06:28.697 --> 01:06:31.754
<v Marwan Altaie>Ways that we have to kind of support
having these ways of working in terms of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/293-1
01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:34.929
<v Marwan Altaie>the tooling and then we can kind of work
out actually what are the use cases for</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/293-2
01:06:34.929 --> 01:06:37.046
<v Marwan Altaie>ServiceNow,
how does it make sense to digitise at the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/293-3
01:06:37.046 --> 01:06:39.398
<v Marwan Altaie>right point as well?
It might be right now is not the right</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/293-4
01:06:39.398 --> 01:06:42.220
<v Marwan Altaie>point without adding lots of admin
because we all want to slow you down</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/293-5
01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.297
<v Marwan Altaie>given that it's only 5 individuals in the
team that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/294-0
01:06:45.177 --> 01:06:47.979
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, supports globally and giving us WIP.
You know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/294-1
01:06:47.979 --> 01:06:50.991
<v Marwan Altaie>we don't want to kind of just stop that
process as well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/294-2
01:06:50.991 --> 01:06:54.903
<v Marwan Altaie>So we'll take away and have a look at
what what makes sense by now. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/294-3
01:06:54.903 --> 01:06:55.537
<v Marwan Altaie>sounds good.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/295-0
01:06:58.817 --> 01:07:01.903
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry, I was just going to add to that,
it might be helpful Kirsty,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/295-1
01:07:01.903 --> 01:07:04.082
<v Marwan Altaie>if you can just give us a bit of advice
around,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/295-2
01:07:04.082 --> 01:07:06.851
<v Marwan Altaie>not necessarily where you're handing off
to other ask teams,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/295-3
01:07:06.851 --> 01:07:10.572
<v Marwan Altaie>but where you're giving them information
or a flavour of what types of things you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/295-4
01:07:10.572 --> 01:07:14.249
<v Marwan Altaie>would maybe tell them what teams it would
be that you would have a communication</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/295-5
01:07:14.249 --> 01:07:17.017
<v Marwan Altaie>with them around and then we can look at
that as well, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/296-0
01:07:20.497 --> 01:07:24.383
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't think there's a need to go
through all the different slides now,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/296-1
01:07:24.383 --> 01:07:26.884
<v Marwan Altaie>but I think that was a good discussion.
Again,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/296-2
01:07:26.884 --> 01:07:31.195
<v Marwan Altaie>not to solutionize or push this down your
throat. But we also have a web scrape.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/296-3
01:07:31.195 --> 01:07:35.666
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry e-mail scraping solution that we're
potentially doing for expenses that might</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/296-4
01:07:35.666 --> 01:07:38.540
<v Marwan Altaie>be beneficial.
So instead of having to manually raise</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/296-5
01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.137
<v Marwan Altaie>this, it limits the amount of.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/297-0
01:07:40.257 --> 01:07:44.357
<v Marwan Altaie>Of information we can gather,
but it just takes your e-mail subject and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/297-1
01:07:44.357 --> 01:07:48.970
<v Marwan Altaie>your e-mail body description creates a
ticket and then tracks everything on that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/297-2
01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:51.817
<v Marwan Altaie>ticket.
That might be beneficial but just want to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/297-3
01:07:51.817 --> 01:07:56.088
<v Marwan Altaie>think about sorry, say that again.
What was it? So in a really simple way,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/297-4
01:07:56.088 --> 01:08:00.017
<v Marwan Altaie>e-mail comes in you CCNA e-mail you've
configured within the system.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/298-0
01:08:00.097 --> 01:08:02.992
<v Marwan Altaie>So ash host@gmail.
com or whip at ashashhost.com,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/298-1
01:08:02.992 --> 01:08:05.656
<v Marwan Altaie>it takes that e-mail,
takes the entire chain,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/298-2
01:08:05.656 --> 01:08:09.999
<v Marwan Altaie>puts it into a ServiceNow ticket,
and then you have it there saying if you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/298-3
01:08:09.999 --> 01:08:13.589
<v Marwan Altaie>wanted to track a specific item or if you
have, I don't know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/298-4
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:16.137
<v Marwan Altaie>a decision being made and you just want
to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/299-0
01:08:16.737 --> 01:08:20.587
<v Marwan Altaie>Have that available for reference. Yeah,
it just takes it and dumps it as a ticket</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/299-1
01:08:20.587 --> 01:08:21.097
<v Marwan Altaie>like, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/300-0
01:08:23.457 --> 01:08:27.174
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool. So we'll ignore that.
We've discussed the solutions we've</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/300-1
01:08:27.174 --> 01:08:30.078
<v Marwan Altaie>discussed,
if it's worth including and this one I</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/300-2
01:08:30.078 --> 01:08:34.608
<v Marwan Altaie>think might make a couple people panic
because we don't have integrations and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/300-3
01:08:34.608 --> 01:08:37.977
<v Marwan Altaie>we're discussing them and might make some
people excited.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/301-0
01:08:39.577 --> 01:08:43.335
<v Marwan Altaie>So this is just a high level list and
this this is an open discussion.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/301-1
01:08:43.335 --> 01:08:47.570
<v Marwan Altaie>So if anyone thinks of more benefits,
this is what I think are the big benefits</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/301-2
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:50.322
<v Marwan Altaie>of integrations.
I'll go through them step by step,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/301-3
01:08:50.322 --> 01:08:54.027
<v Marwan Altaie>but ultimately it's just understanding
what's a priority to you guys.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/301-4
01:08:54.027 --> 01:08:58.262
<v Marwan Altaie>If we do get to this stage or if there's
anything I've missed out that's a high</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/301-5
01:08:58.262 --> 01:08:58.897
<v Marwan Altaie>priority to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/302-0
01:08:59.777 --> 01:09:02.929
<v Marwan Altaie>And so first one is auto creates task
from data.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/302-1
01:09:02.929 --> 01:09:08.011
<v Marwan Altaie>So in theory if data is coming in we can
just yeah straight away that's that's</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/302-2
01:09:08.011 --> 01:09:13.093
<v Marwan Altaie>your real benefit that's your you have
all the weapon data you pull completion</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/302-3
01:09:13.093 --> 01:09:17.017
<v Marwan Altaie>dates you pull estimated billing values
against whip values.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/303-0
01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:23.215
<v Marwan Altaie>Against what's in the system and suddenly
your WIP analyst will get notification to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/303-1
01:09:23.215 --> 01:09:26.084
<v Marwan Altaie>say completion date is set for November
25.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/303-2
01:09:26.084 --> 01:09:31.170
<v Marwan Altaie>Your estimated billing value is $1
million. You're already at, you know, 900,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/303-3
01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:33.257
<v Marwan Altaie>000. You've got three days left.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/304-0
01:09:33.537 --> 01:09:35.580
<v Marwan Altaie>There's your reminder, Kirsty.
Time to step up.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/304-1
01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:38.304
<v Marwan Altaie>Go and speak to the field and make sure
they're going to build.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/304-2
01:09:38.304 --> 01:09:40.986
<v Marwan Altaie>And that's what you want.
You want your your triggers based on</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/304-3
01:09:40.986 --> 01:09:44.050
<v Marwan Altaie>database. So that's what. Yeah.
In the integration world, that's where.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/304-4
01:09:44.050 --> 01:09:46.646
<v Marwan Altaie>That's where you get your benefits of
this. Absolutely cool.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/304-5
01:09:46.646 --> 01:09:48.817
<v Marwan Altaie>So that's I'll put that high priority.
Absolutely.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/305-0
01:09:50.097 --> 01:09:54.085
<v Marwan Altaie>Show key facts inside the task.
So this is kind of a continuation from</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/305-1
01:09:54.085 --> 01:09:58.858
<v Marwan Altaie>the top one. You can start screen shaking.
You can start pulling out specific pieces</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/305-2
01:09:58.858 --> 01:10:02.284
<v Marwan Altaie>of data and you can create your reports
and your dashboards,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/305-3
01:10:02.284 --> 01:10:06.047
<v Marwan Altaie>but based on the top one,
I'm assuming that's also a high priority</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/305-4
01:10:06.047 --> 01:10:09.697
<v Marwan Altaie>and then you can evidence and quantify if
you need more support.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/306-0
01:10:09.897 --> 01:10:14.105
<v Marwan Altaie>Where the gaps are where the risks are,
where bottlenecks are timing elements.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/306-1
01:10:14.105 --> 01:10:18.472
<v Marwan Altaie>So I'll put that as also high priority.
Yeah. Can we just go back to the top one?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/306-2
01:10:18.472 --> 01:10:22.467
<v Marwan Altaie>So you're saying about the fact that
there would be quite a long lead time</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/306-3
01:10:22.467 --> 01:10:26.302
<v Marwan Altaie>sometimes to those billing things,
so so you wouldn't want to raise the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/306-4
01:10:26.302 --> 01:10:29.657
<v Marwan Altaie>ticket well long due date on it,
you would want to wait until.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/307-0
01:10:29.737 --> 01:10:34.173
<v Marwan Altaie>Due date was almost due and then raise it,
so you'd probably have to so it's so it's</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/307-1
01:10:34.173 --> 01:10:37.044
<v Marwan Altaie>not a case of, you know,
raise it with that long tail.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/307-2
01:10:37.044 --> 01:10:40.228
<v Marwan Altaie>It'd just be here,
something actionable within three to five</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/307-3
01:10:40.228 --> 01:10:44.508
<v Marwan Altaie>days, whatever the sort of agreed. Yeah,
SL ES and stuff are exactly right. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/307-4
01:10:44.508 --> 01:10:47.378
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. So you'd be.
You'd be spacing your workload on a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/307-5
01:10:47.378 --> 01:10:49.257
<v Marwan Altaie>certain point. So you don't want to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/308-0
01:10:49.417 --> 01:10:49.817
<v Marwan Altaie>That point.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/309-0
01:10:49.857 --> 01:10:53.063
<v Marwan Altaie>And you passed that deadline,
but you it's going to build next month.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/309-1
01:10:53.063 --> 01:10:55.764
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, we've got what,
three or four days for five days left.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/309-2
01:10:55.764 --> 01:10:58.375
<v Marwan Altaie>This reminder.
Now this seems to be action by the end of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/309-3
01:10:58.375 --> 01:11:02.084
<v Marwan Altaie>the week to make sure the part was lined
up to build up the first name or 3rd of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/309-4
01:11:02.084 --> 01:11:04.648
<v Marwan Altaie>November. And again, is that an EC thing?
Is that well,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/309-5
01:11:04.648 --> 01:11:08.358
<v Marwan Altaie>it is if you're pulling data from three
because those dates are completion dates</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/309-6
01:11:08.358 --> 01:11:09.777
<v Marwan Altaie>or values. So the triggers are.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/310-0
01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:14.437
<v Marwan Altaie>The data in three in the first place.
Yeah. So I think again,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/310-1
01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:19.171
<v Marwan Altaie>this goes back to what might 3.
1 bring in terms of APIs and stuff</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/310-2
01:11:19.171 --> 01:11:22.420
<v Marwan Altaie>prioritisation. So yeah, magical thing.
Well,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/310-3
01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:26.165
<v Marwan Altaie>we don't have API in the current version
we do in 3.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/310-4
01:11:26.165 --> 01:11:29.697
<v Marwan Altaie>1 and you know I think we just need to
make sure.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/311-0
01:11:29.897 --> 01:11:33.931
<v Marwan Altaie>So we're asking the questions of the team
that are doing the upgrade to see is this</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/311-1
01:11:33.931 --> 01:11:36.572
<v Marwan Altaie>a capability,
but equally there is no point in dumping</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/311-2
01:11:36.572 --> 01:11:39.742
<v Marwan Altaie>in the service now something that's going
to bail in four months,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/311-3
01:11:39.742 --> 01:11:42.623
<v Marwan Altaie>that's just you know,
it's just going to sit in a queue and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/311-4
01:11:42.623 --> 01:11:45.312
<v Marwan Altaie>it's going to muck up all the matrix and
whatever else.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/311-5
01:11:45.312 --> 01:11:46.657
<v Marwan Altaie>So it should be agreed that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/312-0
01:11:47.737 --> 01:11:51.082
<v Marwan Altaie>From the saying to ServiceNow,
here's the things that are due to build</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/312-1
01:11:51.082 --> 01:11:54.144
<v Marwan Altaie>in the next three to five days.
So who do we need to speak to to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/312-2
01:11:54.144 --> 01:11:56.924
<v Marwan Altaie>understand that's already I'm already
talking to the team.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/312-3
01:11:56.924 --> 01:12:00.787
<v Marwan Altaie>We had a conversation with Parik and Mark
and whatever as well with some of them.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/312-4
01:12:00.787 --> 01:12:03.142
<v Marwan Altaie>So again,
a lot of the things is just making sure</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/312-5
01:12:03.142 --> 01:12:04.697
<v Marwan Altaie>all the programmes are connected.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/313-0
01:12:06.217 --> 01:12:11.309
<v Marwan Altaie>To the ADP3 upgrade it's hetra. Now.
Some of this stuff wouldn't be in,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/313-1
01:12:11.309 --> 01:12:15.057
<v Marwan Altaie>you know, day one anyway.
So it's not killing us to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/314-0
01:12:17.657 --> 01:12:20.224
<v Marwan Altaie>To make understanding what what
capability they have,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/314-1
01:12:20.224 --> 01:12:23.647
<v Marwan Altaie>particularly for the the websites, yeah.
Again, we're going to capture.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/314-2
01:12:23.647 --> 01:12:26.357
<v Marwan Altaie>We'll ask that that we'll ask that
question is that yes,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/314-3
01:12:26.357 --> 01:12:30.066
<v Marwan Altaie>as a note is that maybe if it's a no,
then we need to go and find a potential</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/314-4
01:12:30.066 --> 01:12:33.584
<v Marwan Altaie>other target for that data. Yeah,
I'm also down for the three years going</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/314-5
01:12:33.584 --> 01:12:36.864
<v Marwan Altaie>to have these kind of workflow or work
case management capabilities.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/314-6
01:12:36.864 --> 01:12:37.577
<v Marwan Altaie>It's more that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/315-0
01:12:37.657 --> 01:12:40.634
<v Marwan Altaie>Kind of system record rather than a
system of engagement and action.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/315-1
01:12:40.634 --> 01:12:43.092
<v Marwan Altaie>So as we said,
we'll take offline and have a look at the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/315-2
01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:45.594
<v Marwan Altaie>kind of integration,
but also how do we support the teams</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/315-3
01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:48.787
<v Marwan Altaie>because I do want to look at the kind of
digitization of the spreadsheet.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/315-4
01:12:48.787 --> 01:12:50.857
<v Marwan Altaie>I know it's got some finance information
there,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/315-5
01:12:50.857 --> 01:12:54.351
<v Marwan Altaie>but realistically it should be just five
team members that should have access to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/315-6
01:12:54.351 --> 01:12:57.155
<v Marwan Altaie>that service now. And again,
I'm not saying we shouldn't all I'm</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/315-7
01:12:57.155 --> 01:12:57.457
<v Marwan Altaie>saying.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/316-0
01:12:57.537 --> 01:13:01.873
<v Marwan Altaie>Saying is there will be other options for
the business that might make more sense</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/316-1
01:13:01.873 --> 01:13:04.570
<v Marwan Altaie>in terms of where they would invest that
you know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/316-2
01:13:04.570 --> 01:13:08.377
<v Marwan Altaie>given the sensitivity of some of the data
that's in scope, that's good.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/317-0
01:13:12.177 --> 01:13:15.103
<v Marwan Altaie>We're talking about the sensitivity of
data,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/317-1
01:13:15.103 --> 01:13:19.134
<v Marwan Altaie>but we're going to have to deal with that
anyway. Yeah, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/317-2
01:13:19.134 --> 01:13:24.205
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't think we can see by. Oh, well,
all of a sudden data becomes sensitive</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/317-3
01:13:24.205 --> 01:13:28.561
<v Marwan Altaie>because we're talking about ServiceNow.
Data is already sensitive.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/317-4
01:13:28.561 --> 01:13:31.617
<v Marwan Altaie>It's about who has access to who's above
wall.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/318-0
01:13:31.737 --> 01:13:38.450
<v Marwan Altaie>Behind wall, whatever we want to call it,
but the same people who would access it</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/318-1
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:45.082
<v Marwan Altaie>in service now will have the appropriate
approvals to access it in three East or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/318-2
01:13:45.082 --> 01:13:49.257
<v Marwan Altaie>in a spreadsheet. It's about education,
I think I.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/319-0
01:13:49.937 --> 01:13:53.387
<v Marwan Altaie>I agree we don't want to replicate 3 E in
service now,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/319-1
01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:56.586
<v Marwan Altaie>but equally I do want us to fully
understand that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/319-2
01:13:56.586 --> 01:14:00.350
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't think we've got a full
understanding yet of what 3.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/319-3
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:05.180
<v Marwan Altaie>1 will actually deliver for us and we
need to get that bloody quickly, Alex,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/319-4
01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:09.257
<v Marwan Altaie>because I've been asking for that for
quite a while and I'm not.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/320-0
01:14:09.337 --> 01:14:13.615
<v Marwan Altaie>Not getting it you right,
but I've been told in the past. Oh, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/320-1
01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:17.075
<v Marwan Altaie>Well, you might be able to get mates.
Not good enough,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/320-2
01:14:17.075 --> 01:14:21.605
<v Marwan Altaie>because if this can help us. Yeah.
So I'm kind of sitting on the fence,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/320-3
01:14:21.605 --> 01:14:24.499
<v Marwan Altaie>right.
I'm kind of halfway where Julian isn't</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/320-4
01:14:24.499 --> 01:14:27.267
<v Marwan Altaie>saying. Yeah, let's go for it.
But equally,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/320-5
01:14:27.267 --> 01:14:29.217
<v Marwan Altaie>I recognise what you're saying.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/321-0
01:14:29.377 --> 01:14:32.815
<v Marwan Altaie>But we need 3E to start telling us,
realistically,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/321-1
01:14:32.815 --> 01:14:38.006
<v Marwan Altaie>because it's only a few months away what
actual functionality is going to be</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/321-2
01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:41.849
<v Marwan Altaie>rolled out. Yeah,
and that's why we as opposed to you're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/321-3
01:14:41.849 --> 01:14:45.017
<v Marwan Altaie>getting 3.
1 and it might be Christmas for us.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/323-0
01:14:45.377 --> 01:14:49.316
<v Marwan Altaie>Or it might not be. Yeah. And.
And that's why we just need to get the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/323-1
01:14:49.316 --> 01:14:53.931
<v Marwan Altaie>options in front of them and get the as a
yes, as I know so that we can then say,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/323-2
01:14:53.931 --> 01:14:58.320
<v Marwan Altaie>well, if it's a no, what else, what?
What other options are there and what do</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/323-3
01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.247
<v Marwan Altaie>they look like?
And last week then they spoke about</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/323-4
01:15:01.247 --> 01:15:05.017
<v Marwan Altaie>Sunday mentioned that was some
functionality that already existed.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/324-0
01:15:05.097 --> 01:15:08.577
<v Marwan Altaie>So that we just haven't. Yeah. So again,
sandeep's going to send me details of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/324-1
01:15:08.577 --> 01:15:10.559
<v Marwan Altaie>that.
He's also going to send me so he knows</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/324-2
01:15:10.559 --> 01:15:13.378
<v Marwan Altaie>about his stuff so well,
he he knows what the functionality is,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/324-3
01:15:13.378 --> 01:15:16.770
<v Marwan Altaie>and he's asked about it previously.
I don't know why it's not there until he</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/324-4
01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:19.897
<v Marwan Altaie>tells me what the functionality is.
A kind of a conversation with the.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/325-0
01:15:21.697 --> 01:15:21.817
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/326-0
01:15:23.217 --> 01:15:25.116
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.
So I mean anything that's anything that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/326-1
01:15:25.116 --> 01:15:27.883
<v Marwan Altaie>you're aware of that three should do for
us that doesn't do today.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/326-2
01:15:27.883 --> 01:15:30.154
<v Marwan Altaie>Then to me that is something that we
should again say,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/326-3
01:15:30.154 --> 01:15:33.044
<v Marwan Altaie>why have we not switched on.
You know there may well be a good reason</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/326-4
01:15:33.044 --> 01:15:35.687
<v Marwan Altaie>why it's not switched on,
but everybody needs to understand the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/326-5
01:15:35.687 --> 01:15:38.164
<v Marwan Altaie>whys and the whip side,
but the credit control side is very</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/326-6
01:15:38.164 --> 01:15:40.311
<v Marwan Altaie>relevant.
So there are work flows of credit control</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/326-7
01:15:40.311 --> 01:15:41.137
<v Marwan Altaie>to automate choices.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/327-0
01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:44.108
<v Marwan Altaie>Then the now that we don't do it here for
some reason,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/327-1
01:15:44.108 --> 01:15:46.726
<v Marwan Altaie>it's been customised to not do it and I
don't know why,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/327-2
01:15:46.726 --> 01:15:50.466
<v Marwan Altaie>but stock 3 when they wrap it back will
have workflows that can send out chases</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/327-3
01:15:50.466 --> 01:15:53.365
<v Marwan Altaie>based on a certain timing.
You send out templates, 10 blades,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/327-4
01:15:53.365 --> 01:15:56.497
<v Marwan Altaie>you press a button that sends them all
off. It's like a mass tool.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/328-0
01:15:56.937 --> 01:15:59.091
<v Marwan Altaie>We don't use it here when it's stripped
back.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/328-1
01:15:59.091 --> 01:16:02.931
<v Marwan Altaie>My intention is that we should probably
look at it well as an option. Absolutely.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/328-2
01:16:02.931 --> 01:16:05.179
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean,
for me it's just a case of this exists.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/328-3
01:16:05.179 --> 01:16:08.129
<v Marwan Altaie>We don't use it. Why don't we use it?
And if nobody knows why?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/328-4
01:16:08.129 --> 01:16:10.470
<v Marwan Altaie>If it's just some historical thing that
somebody,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/328-5
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:12.624
<v Marwan Altaie>you know who originally went in and said,
oh,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/328-6
01:16:12.624 --> 01:16:16.417
<v Marwan Altaie>we don't want to do that and it's never
been revisited and then now is the time.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/329-0
01:16:16.657 --> 01:16:17.617
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, well, I think.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/330-0
01:16:23.657 --> 01:16:27.101
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes, that's exactly right.
The functionality came out after they</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/330-1
01:16:27.101 --> 01:16:30.385
<v Marwan Altaie>started customising it,
so they put the customizations in and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/330-2
01:16:30.385 --> 01:16:34.464
<v Marwan Altaie>then I think they realised that it
wouldn't work with the functionality that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/330-3
01:16:34.464 --> 01:16:37.113
<v Marwan Altaie>came out.
So it's just never been looked at since</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/330-4
01:16:37.113 --> 01:16:39.497
<v Marwan Altaie>until we stripped back those
customizations.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/331-0
01:16:39.817 --> 01:16:40.977
<v Marwan Altaie>You're not going to be able to use it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/332-0
01:16:43.297 --> 01:16:45.097
<v Marwan Altaie>That's a whole other conversation, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/333-0
01:16:47.177 --> 01:16:48.457
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, with Betty Adams.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/334-0
01:16:51.137 --> 01:16:53.611
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool.
So just confirming this isn't the if 3E</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/334-1
01:16:53.611 --> 01:16:57.162
<v Marwan Altaie>can accommodate for these.
These are just general very beneficial</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/334-2
01:16:57.162 --> 01:16:59.851
<v Marwan Altaie>items for WIP,
so it's not an issue if 3E doesn't</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/334-3
01:16:59.851 --> 01:17:03.186
<v Marwan Altaie>accommodate for that.
What I don't think 3 E will accommodate</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/334-4
01:17:03.186 --> 01:17:07.005
<v Marwan Altaie>for is those workflows like Julian was
saying. So regardless, we will,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/334-5
01:17:07.005 --> 01:17:10.017
<v Marwan Altaie>whether it's existing in ServiceNow,
feeding data into.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/336-0
01:17:10.377 --> 01:17:13.716
<v Marwan Altaie>Report or is 3 sitting and being the
source of feeding this data.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/336-1
01:17:13.716 --> 01:17:17.763
<v Marwan Altaie>I think the teams do need that kind of
centralised area for those work flows to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/336-2
01:17:17.763 --> 01:17:21.355
<v Marwan Altaie>make their lives easier to have that
efficient reporting to have those</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/336-3
01:17:21.355 --> 01:17:24.542
<v Marwan Altaie>automations in place.
But it'll be good to know what comes out</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/336-4
01:17:24.542 --> 01:17:26.970
<v Marwan Altaie>of 3.
1 and what we can and can't feed and what</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/336-5
01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:29.297
<v Marwan Altaie>kind of the appetite of that change piece
is.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/337-0
01:17:29.737 --> 01:17:32.724
<v Marwan Altaie>Again, it's a big change management piece,
isn't it?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/337-1
01:17:32.724 --> 01:17:36.332
<v Marwan Altaie>To get them to switch across to another
system. Cool. So, yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/337-2
01:17:36.332 --> 01:17:39.432
<v Marwan Altaie>I've put those two as high priority,
whether in three,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/337-3
01:17:39.432 --> 01:17:42.813
<v Marwan Altaie>whether in service now or whether in
System 600, who knows?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/337-4
01:17:42.813 --> 01:17:45.801
<v Marwan Altaie>Smart assignment in response to target.
So that one,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/337-5
01:17:45.801 --> 01:17:49.577
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't want to say all of them are high
priorities, but that one.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/338-0
01:17:49.657 --> 01:17:53.936
<v Marwan Altaie>Is really good for kind of automation and
efficiency to be able to just auto assign</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/338-1
01:17:53.936 --> 01:17:58.164
<v Marwan Altaie>based on information from a source system
and to kick off all those workflows kick</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/338-2
01:17:58.164 --> 01:18:00.456
<v Marwan Altaie>off.
It's you essentially end up not needing</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/338-3
01:18:00.456 --> 01:18:04.277
<v Marwan Altaie>to manage any of those by trusting your
source system, your source system,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/338-4
01:18:04.277 --> 01:18:08.097
<v Marwan Altaie>you just enter, everything comes out,
all of your chases, all your emails.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/339-0
01:18:08.457 --> 01:18:12.337
<v Marwan Altaie>All of your kind of due dates reporting
is then coming into ServiceNow and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/339-1
01:18:12.337 --> 01:18:16.578
<v Marwan Altaie>obviously that will rely on creating the
correct assignment groups and assignment</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/339-2
01:18:16.578 --> 01:18:18.958
<v Marwan Altaie>roles,
which we'll need to get at some point.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/339-3
01:18:18.958 --> 01:18:22.786
<v Marwan Altaie>But that is a really good one when it
comes to automation and efficiency.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/339-4
01:18:22.786 --> 01:18:26.614
<v Marwan Altaie>Creating that automatically, yeah,
target response time set by value or H</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/339-5
01:18:26.614 --> 01:18:28.217
<v Marwan Altaie>it's just creating those roles.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/340-0
01:18:28.257 --> 01:18:31.687
<v Marwan Altaie>Roles,
roles and workflows in the system to auto</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/340-1
01:18:31.687 --> 01:18:32.177
<v Marwan Altaie>assign.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/341-0
01:18:33.617 --> 01:18:36.168
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, hopefully that makes sense. Yeah,
it does.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/341-1
01:18:36.168 --> 01:18:39.603
<v Marwan Altaie>Like teams are all split up by division
or by practise. You know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/341-2
01:18:39.603 --> 01:18:43.143
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll probably get down to our level at
some point. If you have to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/341-3
01:18:43.143 --> 01:18:46.214
<v Marwan Altaie>But that's very, yeah.
Would that help manage escalations?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/341-4
01:18:46.214 --> 01:18:49.077
<v Marwan Altaie>So then go from, yeah,
partner business manager, yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/341-5
01:18:49.077 --> 01:18:53.137
<v Marwan Altaie>because and those those escalations will
be split up at a either potentially.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/342-0
01:18:53.417 --> 01:18:57.030
<v Marwan Altaie>Practise or division level so then you
could build that in very easily to say if</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/342-1
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:59.706
<v Marwan Altaie>it's this practise.
If it's this division it goes to so and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/342-2
01:18:59.706 --> 01:19:01.669
<v Marwan Altaie>so,
so and then you get the security aspect</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/342-3
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:05.193
<v Marwan Altaie>as well one region if you don't want to
see another region we just set that up</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/342-4
01:19:05.193 --> 01:19:08.806
<v Marwan Altaie>and then you immediately don't have any
visibility of tickets or better items or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/342-5
01:19:08.806 --> 01:19:11.750
<v Marwan Altaie>whatever you want to have that
confidentiality and visibility of.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/342-6
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:13.177
<v Marwan Altaie>So that was quite good for that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/343-0
01:19:14.297 --> 01:19:16.436
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah,
the region is probably less relevant on</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/343-1
01:19:16.436 --> 01:19:18.622
<v Marwan Altaie>the website.
I think it's more more to do with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/343-2
01:19:18.622 --> 01:19:22.342
<v Marwan Altaie>practise and division because you might
have a practise head or it's a division</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/343-3
01:19:22.342 --> 01:19:26.155
<v Marwan Altaie>to have have global views practise heads
maybe across Asia and Pacific or some of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/343-4
01:19:26.155 --> 01:19:29.457
<v Marwan Altaie>the branch of it, more of Europe,
at least Europe, whatever it may be.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/344-0
01:19:30.537 --> 01:19:33.524
<v Marwan Altaie>That sounds good.
Can we get even if it's a high level,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/344-1
01:19:33.524 --> 01:19:36.777
<v Marwan Altaie>roughly what that separation is between
division area? Well,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/344-2
01:19:36.777 --> 01:19:39.710
<v Marwan Altaie>you said region's not as important,
but your division,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/344-3
01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:43.710
<v Marwan Altaie>your business manager a little to where
we can show you, yeah, yeah, cool.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/344-4
01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:44.777
<v Marwan Altaie>Thank you very much.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/345-0
01:19:45.577 --> 01:19:48.431
<v Marwan Altaie>And record approvals and update the
finance system.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/345-1
01:19:48.431 --> 01:19:52.602
<v Marwan Altaie>So this was more of a back and forth.
So if you have an action completed in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/345-2
01:19:52.602 --> 01:19:56.773
<v Marwan Altaie>three, it goes through to ServiceNow.
Any of your approvals or workflows or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/345-3
01:19:56.773 --> 01:19:59.902
<v Marwan Altaie>completions and ServiceNow then
automatically update 3E?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/345-4
01:19:59.902 --> 01:20:04.457
<v Marwan Altaie>So we'd need APIs and we need data going
back and forward, but it just means that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/346-0
01:20:04.817 --> 01:20:08.334
<v Marwan Altaie>There's not much manual input.
You're streamlining the whole system,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/346-1
01:20:08.334 --> 01:20:12.360
<v Marwan Altaie>and you're basically giving empowering
the teams to get the process end to end</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/346-2
01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:16.386
<v Marwan Altaie>without much input or much involvement.
Of course you can put in place certain</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/346-3
01:20:16.386 --> 01:20:20.362
<v Marwan Altaie>approvals and you can put in logic or
field X needs to be completed before it</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/346-4
01:20:20.362 --> 01:20:23.063
<v Marwan Altaie>sends the data back in,
but that is your validation.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/346-5
01:20:23.063 --> 01:20:24.337
<v Marwan Altaie>You're no longer sending.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/347-0
01:20:24.417 --> 01:20:28.461
<v Marwan Altaie>Emails you're no longer sending chasers.
It's system to system and you're relying</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/347-1
01:20:28.461 --> 01:20:31.272
<v Marwan Altaie>on the teams to do whatever actions they
need out of it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/347-2
01:20:31.272 --> 01:20:35.020
<v Marwan Altaie>Come back into the system and it feeds it
end to end just to ask. Actually,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/347-3
01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.697
<v Marwan Altaie>that's a stupid question actually.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/348-0
01:20:38.137 --> 01:20:40.931
<v Marwan Altaie>The partners and peers,
they're not gonna have any access to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/348-1
01:20:40.931 --> 01:20:43.954
<v Marwan Altaie>service now or there at all.
They'll just get the notification on</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/348-2
01:20:43.954 --> 01:20:46.107
<v Marwan Altaie>e-mail.
They won't put the panel they go to or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/348-3
01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:46.977
<v Marwan Altaie>anything like that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/349-0
01:20:48.737 --> 01:20:51.304
<v Marwan Altaie>They'll have.
They'll have their employee centre.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/349-1
01:20:51.304 --> 01:20:55.102
<v Marwan Altaie>So if I'm thinking, for example,
I'm a practise head and something's been</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/349-2
01:20:55.102 --> 01:20:59.106
<v Marwan Altaie>escalated to me because Kirsty's not
getting response for whatever reason and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/349-3
01:20:59.106 --> 01:21:02.443
<v Marwan Altaie>it goes to practise head,
how do they know that something's been</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/349-4
01:21:02.443 --> 01:21:04.137
<v Marwan Altaie>escalated to them? Is it do they?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/350-0
01:21:04.737 --> 01:21:08.158
<v Marwan Altaie>Get a one on their little,
you know screen and have to pop in and go</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/350-1
01:21:08.158 --> 01:21:11.231
<v Marwan Altaie>and collect it or or what's the how do
they interact with it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/350-2
01:21:11.231 --> 01:21:14.998
<v Marwan Altaie>So do you want to no good for you?
So they'll have an employee centre where</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/350-3
01:21:14.998 --> 01:21:18.221
<v Marwan Altaie>a notification will pop up.
But what we need to be mindful of is</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/350-4
01:21:18.221 --> 01:21:20.749
<v Marwan Altaie>partners won't be sitting in ServiceNow
full time.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/350-5
01:21:20.749 --> 01:21:24.417
<v Marwan Altaie>So we need to still configure how they're
going to get that notification.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/351-0
01:21:24.897 --> 01:21:27.647
<v Marwan Altaie>But they'll do the action through their
employee centre.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/351-1
01:21:27.647 --> 01:21:31.169
<v Marwan Altaie>So whatever that notification is,
it will feed them back to the employee</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/351-2
01:21:31.169 --> 01:21:34.884
<v Marwan Altaie>centre to send the action back. Yeah.
So for example, if you have approvals,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/351-3
01:21:34.884 --> 01:21:37.730
<v Marwan Altaie>which I'm not sure you will have in any
of your processes,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/351-4
01:21:37.730 --> 01:21:41.059
<v Marwan Altaie>but you could send an approval that's get
all the information in it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/351-5
01:21:41.059 --> 01:21:43.857
<v Marwan Altaie>They're basically just checking it on and
taking it back.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/352-0
01:21:43.977 --> 01:21:47.738
<v Marwan Altaie>It comes back rather than having to send,
for example, cashiers do loads,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/352-1
01:21:47.738 --> 01:21:51.905
<v Marwan Altaie>send an e-mail with loads of attachments
and stuff like that on them that will be</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/352-2
01:21:51.905 --> 01:21:56.072
<v Marwan Altaie>in the system for the movie there. Cool.
So people will have access regardless of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/352-3
01:21:56.072 --> 01:21:59.172
<v Marwan Altaie>what you are in the business,
see some kind of notification,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/352-4
01:21:59.172 --> 01:22:00.697
<v Marwan Altaie>whatever to be confirmed. How?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/353-0
01:22:01.137 --> 01:22:05.756
<v Marwan Altaie>They will access that via a portal of
that they can access on their home screen.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/353-1
01:22:05.756 --> 01:22:10.147
<v Marwan Altaie>There's no excuses for them to respond.
There isn't anything I'd say is that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/353-2
01:22:10.147 --> 01:22:14.823
<v Marwan Altaie>they'll have a limited access to certain
things just because of the way that it's</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/353-3
01:22:14.823 --> 01:22:17.617
<v Marwan Altaie>and then the way that it's licenced as
well, so.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/354-0
01:22:18.297 --> 01:22:20.498
<v Marwan Altaie>You know, we're in the whip team.
You'll have, like,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/354-1
01:22:20.498 --> 01:22:22.575
<v Marwan Altaie>a full access to all the whip case I'm
making up.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/354-2
01:22:22.575 --> 01:22:25.606
<v Marwan Altaie>You know the whip cases and requests and
all the reports and dashboards.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/354-3
01:22:25.606 --> 01:22:28.347
<v Marwan Altaie>Someone in the business,
like the partner or PE will have limited</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/354-4
01:22:28.347 --> 01:22:31.296
<v Marwan Altaie>access but can still access,
say reports or dashboards or approvals or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/354-5
01:22:31.296 --> 01:22:33.497
<v Marwan Altaie>escalations with certain key details that
they need.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/355-0
01:22:33.697 --> 01:22:35.497
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, cool.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/356-0
01:22:37.537 --> 01:22:41.231
<v Marwan Altaie>And that's part of the wider stuff that
joy and Ruth will help us through the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/356-1
01:22:41.231 --> 01:22:44.972
<v Marwan Altaie>change management perspective around
what's going to be the best way to notify</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/356-2
01:22:44.972 --> 01:22:47.388
<v Marwan Altaie>partners.
How are we going to change the behaviour</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/356-3
01:22:47.388 --> 01:22:50.845
<v Marwan Altaie>that tastes good luck with that
everybody's face is the same when we say</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/356-4
01:22:50.845 --> 01:22:51.697
<v Marwan Altaie>that it's awesome.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/357-0
01:22:55.857 --> 01:22:59.115
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool.
And then you've got your live dashboards.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/357-1
01:22:59.115 --> 01:23:00.337
<v Marwan Altaie>That's also, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/358-0
01:23:01.857 --> 01:23:06.504
<v Marwan Altaie>Live dashboards are good on there. Yeah,
live dashboards pulling in data</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/358-1
01:23:06.504 --> 01:23:10.133
<v Marwan Altaie>automatically.
The one we can do at the moment is guided</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/358-2
01:23:10.133 --> 01:23:13.061
<v Marwan Altaie>steps.
So if we brought users and ServiceNow,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/358-3
01:23:13.061 --> 01:23:16.563
<v Marwan Altaie>we could create documentation and help
kind of cement.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/358-4
01:23:16.563 --> 01:23:21.337
<v Marwan Altaie>Those process steps give them like a
reference point or best practises or.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/359-0
01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:24.095
<v Marwan Altaie>You need to speak to or that kind of
stuff, but again,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/359-1
01:23:24.095 --> 01:23:27.733
<v Marwan Altaie>you'd have to create those documents.
You'd have to make sure it aligns with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/359-2
01:23:27.733 --> 01:23:30.567
<v Marwan Altaie>your different regions,
and if it's standardised correctly,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/359-3
01:23:30.567 --> 01:23:33.259
<v Marwan Altaie>so it's again,
there's a lot of back work before you get</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/359-4
01:23:33.259 --> 01:23:35.952
<v Marwan Altaie>to this point.
Exactly acknowledge articles pretty much.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/359-5
01:23:35.952 --> 01:23:38.219
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.
So I don't know if you have anything like</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/359-6
01:23:38.219 --> 01:23:41.337
<v Marwan Altaie>that that you have on your kind of
stakeholder side to help them.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/360-0
01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:45.143
<v Marwan Altaie>And understand what it is they do or what
the process looks like, or whatever.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/360-1
01:23:45.143 --> 01:23:48.114
<v Marwan Altaie>We've got pockets of.
Some teams have it and some teams won't.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/360-2
01:23:48.114 --> 01:23:51.463
<v Marwan Altaie>But it's but not, certainly not.
Not to the extent other teams I would</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/360-3
01:23:51.463 --> 01:23:53.727
<v Marwan Altaie>have thought,
it's probably just something that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/360-4
01:23:53.727 --> 01:23:56.698
<v Marwan Altaie>actually think about is,
is there something that you're always</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/360-5
01:23:56.698 --> 01:24:00.377
<v Marwan Altaie>educating people on so happen to tell
them certain ways to do certain things.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/361-0
01:24:00.697 --> 01:24:04.012
<v Marwan Altaie>Might be applicable. It might not.
If there are things,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/361-1
01:24:04.012 --> 01:24:07.090
<v Marwan Altaie>then start to think about how we can
document that,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/361-2
01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:09.694
<v Marwan Altaie>because we can potentially push it to
them.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/361-3
01:24:09.694 --> 01:24:13.955
<v Marwan Altaie>What we need to consider here is
obviously we wouldn't have traffic for</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/361-4
01:24:13.955 --> 01:24:18.217
<v Marwan Altaie>this team coming in and making requests.
So we need to think about how.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/362-0
01:24:18.857 --> 01:24:22.608
<v Marwan Altaie>We would show that documentation. Yeah,
that's all. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/362-1
01:24:22.608 --> 01:24:27.459
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it safe to say it's a risk that it's
kind of the knowledge is stored in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/362-2
01:24:27.459 --> 01:24:32.374
<v Marwan Altaie>specific SMEs and specific people and
there's no kind of reference point if</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/362-3
01:24:32.374 --> 01:24:35.737
<v Marwan Altaie>that person leaves or if that person gets
promoted?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/363-0
01:24:36.777 --> 01:24:36.897
<v Marwan Altaie>None.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/364-0
01:24:39.337 --> 01:24:42.574
<v Marwan Altaie>Knowledge on processes,
any knowledge in general,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/364-1
01:24:42.574 --> 01:24:47.817
<v Marwan Altaie>how they do stuff processes not so much
because they are documented somewhere or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/364-2
01:24:47.817 --> 01:24:53.189
<v Marwan Altaie>yeah, they will be in the system. Show us.
You know what someone's doing as a job.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/364-3
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:54.937
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes, it probably is a risk.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/365-0
01:24:56.137 --> 01:24:58.238
<v Marwan Altaie>But again,
that's what we copy in the the box so</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/365-1
01:24:58.238 --> 01:25:01.798
<v Marwan Altaie>everyone can see what's going on. Yeah,
but yes, it is absolutely risky one. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/365-2
01:25:01.798 --> 01:25:03.727
<v Marwan Altaie>OK,
but that potentially might help mitigate</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/365-3
01:25:03.727 --> 01:25:07.115
<v Marwan Altaie>that risk because then when you switch
people out, just something to consider.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/365-4
01:25:07.115 --> 01:25:10.460
<v Marwan Altaie>And so this slide was just to kind of
give you that visibility of what we can</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/365-5
01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:11.017
<v Marwan Altaie>and can't do.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/367-0
01:25:12.777 --> 01:25:16.739
<v Marwan Altaie>Is there any additional kind of big key
items anyone wants to raise and discuss</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/367-1
01:25:16.739 --> 01:25:20.650
<v Marwan Altaie>or has that highlighted majority of what
you would think is beneficial from an</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/367-2
01:25:20.650 --> 01:25:23.721
<v Marwan Altaie>integration standpoint?
Are there any other things that are a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/367-3
01:25:23.721 --> 01:25:26.791
<v Marwan Altaie>pain for you, Kirsty?
Thinking across the team stuff that you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/367-4
01:25:26.791 --> 01:25:29.217
<v Marwan Altaie>work on,
that's just so frustrating when you go.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/368-0
01:25:29.857 --> 01:25:35.575
<v Marwan Altaie>I wish you could just. Not really, no. OK,
that's more the information that we get.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/368-1
01:25:35.575 --> 01:25:40.748
<v Marwan Altaie>But I think that that's a separate piece
and how we go about getting better</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/368-2
01:25:40.748 --> 01:25:44.220
<v Marwan Altaie>information.
I don't think it's sort of ServiceNow</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/368-3
01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:49.257
<v Marwan Altaie>slash like system kind of thing.
It's more like a learning piece for the.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/369-0
01:25:49.337 --> 01:25:54.915
<v Marwan Altaie>Business and what our team doing,
what we're trying to achieve by getting</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/369-1
01:25:54.915 --> 01:25:58.457
<v Marwan Altaie>the information they can provide us, OK,
yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/370-0
01:26:01.697 --> 01:26:02.257
<v Marwan Altaie>Cook.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/371-0
01:26:03.097 --> 01:26:07.687
<v Parik Narain>Just one more thing from my my end right
the the other benefit which you get with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/371-1
01:26:07.687 --> 01:26:12.053
<v Parik Narain>tasking is the metrics like how long
someone spent a task some time on a task</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/371-2
01:26:12.053 --> 01:26:14.963
<v Parik Narain>or how long the request took from start
to the end.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/371-3
01:26:14.963 --> 01:26:18.826
<v Parik Narain>So you can measure and improve
performance and also also manage your</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/371-4
01:26:18.826 --> 01:26:19.777
<v Parik Narain>capacity as well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/372-0
01:26:21.057 --> 01:26:24.548
<v Parik Narain>So how having all that kind of helps,
so we can build these metrics on as well</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/372-1
01:26:24.548 --> 01:26:24.857
<v Parik Narain>on top.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/376-0
01:26:26.377 --> 01:26:31.812
<v Marwan Altaie>That was actually a question I had,
so would I be able to see like what is</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/376-1
01:26:31.812 --> 01:26:37.029
<v Marwan Altaie>that with the analysts and my team?
Like how many requests that they're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/373-0
01:26:36.857 --> 01:26:37.137
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/376-2
01:26:37.029 --> 01:26:41.376
<v Marwan Altaie>sending out? OK,
if we get that digitization piece correct,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/374-0
01:26:38.777 --> 01:26:39.177
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/376-3
01:26:41.376 --> 01:26:44.057
<v Marwan Altaie>then yes. So that is another key bit.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/375-0
01:26:43.297 --> 01:26:43.777
<v Parik Narain>That's right.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/379-0
01:26:44.937 --> 01:26:48.576
<v Marwan Altaie>If you get the queue dates,
you can say you know because the 20.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/377-0
01:26:46.257 --> 01:26:48.417
<v Parik Narain>That's fine,
that's the dashboards etcetera.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/379-1
01:26:48.576 --> 01:26:53.110
<v Marwan Altaie>What are you doing? That's easier. Yeah.
You'll also be able to track as well if</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/379-2
01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:57.643
<v Marwan Altaie>we can get that digitization piece done
so that it's no extra key and but that's</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/379-3
01:26:57.643 --> 01:27:01.842
<v Marwan Altaie>the benefit of putting your queues in
here and sending your correspondence</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/379-4
01:27:01.842 --> 01:27:03.017
<v Marwan Altaie>through here because.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/380-0
01:27:03.457 --> 01:27:07.297
<v Marwan Altaie>You can start to see as well if there's
certain partners or PES that you're going</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/380-1
01:27:07.297 --> 01:27:09.639
<v Marwan Altaie>to for information,
then they're not coming back.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/380-2
01:27:09.639 --> 01:27:13.291
<v Marwan Altaie>You start to see those trends so you can
actually have conversations that are</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/380-3
01:27:13.291 --> 01:27:16.897
<v Marwan Altaie>focused around that sort of thing and
start to change behaviour around that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/380-4
01:27:16.897 --> 01:27:19.332
<v Marwan Altaie>You can see what's sitting with each of
your teams.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/380-5
01:27:19.332 --> 01:27:22.657
<v Marwan Altaie>If there's stuff that's been sitting for
too long with them or things.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/381-0
01:27:23.177 --> 01:27:27.139
<v Marwan Altaie>That they potentially could have missed
because they're going through a mailbox</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/381-1
01:27:27.139 --> 01:27:30.457
<v Marwan Altaie>and they can't catch it.
It's all sitting there for you so you can</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/381-2
01:27:30.457 --> 01:27:32.636
<v Marwan Altaie>see it.
So that's the other benefit that we</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/381-3
01:27:32.636 --> 01:27:35.310
<v Marwan Altaie>talked about.
We need to understand the balance of if</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/381-4
01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:38.975
<v Marwan Altaie>we need to do some manual keying,
what are the benefits we get outside of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/381-5
01:27:38.975 --> 01:27:40.857
<v Marwan Altaie>doing it and how long does it take us.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/382-0
01:27:41.177 --> 01:27:43.623
<v Marwan Altaie>Because from a management perspective in
your team,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/382-1
01:27:43.623 --> 01:27:47.385
<v Marwan Altaie>it may actually be a real benefit because
you can start to see all that sort of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/382-2
01:27:47.385 --> 01:27:49.643
<v Marwan Altaie>stuff.
So you can kind of break it down at each</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/382-3
01:27:49.643 --> 01:27:53.405
<v Marwan Altaie>level then so you can look at it from
like analysts and then you can look at it</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/382-4
01:27:53.405 --> 01:27:56.697
<v Marwan Altaie>from like billing completions and like
gather that sort of data pair.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/383-0
01:27:56.977 --> 01:28:00.897
<v Marwan Altaie>Practise division.
If we can build all the right stuff in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/383-1
01:28:00.897 --> 01:28:04.412
<v Marwan Altaie>the system. Yeah,
we've got the data there as well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/383-2
01:28:04.412 --> 01:28:08.264
<v Marwan Altaie>Then it'd be very easy to do as well.
Yeah. Yeah, it is.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/383-3
01:28:08.264 --> 01:28:13.874
<v Marwan Altaie>The other thing we can track is time as
well. So we will do a wider piece on Slas.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/383-4
01:28:13.874 --> 01:28:16.577
<v Marwan Altaie>But actually Olas which are operational.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/384-0
01:28:16.657 --> 01:28:18.672
<v Marwan Altaie>There's no level agreement.
So for example,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/384-1
01:28:18.672 --> 01:28:21.100
<v Marwan Altaie>if there's certain things that we start
to build in,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/384-2
01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:24.672
<v Marwan Altaie>you can start to measure a certain amount
of time. So it takes, I don't know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/384-3
01:28:24.672 --> 01:28:28.153
<v Marwan Altaie>it should take you 24 hours to do
something that should take you three days</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/384-4
01:28:28.153 --> 01:28:30.764
<v Marwan Altaie>to do something.
We need to explore what that looks like</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/384-5
01:28:30.764 --> 01:28:33.146
<v Marwan Altaie>for this team because it's just slightly
different.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/384-6
01:28:33.146 --> 01:28:34.657
<v Marwan Altaie>But those are things that we can.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/385-0
01:28:34.977 --> 01:28:37.786
<v Marwan Altaie>Build towards.
I think it would be quite good to see</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/385-1
01:28:37.786 --> 01:28:40.330
<v Marwan Altaie>when you're doing the end to end process
thing,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/385-2
01:28:40.330 --> 01:28:43.829
<v Marwan Altaie>put an asterisk next to the one that are
your biggest challenges.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/385-3
01:28:43.829 --> 01:28:48.016
<v Marwan Altaie>Or just do A1 to fives or whatever else
because then we can sort of target and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/385-4
01:28:48.016 --> 01:28:50.719
<v Marwan Altaie>focus it.
We know from all the previous workshops,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/385-5
01:28:50.719 --> 01:28:52.097
<v Marwan Altaie>for example, that the PES.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/386-0
01:28:52.657 --> 01:28:56.499
<v Marwan Altaie>Are you know going to be factored into
the stuff that Joy's doing at OCM and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/386-1
01:28:56.499 --> 01:29:00.290
<v Marwan Altaie>there's some work to be done there?
So I think if we take that as a kind of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/386-2
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:03.882
<v Marwan Altaie>joined up from every workshop,
this has been the messaging because it's</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/386-3
01:29:03.882 --> 01:29:07.674
<v Marwan Altaie>very clear that they need to come as part
of the journey. And I think, Joe,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/386-4
01:29:07.674 --> 01:29:10.817
<v Marwan Altaie>you touched on it as well last week as
well that they need to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/387-0
01:29:11.577 --> 01:29:14.665
<v Marwan Altaie>You know, they are a consistent team.
Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/387-1
01:29:14.665 --> 01:29:19.157
<v Marwan Altaie>To say it's a challenge across all
finance teams exactly right.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/387-2
01:29:19.157 --> 01:29:22.386
<v Marwan Altaie>The challenges will be the same for
everyone.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/387-3
01:29:22.386 --> 01:29:26.457
<v Marwan Altaie>And if we start to use the system to help
us tackle that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/388-0
01:29:27.857 --> 01:29:31.423
<v Marwan Altaie>This is the perfect opportunity, right?
So that's where we start having those</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/388-1
01:29:31.423 --> 01:29:32.337
<v Marwan Altaie>conversations, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/389-0
01:29:36.377 --> 01:29:40.029
<v Marwan Altaie>Any other questions on anything we've
discussed or just curiosity about</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/389-1
01:29:40.029 --> 01:29:41.297
<v Marwan Altaie>ServiceNow functionality?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/390-0
01:29:43.537 --> 01:29:47.487
<v Marwan Altaie>No. OK, so this is the whip recap.
We will come back to you with the user</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/390-1
01:29:47.487 --> 01:29:50.210
<v Marwan Altaie>stories. What we've discussed,
what we summarised,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/390-2
01:29:50.210 --> 01:29:54.427
<v Marwan Altaie>if there's any outstanding questions,
I'm sure we're going to have a couple of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/390-3
01:29:54.427 --> 01:29:58.697
<v Marwan Altaie>follow up workshops and discussions to
review everything we've discussed today.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/391-0
01:30:00.057 --> 01:30:04.848
<v Marwan Altaie>We will also align the potential
solutions with our technical team team,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/391-1
01:30:04.848 --> 01:30:09.900
<v Marwan Altaie>see what's feasible, what's not feasible,
especially about the digitization,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/391-2
01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:14.297
<v Marwan Altaie>how much effort is required and that's
the end of the WIP section.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/392-0
01:30:15.097 --> 01:30:15.217
<v Marwan Altaie>OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/393-0
01:30:17.017 --> 01:30:21.909
<v Marwan Altaie>Can I just ask a question about timings
of activity going forward?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/393-1
01:30:21.909 --> 01:30:26.946
<v Marwan Altaie>So what's the so we provide this
documentation probably could do the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/393-2
01:30:26.946 --> 01:30:31.108
<v Marwan Altaie>reports today,
Kirstie and I need to sit down and do the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/393-3
01:30:31.108 --> 01:30:32.057
<v Marwan Altaie>touch points.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/394-0
01:30:32.297 --> 01:30:36.471
<v Marwan Altaie>We'll do that whenever we get probably
next day or so. I'm flying tomorrow,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/394-1
01:30:36.471 --> 01:30:41.084
<v Marwan Altaie>so I'll just do it before I get the play
and then what's the next step? When, when?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/394-2
01:30:41.084 --> 01:30:43.500
<v Marwan Altaie>When would we expect to hear back from
you?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/394-3
01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:47.893
<v Marwan Altaie>And I've asked him because we've got a
roadshow coming up in Australia the week</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/394-4
01:30:47.893 --> 01:30:48.497
<v Marwan Altaie>after next.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/395-0
01:30:49.217 --> 01:30:52.189
<v Marwan Altaie>And I'm out for three days and Sydney
doing that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/395-1
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:56.408
<v Marwan Altaie>So I was going to say for whip is
slightly different comparison to the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/395-2
01:30:56.408 --> 01:31:00.627
<v Marwan Altaie>other to the other workshops.
So I think if we can get the output from</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/395-3
01:31:00.627 --> 01:31:05.203
<v Marwan Altaie>you this week in terms of you know the
process, the the kind of spreadsheet,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/395-4
01:31:05.203 --> 01:31:07.937
<v Marwan Altaie>the e-mail view very even just example
stuff.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/396-0
01:31:08.577 --> 01:31:11.996
<v Marwan Altaie>I think we probably need to kind of take
away and go here are the options.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/396-1
01:31:11.996 --> 01:31:14.092
<v Marwan Altaie>Here's kind of what you could potentially
do.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/396-2
01:31:14.092 --> 01:31:17.784
<v Marwan Altaie>You either decide in a kind of semi or
integrated way where it's taking a report</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/396-3
01:31:17.784 --> 01:31:21.203
<v Marwan Altaie>or you just do really basic workflow for
the other processes where you are</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/396-4
01:31:21.203 --> 01:31:23.937
<v Marwan Altaie>involved and you might potentially stay
in the spreadsheet.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/396-5
01:31:23.937 --> 01:31:27.492
<v Marwan Altaie>We kind of need to kind of give you a
view of the options first which I think</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/396-6
01:31:27.492 --> 01:31:27.857
<v Marwan Altaie>we need.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/397-0
01:31:27.977 --> 01:31:31.306
<v Marwan Altaie>Kind of present back to you next week at
some point and then we take it forward</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/397-1
01:31:31.306 --> 01:31:34.719
<v Marwan Altaie>from there rather than there's a slight
difference in other workshops where it's,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/397-2
01:31:34.719 --> 01:31:38.256
<v Marwan Altaie>oh, we've got loads of user requirements.
We know exactly what we're going to build.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/397-3
01:31:38.256 --> 01:31:40.961
<v Marwan Altaie>It's like I think we're in a kind of
option stage at the moment,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/397-4
01:31:40.961 --> 01:31:44.249
<v Marwan Altaie>first before we kind of go further and
yeah, that's good. I think that's good.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/397-5
01:31:44.249 --> 01:31:44.457
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/398-0
01:31:45.097 --> 01:31:47.942
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, cool.
I think the other thing I'd just add to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/398-1
01:31:47.942 --> 01:31:51.388
<v Marwan Altaie>that as well is we don't have the wider
timeline for you guys.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/398-2
01:31:51.388 --> 01:31:55.162
<v Marwan Altaie>You're not currently on share well.
So we don't have to get you off.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/398-3
01:31:55.162 --> 01:31:59.429
<v Marwan Altaie>And the timelines that we're doing.
So we probably can take a little bit more</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/398-4
01:31:59.429 --> 01:32:03.258
<v Marwan Altaie>time to do that discovery piece and
understand what the right kind of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/398-5
01:32:03.258 --> 01:32:04.297
<v Marwan Altaie>solution is for it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/399-0
01:32:04.457 --> 01:32:08.042
<v Marwan Altaie>So I think it's just about you guys
getting your stuff over to Marwan and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/399-1
01:32:08.042 --> 01:32:11.094
<v Marwan Altaie>Julian and the team,
and then it's about that design piece and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/399-2
01:32:11.094 --> 01:32:13.371
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll come back after that. Cool.
That's good.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/399-3
01:32:13.371 --> 01:32:17.053
<v Marwan Altaie>We'll probably need some follow up
sessions which we'll try and work around</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/399-4
01:32:17.053 --> 01:32:19.911
<v Marwan Altaie>your roadshow and yeah,
kind of your availability as well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/399-5
01:32:19.911 --> 01:32:20.977
<v Marwan Altaie>So we'll just try and.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/400-0
01:32:21.657 --> 01:32:23.643
<v Marwan Altaie>Pull it together,
send you an initial view,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/400-1
01:32:23.643 --> 01:32:27.389
<v Marwan Altaie>and then we can catch up and just kind of
work for it a little bit in more detail,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/400-2
01:32:27.389 --> 01:32:29.600
<v Marwan Altaie>right.
Do you have any sort of like visuals so I</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/400-3
01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.992
<v Marwan Altaie>can see what it looks like?
I'm one of those people.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/400-4
01:32:31.992 --> 01:32:35.016
<v Marwan Altaie>I need to see what I actually like.
If we haven't got in the pack,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/400-5
01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:37.859
<v Marwan Altaie>we can definitely share.
We've got in a lot of the other packs</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/400-6
01:32:37.859 --> 01:32:40.657
<v Marwan Altaie>within of service now. Yeah.
There'll be some on some of the.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/401-0
01:32:40.937 --> 01:32:43.594
<v Marwan Altaie>Recording.
So I think we'll have you in this shared</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/401-1
01:32:43.594 --> 01:32:46.659
<v Marwan Altaie>space, Kirsty. Yeah,
either Mel or I can follow up with you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/401-2
01:32:46.659 --> 01:32:50.592
<v Marwan Altaie>and show you where those recording ones
are. They won't be whipped specific,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/401-3
01:32:50.592 --> 01:32:54.935
<v Marwan Altaie>but there's some demos and stuff included
in the finance free stuff that we've done.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/401-4
01:32:54.935 --> 01:32:58.255
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, cool. And again, well,
we know that you're kind of loosely</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/401-5
01:32:58.255 --> 01:32:58.817
<v Marwan Altaie>coupled to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/402-0
01:32:59.337 --> 01:33:03.080
<v Marwan Altaie>The juggernaut that is phase one,
a bit like what I do with the E we're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/402-1
01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:07.031
<v Marwan Altaie>trying to pull in all the different
aspects of who will potentially be part</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/402-2
01:33:07.031 --> 01:33:10.930
<v Marwan Altaie>of it going forward. So for example,
there's a knowledge manager coming on</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/402-3
01:33:10.930 --> 01:33:13.373
<v Marwan Altaie>board,
so we'd want them to be speaking to you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/402-4
01:33:13.373 --> 01:33:14.777
<v Marwan Altaie>about what could you do so.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/403-0
01:33:15.977 --> 01:33:18.365
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes,
we probably aren't going to come at you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/403-1
01:33:18.365 --> 01:33:20.913
<v Marwan Altaie>and say let's do this from from next
September,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/403-2
01:33:20.913 --> 01:33:25.053
<v Marwan Altaie>but it's absolutely important that we
understand where we can potentially see</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/403-3
01:33:25.053 --> 01:33:29.140
<v Marwan Altaie>an opportunity to build a process and
ServiceNow for maybe another team that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/403-4
01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:31.634
<v Marwan Altaie>you could really use, you know, so again,
yes,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/403-5
01:33:31.634 --> 01:33:35.137
<v Marwan Altaie>you could do reporting through ServiceNow.
We're building an EDP.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/404-0
01:33:35.297 --> 01:33:39.434
<v Marwan Altaie>There'll be at our mesol at some point to
see where will we do global reporting,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/404-1
01:33:39.434 --> 01:33:42.702
<v Marwan Altaie>where will we display that?
Are we going to put it on this or a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/404-2
01:33:42.702 --> 01:33:45.869
<v Marwan Altaie>corporate dashboard?
We know there's going to be a short term</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/404-3
01:33:45.869 --> 01:33:49.086
<v Marwan Altaie>link between our current Intranet site
and service news stuff.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/404-4
01:33:49.086 --> 01:33:52.559
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's just working out how all those
vain diagrams fall together.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/404-5
01:33:52.559 --> 01:33:54.857
<v Marwan Altaie>I think particularly on the reporting
piece.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/405-0
01:33:54.937 --> 01:33:57.732
<v Marwan Altaie>By the end of this week,
we'll have a better idea as well,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/405-1
01:33:57.732 --> 01:34:01.426
<v Marwan Altaie>because we've got the reporting session
on Thursday and those involved in the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/405-2
01:34:01.426 --> 01:34:03.558
<v Marwan Altaie>reporting sessions like Steve,
who's on ADP,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/405-3
01:34:03.558 --> 01:34:07.347
<v Marwan Altaie>so he will know a little bit more about
that and be able to pull that together.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/405-4
01:34:07.347 --> 01:34:11.231
<v Marwan Altaie>But that's a way that's not just for you
guys. It's a way to ask reporting piece,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/405-5
01:34:11.231 --> 01:34:11.657
<v Marwan Altaie>but yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/406-0
01:34:12.897 --> 01:34:13.217
<v Marwan Altaie>There's also.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/407-0
01:34:16.497 --> 01:34:20.058
<v Marwan Altaie>I do. Yes. Please. Yes, please. Right.
We're good. Cool.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/407-1
01:34:20.058 --> 01:34:23.619
<v Marwan Altaie>So we've managed to get that done in an
hour and a half.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/407-2
01:34:23.619 --> 01:34:28.742
<v Marwan Altaie>So I'm proposing everyone has a break now.
We'll try to magically get some treats</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/407-3
01:34:28.742 --> 01:34:32.178
<v Marwan Altaie>and snacks somehow. Is it not necessarily.
I was just.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/407-4
01:34:32.178 --> 01:34:35.177
<v Marwan Altaie>I was thinking the Sugar's the Sugar's
kind of.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/408-0
01:34:35.817 --> 01:34:40.658
<v Marwan Altaie>No, no. There's sugar in the back.
Worst case scenario, just cool.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/408-1
01:34:40.658 --> 01:34:46.293
<v Marwan Altaie>So Parikh should we reconvene in 10
minutes? Sure. So 10:50. So what for you?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/408-2
01:34:46.293 --> 01:34:49.977
<v Marwan Altaie>Parikh. You're still in there. We take 15,
Marvin.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/409-0
01:34:49.417 --> 01:34:51.777
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, yeah, I'm still here. Yeah, sure.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/410-0
01:34:51.057 --> 01:34:53.657
<v Marwan Altaie>Back at 5. Two. Yeah.
We're taking 15 park.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/412-0
01:34:55.097 --> 01:34:56.257
<v Parik Narain>Thank you. Yeah, I'll see you later.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/413-0
01:34:56.497 --> 01:34:58.057
<v Marwan Altaie>Back at 55 pass please.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/415-0
01:34:59.937 --> 01:35:00.297
<v Parik Narain>Thanks.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/621-0
01:53:38.297 --> 01:53:39.737
<v Marwan Altaie>Be good to stop.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/622-0
01:53:42.097 --> 01:53:42.257
<v Marwan Altaie>Oh.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/625-0
01:54:05.457 --> 01:54:09.817
<v Marwan Altaie>Everyone good to go?
I realised we didn't go through.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/626-0
01:54:12.897 --> 01:54:15.244
<v Marwan Altaie>We went through that.
We went through that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/626-1
01:54:15.244 --> 01:54:18.657
<v Marwan Altaie>We went through that. No, we did.
We should be fine. Ignore me.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/626-2
01:54:18.657 --> 01:54:22.924
<v Marwan Altaie>And so we're going to be doing credit
control as this processes and we're going</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/626-3
01:54:22.924 --> 01:54:27.030
<v Marwan Altaie>to be starting off until Martin can jump
off on, we're going to do bad debt,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/626-4
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:28.097
<v Marwan Altaie>write off and amend.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/627-0
01:54:28.537 --> 01:54:34.537
<v Marwan Altaie>And update client terms so the structure
and approach I've taken for this is.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/629-0
01:54:39.417 --> 01:54:43.149
<v Marwan Altaie>So the structure I took was Tim's
processes he helpfully provided to me.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/629-1
01:54:43.149 --> 01:54:45.705
<v Marwan Altaie>I reviewed.
I extracted what I think was the most</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/629-2
01:54:45.705 --> 01:54:49.385
<v Marwan Altaie>relevant information and what we could
create is kind of the ServiceNow</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/629-3
01:54:49.385 --> 01:54:52.657
<v Marwan Altaie>structure. So a lot of decision paths,
approvals, touch points.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/630-0
01:54:54.057 --> 01:54:57.155
<v Marwan Altaie>The list here might not be all relevant
to credit control,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/630-1
01:54:57.155 --> 01:54:59.518
<v Marwan Altaie>but I thought it's worth bringing up
anyway.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/630-2
01:54:59.518 --> 01:55:02.038
<v Marwan Altaie>We'll have the discussion if it's out of
scope,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/630-3
01:55:02.038 --> 01:55:05.924
<v Marwan Altaie>we can skip past it or we can have the
discussion anyway to understand if</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/630-4
01:55:05.924 --> 01:55:10.177
<v Marwan Altaie>there's any touch points. So let's start.
I need to find bad debt right off 1st.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/631-0
01:55:15.697 --> 01:55:18.567
<v Marwan Altaie>Actually,
since amend updates is the first one up,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/631-1
01:55:18.567 --> 01:55:21.943
<v Marwan Altaie>let's do that first,
so we're not going to be going through</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/631-2
01:55:21.943 --> 01:55:25.262
<v Marwan Altaie>the process maps.
It's just as a reference point for where</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/631-3
01:55:25.262 --> 01:55:29.932
<v Marwan Altaie>I brought the information from alongside
what are the documents and the bit that's</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/631-4
01:55:29.932 --> 01:55:33.421
<v Marwan Altaie>relevant to you guys.
And this is going to be the same format</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/631-5
01:55:33.421 --> 01:55:34.377
<v Marwan Altaie>for all of these.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/632-0
01:55:34.417 --> 01:55:38.217
<v Marwan Altaie>The other processes as well,
we'll go through on the left hand side is</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/632-1
01:55:38.217 --> 01:55:42.284
<v Marwan Altaie>what I've understood as the as is.
So I've extracted a couple key pieces of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/632-2
01:55:42.284 --> 01:55:46.565
<v Marwan Altaie>information I was trying to structure it
as simply as possible and on the right</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/632-3
01:55:46.565 --> 01:55:50.739
<v Marwan Altaie>I've put the list of questions that I
think we need to answer as the priority</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/632-4
01:55:50.739 --> 01:55:54.217
<v Marwan Altaie>and to drive the discussion.
But of course we can have whatever.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/633-0
01:55:54.297 --> 01:55:57.090
<v Marwan Altaie>Discussions needed around the specific
process.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/633-1
01:55:57.090 --> 01:56:01.571
<v Marwan Altaie>The answers on the right are pulled from
the as is that I think are the most</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/633-2
01:56:01.571 --> 01:56:05.179
<v Marwan Altaie>relevant, but again,
that's for you guys to either confirm or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/633-3
01:56:05.179 --> 01:56:09.660
<v Marwan Altaie>say it's not and then we will also decide
what data we need to kick off this</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/633-4
01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:12.337
<v Marwan Altaie>process.
So this is just a suggested list of.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/634-0
01:56:13.057 --> 01:56:16.456
<v Marwan Altaie>Basic data that would be useful to
potentially drive this information,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/634-1
01:56:16.456 --> 01:56:20.334
<v Marwan Altaie>but it'll be good to know from you guys
when a request comes in, how that looks,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/634-2
01:56:20.334 --> 01:56:22.488
<v Marwan Altaie>how it's structured,
what stuff is left out,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/634-3
01:56:22.488 --> 01:56:26.414
<v Marwan Altaie>if we could potentially use ServiceNow to
root and drive these decision making so</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/634-4
01:56:26.414 --> 01:56:28.137
<v Marwan Altaie>you don't have those back and forth.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/635-0
01:56:30.457 --> 01:56:35.148
<v Marwan Altaie>So let's start off the amend and update
client payment terms.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/635-1
01:56:35.148 --> 01:56:40.443
<v Marwan Altaie>So comes in request to change payment
terms. Pretty self-explanatory,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/635-2
01:56:40.443 --> 01:56:46.193
<v Marwan Altaie>the process and the handoff points that
I've identified are starts with the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/635-3
01:56:46.193 --> 01:56:47.857
<v Marwan Altaie>client CRP or partner.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/636-0
01:56:48.057 --> 01:56:50.350
<v Marwan Altaie>Of course,
the client's not gonna have access to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/636-1
01:56:50.350 --> 01:56:54.234
<v Marwan Altaie>service now, but that's what drives this.
It goes through to the credit control or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/636-2
01:56:54.234 --> 01:56:57.089
<v Marwan Altaie>working capital teams and then it goes to
the practise head.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/636-3
01:56:57.089 --> 01:57:00.458
<v Marwan Altaie>If it's an approval required for 60 plus
days. So it'd be good to know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/636-4
01:57:00.458 --> 01:57:02.657
<v Marwan Altaie>I guess that's a good starting point
actually.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/637-0
01:57:03.137 --> 01:57:07.058
<v Marwan Altaie>What are the approvals needed?
Is there just one approval in place?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/637-1
01:57:07.058 --> 01:57:11.094
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that the correct process? Yeah.
So there is one approving process.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/637-2
01:57:11.094 --> 01:57:13.804
<v Marwan Altaie>So I think it's worth adding a caveat to
this.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/637-3
01:57:13.804 --> 01:57:18.417
<v Marwan Altaie>Actually this process the as is process
that you have is our new global process</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/637-4
01:57:18.417 --> 01:57:22.223
<v Marwan Altaie>that we are implementing.
So it's currently done in a very ad hoc</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/637-5
01:57:22.223 --> 01:57:22.857
<v Marwan Altaie>way around.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/638-0
01:57:22.937 --> 01:57:25.940
<v Marwan Altaie>In the world,
so I have spoken to the regions and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/638-1
01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:30.445
<v Marwan Altaie>loosely agreed that the as is process
that you have is going to be the new</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/638-2
01:57:30.445 --> 01:57:33.328
<v Marwan Altaie>process going forward,
tried to standardise it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/638-3
01:57:33.328 --> 01:57:35.970
<v Marwan Altaie>it was done in about 5 or 6 different
ways.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/638-4
01:57:35.970 --> 01:57:40.715
<v Marwan Altaie>When I went out to the various offices.
So this is as is global standard going</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/638-5
01:57:40.715 --> 01:57:42.817
<v Marwan Altaie>forward. So when we talk about the.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/639-0
01:57:42.897 --> 01:57:48.058
<v Marwan Altaie>As is, it's the the new as is,
but that's the opposing model we're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/639-1
01:57:48.058 --> 01:57:50.137
<v Marwan Altaie>aiming for. Yeah. Yeah, so.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/640-0
01:57:53.697 --> 01:57:59.057
<v Marwan Altaie>The the nuance as well was that under 60
days were good for the what was it</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/640-1
01:57:59.057 --> 01:58:04.558
<v Marwan Altaie>practise head and practise head is that
credit control working capital review</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/640-2
01:58:04.558 --> 01:58:10.341
<v Marwan Altaie>request practise head trying to remember
that I'm sure there was another under 60</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/640-3
01:58:10.341 --> 01:58:12.457
<v Marwan Altaie>days caveat wasn't there yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/641-0
01:58:14.257 --> 01:58:19.657
<v Marwan Altaie>Up to 60. Fine. Fine.
So there there is also a double part of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/641-1
01:58:19.657 --> 01:58:23.925
<v Marwan Altaie>it as well.
So there is if you're a partner on a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/641-2
01:58:23.925 --> 01:58:27.932
<v Marwan Altaie>matter,
you can approve your payment terms on</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/641-3
01:58:27.932 --> 01:58:28.977
<v Marwan Altaie>your matter.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/642-0
01:58:29.577 --> 01:58:32.781
<v Marwan Altaie>Of up to 60 days. Oh, I'm sorry.
I do have it on the approvals.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/642-1
01:58:32.781 --> 01:58:36.685
<v Marwan Altaie>I did think I brought that planner can
approve up to 60 days on their matter.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/642-2
01:58:36.685 --> 01:58:40.089
<v Marwan Altaie>Let's see. That's meant to be.
CRP can approve up to 60 days on all</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/642-3
01:58:40.089 --> 01:58:43.442
<v Marwan Altaie>matters for their clients.
Practise head approval required over 60</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/642-4
01:58:43.442 --> 01:58:46.996
<v Marwan Altaie>days. Is that exactly right?
So a partner can approve on their matters</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/642-5
01:58:46.996 --> 01:58:47.697
<v Marwan Altaie>up to 60 days.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/643-0
01:58:48.497 --> 01:58:51.432
<v Marwan Altaie>What they can't do is change client level
payment terms,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/643-1
01:58:51.432 --> 01:58:55.344
<v Marwan Altaie>so payment terms are held at 2 levels.
They're held at a matter level and a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/643-2
01:58:55.344 --> 01:58:57.764
<v Marwan Altaie>client level.
The matters override the client.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/643-3
01:58:57.764 --> 01:59:01.059
<v Marwan Altaie>So if it's a 30 days of matter level but
60 days of the client,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/643-4
01:59:01.059 --> 01:59:04.817
<v Marwan Altaie>the 30 days will take precedent.
So matters will always override client.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/644-0
01:59:05.777 --> 01:59:10.056
<v Marwan Altaie>What we can't have is a matter level
partner coming in and saying I want to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/644-1
01:59:10.056 --> 01:59:13.715
<v Marwan Altaie>change the payment terms on my client to
be 60 days for example,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/644-2
01:59:13.715 --> 01:59:17.599
<v Marwan Altaie>and there are 20 other matters all sat
around all the other parties.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/644-3
01:59:17.599 --> 01:59:20.977
<v Marwan Altaie>So the only person that's allowed to
change a client level.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/645-0
01:59:21.457 --> 01:59:25.814
<v Marwan Altaie>Is the client relationship partner.
They can approve that so matter partner</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/645-1
01:59:25.814 --> 01:59:29.826
<v Marwan Altaie>can approve their own matter.
Client relationship partner can approve</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/645-2
01:59:29.826 --> 01:59:34.470
<v Marwan Altaie>their own. The client level part terms.
These are all up to 60 days when it gets</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/645-3
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:37.737
<v Marwan Altaie>above 60 days needs to be approved by the
practise head.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/646-0
01:59:38.337 --> 01:59:42.424
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, that's sorry, that's easy enough.
Then we can create those as roles within</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/646-1
01:59:42.424 --> 01:59:45.839
<v Marwan Altaie>ServiceNow and that's our assignment
groups essentially for this.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/646-2
01:59:45.839 --> 01:59:50.030
<v Marwan Altaie>The touch points that I've identified is
that correct all the way through and it</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/646-3
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:52.617
<v Marwan Altaie>ends with the credit control and working
capital.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/646-4
01:59:52.617 --> 01:59:56.497
<v Marwan Altaie>So working capital and credit control
ultimately make the change in three.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/647-0
01:59:58.497 --> 02:00:00.257
<v Marwan Altaie>It's changing due to I have a time to
move on.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/648-0
02:00:01.937 --> 02:00:04.149
<v Marwan Altaie>Generally,
myself or somebody in the team would do</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/648-1
02:00:04.149 --> 02:00:06.621
<v Marwan Altaie>it. Yeah, sorry.
Every it would be with the confirmation</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/648-2
02:00:06.621 --> 02:00:09.137
<v Marwan Altaie>from the Parliament. Yeah, OK.
Every would come with the.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/649-0
02:00:10.417 --> 02:00:13.991
<v Marwan Altaie>That instruction,
and again that's that's a e-mail at the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/649-1
02:00:13.991 --> 02:00:14.977
<v Marwan Altaie>moment, yes. OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/650-0
02:00:16.337 --> 02:00:19.071
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes,
that would that would be via e-mail from</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/650-1
02:00:19.071 --> 02:00:21.923
<v Marwan Altaie>the partner CRP, whoever it might be. OK,
fine.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/650-2
02:00:21.923 --> 02:00:25.548
<v Marwan Altaie>So if we stuck to this logic for
workflows, is that correct?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/650-3
02:00:25.548 --> 02:00:30.243
<v Marwan Altaie>If we set up the rules and routing based
on these touch points? Yeah. As yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/650-4
02:00:30.243 --> 02:00:34.937
<v Marwan Altaie>as Chris says, that's the the process.
Yeah. As I was moving forward. So cool.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/651-0
02:00:36.377 --> 02:00:39.154
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry,
the one thing I would say and this is I</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/651-1
02:00:39.154 --> 02:00:43.998
<v Marwan Altaie>guess where the request departs come in.
So this is goes back to our conversation</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/651-2
02:00:43.998 --> 02:00:47.897
<v Marwan Altaie>we talked earlier about the how would I
partner access something.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/652-0
02:00:49.137 --> 02:00:51.559
<v Marwan Altaie>These requests are going to come from a
partner,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/652-1
02:00:51.559 --> 02:00:55.265
<v Marwan Altaie>so are they going to send an e-mail and
then that will create a requesting</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/652-2
02:00:55.265 --> 02:00:59.268
<v Marwan Altaie>service now or will they go into a panel
that says change payment terms and then</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/652-3
02:00:59.268 --> 02:01:02.529
<v Marwan Altaie>build something and then it goes off,
they'll go into the portal.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/652-4
02:01:02.529 --> 02:01:06.631
<v Marwan Altaie>So that's part of the wider change piece
that we will be pushing people to go into</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/652-5
02:01:06.631 --> 02:01:08.657
<v Marwan Altaie>the portal rather than sending an e-mail.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/653-0
02:01:09.057 --> 02:01:11.718
<v Marwan Altaie>So we can control the information that's
coming in. Great.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/653-1
02:01:11.718 --> 02:01:15.235
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it worth at this stage since we're
still waiting for marks to go through a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/653-2
02:01:15.235 --> 02:01:17.219
<v Marwan Altaie>lot of these to show the proposed
solution,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/653-3
02:01:17.219 --> 02:01:20.826
<v Marwan Altaie>so it helps kind of understand the flow
and how we're going to be doing it from</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/653-4
02:01:20.826 --> 02:01:24.028
<v Marwan Altaie>the portal through to collecting data or
should we just continue this,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/653-5
02:01:24.028 --> 02:01:26.057
<v Marwan Altaie>let's continue this for now, are they?
Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/654-0
02:01:26.537 --> 02:01:29.900
<v Marwan Altaie>I think Martin will join if he can,
but I don't think he's due to be here</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/654-1
02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:32.491
<v Marwan Altaie>till about 1:00.
So it depends what they've got going on</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/654-2
02:01:32.491 --> 02:01:35.354
<v Marwan Altaie>in the team and stuff like that,
whether he can actually join.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/654-3
02:01:35.354 --> 02:01:39.036
<v Marwan Altaie>So I think we just go through it, Marvin,
and we'll just capture any points that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/654-4
02:01:39.036 --> 02:01:42.536
<v Marwan Altaie>are coming up for him and I'll cover that
and if we need to fall back to it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/654-5
02:01:42.536 --> 02:01:44.990
<v Marwan Altaie>we will. OK,
I'll continue with this one and then bad</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/654-6
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:46.217
<v Marwan Altaie>and then we'll circle back.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/655-0
02:01:46.297 --> 02:01:50.850
<v Marwan Altaie>To the top. If he joins, he joins. OK,
so raising I've got client and CRP</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/655-1
02:01:50.850 --> 02:01:53.988
<v Marwan Altaie>partner.
But of course within this system it would</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/655-2
02:01:53.988 --> 02:01:58.541
<v Marwan Altaie>be always saying primarily the partner is
that who's this is targeted at.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/655-3
02:01:58.541 --> 02:02:02.233
<v Marwan Altaie>It would be, yeah.
So the request generally come from part.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/655-4
02:02:02.233 --> 02:02:05.617
<v Marwan Altaie>I would say it might come from AP as well
potentially.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/656-0
02:02:07.137 --> 02:02:09.956
<v Marwan Altaie>They the partner,
may have instructed said to them.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/656-1
02:02:09.956 --> 02:02:12.937
<v Marwan Altaie>Can you please ask someone to update his
terms for me?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/657-0
02:02:14.897 --> 02:02:18.886
<v Marwan Altaie>But ultimately it should be.
AP wouldn't do it off their own back.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/657-1
02:02:18.886 --> 02:02:22.815
<v Marwan Altaie>It would come from a partner in the 1st
place. So partner raises.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/657-2
02:02:22.815 --> 02:02:27.101
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we have any delegation process?
Is is that something in scope at the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/657-3
02:02:27.101 --> 02:02:31.745
<v Marwan Altaie>moment that partner will tell someone
else to do it and then they raise it on</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/657-4
02:02:31.745 --> 02:02:32.697
<v Marwan Altaie>their behalf or?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/658-0
02:02:33.097 --> 02:02:35.110
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it always a partner and it it's as
simple as that?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/658-1
02:02:35.110 --> 02:02:36.377
<v Marwan Altaie>They're the one that's raising it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/659-0
02:02:37.857 --> 02:02:40.673
<v Marwan Altaie>So partner may ask APE to do it on their
behalf.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/659-1
02:02:40.673 --> 02:02:44.810
<v Marwan Altaie>I think that's probably more of a wider
finance behaviour we will have.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/659-2
02:02:44.810 --> 02:02:49.349
<v Marwan Altaie>I think we are building that and aren't
we on behalf of type requests that PES</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/659-3
02:02:49.349 --> 02:02:52.682
<v Marwan Altaie>and partners will kind of be
interchangeable if you like.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/659-4
02:02:52.682 --> 02:02:55.497
<v Marwan Altaie>Just wanted to make sure so I could make
a note.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/660-0
02:03:01.377 --> 02:03:02.857
<v Marwan Altaie>Hope and.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/661-0
02:03:04.217 --> 02:03:06.817
<v Marwan Altaie>Decision plots that I've identified as
just approve a decline.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/662-0
02:03:09.337 --> 02:03:13.397
<v Marwan Altaie>We would client the change to payment.
Yeah, approvals, we said practise head,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/662-1
02:03:13.397 --> 02:03:17.097
<v Marwan Altaie>that's fine. It finishes this process.
Credit control, working capital,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/662-2
02:03:17.097 --> 02:03:21.260
<v Marwan Altaie>we said that's fine evidence on closure.
I know you came back on e-mail and said</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/662-3
02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:25.217
<v Marwan Altaie>there's certain items we don't want to
have necessarily evidence because it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/663-0
02:03:25.737 --> 02:03:29.623
<v Marwan Altaie>Bottle next or blocks them a little bit.
Is that something we want to make</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/663-1
02:03:29.623 --> 02:03:33.715
<v Marwan Altaie>mandatory when they make that change that
they have to have XY and Z included,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/663-2
02:03:33.715 --> 02:03:36.357
<v Marwan Altaie>or do we just want to have simple closed
tick box?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/663-3
02:03:36.357 --> 02:03:40.450
<v Marwan Altaie>What's what's the most optimal solution
that you get your audit check box done</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/663-4
02:03:40.450 --> 02:03:40.657
<v Marwan Altaie>and?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/664-0
02:03:40.977 --> 02:03:42.257
<v Marwan Altaie>It's simple enough for the users.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/665-0
02:03:46.777 --> 02:03:50.356
<v Marwan Altaie>Just to say it's done,
you mean basically do we need screenshots</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/665-1
02:03:50.356 --> 02:03:54.101
<v Marwan Altaie>or reports or no, no, no.
The payment terms would be updated system</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/665-2
02:03:54.101 --> 02:03:58.341
<v Marwan Altaie>as long as there's a record to say so and
so has requested us to prove this.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/665-3
02:03:58.341 --> 02:04:01.865
<v Marwan Altaie>That's all we really need.
I don't think there's anything else.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/665-4
02:04:01.865 --> 02:04:03.297
<v Marwan Altaie>I can't think of anything.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/666-0
02:04:03.777 --> 02:04:06.857
<v Marwan Altaie>You currently notify them like you say.
Oh, I've updated that and.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/667-0
02:04:08.817 --> 02:04:10.961
<v Marwan Altaie>They just assume that they send it off
and it's done. Really.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/667-1
02:04:10.961 --> 02:04:12.137
<v Marwan Altaie>It's just an assumption it's done.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/668-0
02:04:15.017 --> 02:04:19.913
<v Marwan Altaie>The UK, Europe and America,
such a real request that is such a real</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/668-1
02:04:19.913 --> 02:04:25.241
<v Marwan Altaie>request that you know there's no
formalised process for it's generally we</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/668-2
02:04:25.241 --> 02:04:30.857
<v Marwan Altaie>get the request and you know we then go
back and advise the partner or the PE</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/668-3
02:04:30.857 --> 02:04:32.297
<v Marwan Altaie>that it's been done.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/669-0
02:04:33.977 --> 02:04:37.163
<v Marwan Altaie>In terms of what your your check mark
would be, has it been done or not?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/669-1
02:04:37.163 --> 02:04:39.084
<v Marwan Altaie>It would be visible to the partner,
the PE,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/669-2
02:04:39.084 --> 02:04:42.488
<v Marwan Altaie>the credit control teams on the system
you know would be able to pick up from</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/669-3
02:04:42.488 --> 02:04:45.369
<v Marwan Altaie>the metric report the part,
and the PE would be able to see it as</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/669-4
02:04:45.369 --> 02:04:47.420
<v Marwan Altaie>well.
When they look at the Monday end reports</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/669-5
02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:49.733
<v Marwan Altaie>that you know that partner debt reports
and whatnot.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/669-6
02:04:49.733 --> 02:04:51.697
<v Marwan Altaie>So you know that that would be your
cheques.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/671-0
02:04:51.897 --> 02:04:54.561
<v Marwan Altaie>Balances really. OK.
So so from a reporting perspective,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/671-1
02:04:54.561 --> 02:04:58.020
<v Marwan Altaie>a safe assumption is any data or data
points we've identified here can be</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/671-2
02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:00.872
<v Marwan Altaie>configurable in the report.
So if we have evidence required,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/671-3
02:05:00.872 --> 02:05:03.396
<v Marwan Altaie>yes or no,
it's just something that can be picked up.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/671-4
02:05:03.396 --> 02:05:06.387
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's quite easy to,
it would be visible on the report. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/671-5
02:05:06.387 --> 02:05:08.257
<v Marwan Altaie>when you look at the payment term, Jess.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/672-0
02:05:11.257 --> 02:05:14.154
<v Marwan Altaie>Check something on the decisions,
so if it's approved,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/672-1
02:05:14.154 --> 02:05:17.841
<v Marwan Altaie>it follows the happy path it goes through
and do what you need to do.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/672-2
02:05:17.841 --> 02:05:20.685
<v Marwan Altaie>If it's declined,
will they sometimes come back and I</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/672-3
02:05:20.685 --> 02:05:24.320
<v Marwan Altaie>should do something else or change
something before they approve it?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/672-4
02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:25.057
<v Marwan Altaie>Or is it just?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/673-0
02:05:25.337 --> 02:05:29.612
<v Marwan Altaie>It won't be the only reason we would
decline it is if the approval level</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/673-1
02:05:29.612 --> 02:05:33.068
<v Marwan Altaie>wasn't correct. Stephen,
I would very much like to say no,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/673-2
02:05:33.068 --> 02:05:37.109
<v Marwan Altaie>you're not having those terms.
I don't think we can unfortunately as</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/673-3
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:40.974
<v Marwan Altaie>long as the approval is there,
whatever the relevant approval is,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/673-4
02:05:40.974 --> 02:05:42.497
<v Marwan Altaie>then we need to accept it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/674-0
02:05:43.137 --> 02:05:45.575
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, so how do they send that approval?
At the moment,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/674-1
02:05:45.575 --> 02:05:48.826
<v Marwan Altaie>do they send it at the start when they
request it? Is it an attachment?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/674-2
02:05:48.826 --> 02:05:52.257
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it somebody's e-mail? Is it a partner?
Is it just a partner approving it</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/674-3
02:05:52.257 --> 02:05:54.605
<v Marwan Altaie>themselves,
or does it need to go to somewhere? No,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/674-4
02:05:54.605 --> 02:05:57.223
<v Marwan Altaie>this is the problem.
There is a lack of approval process,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/674-5
02:05:57.223 --> 02:05:59.977
<v Marwan Altaie>so some parts will approve it.
Some will just say do it and.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/675-0
02:06:00.217 --> 02:06:04.073
<v Marwan Altaie>Not ask senior approval and set terms of
120 days so the and would that be your</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/675-1
02:06:04.073 --> 02:06:06.242
<v Marwan Altaie>job to say no,
you can't do that and either,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/675-2
02:06:06.242 --> 02:06:09.953
<v Marwan Altaie>which is why you're putting in this
approval process to make sure this stops</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/675-3
02:06:09.953 --> 02:06:12.459
<v Marwan Altaie>happening.
If you want to extend extended terms for</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/675-4
02:06:12.459 --> 02:06:14.917
<v Marwan Altaie>60 days,
you can go and speak to your practise and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/675-5
02:06:14.917 --> 02:06:18.580
<v Marwan Altaie>justify why you're doing it needs to be a
good business reason to take some</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/675-6
02:06:18.580 --> 02:06:19.737
<v Marwan Altaie>ownership of it to stop.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/676-0
02:06:19.937 --> 02:06:22.757
<v Marwan Altaie>Is just making these changes.
That's the idea behind it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/676-1
02:06:22.757 --> 02:06:26.715
<v Marwan Altaie>because what we can do when they come
through the portal and the form is we can</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/676-2
02:06:26.715 --> 02:06:30.673
<v Marwan Altaie>make it mandatory that we have to attach
approval if that's something that will</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/676-3
02:06:30.673 --> 02:06:33.345
<v Marwan Altaie>work. It is.
But if it's the partner who's requesting</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/676-4
02:06:33.345 --> 02:06:36.759
<v Marwan Altaie>it, then they don't need to.
So you need to just build that into the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/676-5
02:06:36.759 --> 02:06:39.629
<v Marwan Altaie>logic. But yeah,
you'd want it as a step then as it comes</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/676-6
02:06:39.629 --> 02:06:39.777
<v Marwan Altaie>in.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/677-0
02:06:40.537 --> 02:06:40.777
<v Marwan Altaie>Umm.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/678-0
02:06:44.297 --> 02:06:46.535
<v Marwan Altaie>If you could build it into the logic,
then yes.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/678-1
02:06:46.535 --> 02:06:48.587
<v Marwan Altaie>If you could say if you want terms over
60,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/678-2
02:06:48.587 --> 02:06:51.477
<v Marwan Altaie>I assume you're going to fill in a box
saying how many, what,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/678-3
02:06:51.477 --> 02:06:53.902
<v Marwan Altaie>what terms do you want?
Anything that says 60 plus?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/678-4
02:06:53.902 --> 02:06:57.259
<v Marwan Altaie>Then you need to attach an approval of
practise. So that would be good.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/678-5
02:06:57.259 --> 02:06:58.937
<v Marwan Altaie>Maybe we could configure that right.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/679-0
02:06:59.577 --> 02:07:02.097
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, that'd be cool.
That would force the hand a bit.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/680-0
02:07:03.857 --> 02:07:06.936
<v Marwan Altaie>Just got to be conscious that if we're
saying attach an approval,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/680-1
02:07:06.936 --> 02:07:10.528
<v Marwan Altaie>it could actually just be a text document
and nothing in it and it will come</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/680-2
02:07:10.528 --> 02:07:13.654
<v Marwan Altaie>through, won't it or get submitted.
We can't look into absolutely,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/680-3
02:07:13.654 --> 02:07:16.733
<v Marwan Altaie>but that's why we that's why Stephen and
I or the other managers,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/680-4
02:07:16.733 --> 02:07:20.045
<v Marwan Altaie>when we're doing it and check it,
we do that bad debt right off style.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/680-5
02:07:20.045 --> 02:07:22.937
<v Marwan Altaie>I would always read what someone's
attached and if it wasn't.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/681-0
02:07:23.297 --> 02:07:26.222
<v Marwan Altaie>Correct. I said it back and say, oh,
you know, it's not right. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/681-1
02:07:26.222 --> 02:07:29.487
<v Marwan Altaie>I think the benefit we're doing though,
if we put that rule in is that we're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/681-2
02:07:29.487 --> 02:07:32.836
<v Marwan Altaie>putting the onus back on to the partner
to see if you don't have the approval,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/681-3
02:07:32.836 --> 02:07:36.269
<v Marwan Altaie>you need to attach it before even sending
it to us. Of course, when it comes in,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/681-4
02:07:36.269 --> 02:07:38.177
<v Marwan Altaie>you'll need to check that it's the
approval.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/682-0
02:07:39.657 --> 02:07:39.777
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/683-0
02:07:43.257 --> 02:07:45.368
<v Marwan Altaie>So yeah, the next slide,
once we get to it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/683-1
02:07:45.368 --> 02:07:48.822
<v Marwan Altaie>we can decide what's useful to have on
there as the initial submission.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/683-2
02:07:48.822 --> 02:07:52.804
<v Marwan Altaie>But I just want to finish this one first,
just to make sure I've aligned with your</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/683-3
02:07:52.804 --> 02:07:56.403
<v Marwan Altaie>expectations. So where did we get to?
So evidence of closure, don't worry,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/683-4
02:07:56.403 --> 02:07:59.617
<v Marwan Altaie>I'll change all this afterwards.
I'm just making notes for myself.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/684-0
02:08:00.577 --> 02:08:05.363
<v Marwan Altaie>So evidence on closure not required,
but it seems like evidence on submission</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/684-1
02:08:05.363 --> 02:08:08.923
<v Marwan Altaie>could be beneficial submission in terms
of notifications,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/684-2
02:08:08.923 --> 02:08:13.893
<v Marwan Altaie>we're saying there's no specific process,
it's just if someone makes that change</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/684-3
02:08:13.893 --> 02:08:16.777
<v Marwan Altaie>request and it's approved,
that assumption is.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/685-0
02:08:17.297 --> 02:08:20.094
<v Marwan Altaie>That's it. That's done. Yeah.
I don't think we need to do it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/685-1
02:08:20.094 --> 02:08:22.170
<v Marwan Altaie>I just feel like something that needed.
Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/685-2
02:08:22.170 --> 02:08:25.779
<v Marwan Altaie>we're just bombarding partners of crap.
Otherwise, I'd just get fed up. We can.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/685-3
02:08:25.779 --> 02:08:27.854
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean,
if they get fed up for notifications,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/685-4
02:08:27.854 --> 02:08:30.697
<v Marwan Altaie>we won't include this.
But we can always include auto triggers</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/685-5
02:08:30.697 --> 02:08:33.810
<v Marwan Altaie>saying e-mail notification.
This is now your ticket is now closed or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/685-6
02:08:33.810 --> 02:08:36.697
<v Marwan Altaie>this has now been complete.
Something like that. I don't think.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/686-0
02:08:36.777 --> 02:08:39.167
<v Marwan Altaie>Me to I think if we were asked for
confirmation,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/686-1
02:08:39.167 --> 02:08:42.288
<v Marwan Altaie>we could just send a manual e-mail.
But most people won't care.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/686-2
02:08:42.288 --> 02:08:45.799
<v Marwan Altaie>They're just send a request.
If I'll be done. Yeah. It's such a simple,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/686-3
02:08:45.799 --> 02:08:47.457
<v Marwan Altaie>easy request. It's probably, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/687-0
02:08:48.777 --> 02:08:50.137
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, cool. Not an issue.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/688-0
02:08:52.577 --> 02:08:53.177
<v Marwan Altaie>Thank you.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/689-0
02:08:57.617 --> 02:09:01.528
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool and specific region processes or
systems all the same.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/689-1
02:09:01.528 --> 02:09:04.396
<v Marwan Altaie>All the same amazing globally
standardised.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/689-2
02:09:04.396 --> 02:09:08.242
<v Marwan Altaie>What we'd like to hear the business
doesn't know this yet,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/689-3
02:09:08.242 --> 02:09:12.610
<v Marwan Altaie>but this and I guess this is where the
change piece might come in,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/689-4
02:09:12.610 --> 02:09:16.977
<v Marwan Altaie>because I've designed this as this
process has been signed off by.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/690-0
02:09:17.377 --> 02:09:20.404
<v Marwan Altaie>The local finance teams,
but it hasn't necessarily been</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/690-1
02:09:20.404 --> 02:09:24.025
<v Marwan Altaie>communicated out to the wider business
community. Over to you. No,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/690-2
02:09:24.025 --> 02:09:27.916
<v Marwan Altaie>I was going to ask, actually,
you were saying before that this is a new</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/690-3
02:09:27.916 --> 02:09:30.619
<v Marwan Altaie>process.
How widely has it been accepted and have</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/690-4
02:09:30.619 --> 02:09:33.537
<v Marwan Altaie>people started using this new way of
working already?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/691-0
02:09:33.857 --> 02:09:37.195
<v Marwan Altaie>Or is it still going through OK?
It was bought in because I knew we were</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/691-1
02:09:37.195 --> 02:09:39.527
<v Marwan Altaie>doing this. Yeah.
Like a very trial opportunity to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/691-2
02:09:39.527 --> 02:09:42.225
<v Marwan Altaie>standardise things.
And whilst we have a change management</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/691-3
02:09:42.225 --> 02:09:44.740
<v Marwan Altaie>team on side,
you can do all the hard work without me.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/691-4
02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:48.033
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean to be honest with you.
So it's just a great, a good opportunity,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/691-5
02:09:48.033 --> 02:09:50.594
<v Marwan Altaie>but we're looking.
I think Jill said to be a while ago,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/691-6
02:09:50.594 --> 02:09:53.017
<v Marwan Altaie>look at the processes that might lend
themselves to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/692-0
02:09:53.577 --> 02:09:56.339
<v Marwan Altaie>And thinking about it,
this is one where there was five or six</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/692-1
02:09:56.339 --> 02:09:59.408
<v Marwan Altaie>different processes going on.
It's actually such a simple process and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/692-2
02:09:59.408 --> 02:10:01.556
<v Marwan Altaie>there's no reason not to have a global
standard.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/692-3
02:10:01.556 --> 02:10:04.844
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's a very easy bit of change
management. This is not going to happen.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/692-4
02:10:04.844 --> 02:10:07.299
<v Marwan Altaie>This is the benefits,
but just a good opportunity to do</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/692-5
02:10:07.299 --> 02:10:09.272
<v Marwan Altaie>something that's just so easy and so
simple.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/692-6
02:10:09.272 --> 02:10:12.647
<v Marwan Altaie>I suppose the only question that's
outstanding is if you want them to change</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/692-7
02:10:12.647 --> 02:10:13.217
<v Marwan Altaie>before we go.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/693-0
02:10:13.337 --> 02:10:16.261
<v Marwan Altaie>Live so be in the mind.
We're not going live until September.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/693-1
02:10:16.261 --> 02:10:18.714
<v Marwan Altaie>So if you want them to move into this
global piece,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/693-2
02:10:18.714 --> 02:10:22.629
<v Marwan Altaie>that's probably something that we'll need
to sit with you guys around that change.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/693-3
02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:25.034
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. Yeah. Good point, John.
That was the answer.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/693-4
02:10:25.034 --> 02:10:27.817
<v Marwan Altaie>It's something we could talk about.
And so just something.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/694-0
02:10:28.817 --> 02:10:32.672
<v Marwan Altaie>But I think it's worth bearing in mind as
well, Jim, this isn't in show. Oh, yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/694-1
02:10:32.672 --> 02:10:34.948
<v Marwan Altaie>either.
So we've got a longer lead time for this</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/694-2
02:10:34.948 --> 02:10:37.595
<v Marwan Altaie>as well. Yeah.
So you could embed this and then we could</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/694-3
02:10:37.595 --> 02:10:38.617
<v Marwan Altaie>piggyback on it. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/695-0
02:10:43.697 --> 02:10:46.789
<v Marwan Altaie>But like this is probably the easiest one
of the batch, so thanks.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/695-1
02:10:46.789 --> 02:10:50.620
<v Marwan Altaie>Thanks for starting us out with the easy
one. It's just gonna get harder from now.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/695-2
02:10:50.620 --> 02:10:53.482
<v Marwan Altaie>Everyone and SLA or timing elements.
Do we want any triggers?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/695-3
02:10:53.482 --> 02:10:56.989
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we have any kind of contractual
obligations for these changes? Nope. No,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/695-4
02:10:56.989 --> 02:10:58.697
<v Marwan Altaie>there's no. I'm just trying to think.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/696-0
02:10:59.217 --> 02:11:02.206
<v Marwan Altaie>The expectation if if I'm a partner,
I'm requesting it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/696-1
02:11:02.206 --> 02:11:05.301
<v Marwan Altaie>how quickly would I expect it to be done
yesterday? Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/696-2
02:11:05.301 --> 02:11:09.144
<v Marwan Altaie>it's probably more an internal measure
for you guys. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/696-3
02:11:09.144 --> 02:11:12.293
<v Marwan Altaie>That's what I was thinking.
The SLA rather than the. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/696-4
02:11:12.293 --> 02:11:16.776
<v Marwan Altaie>The last problem they will only I think I
think we should have an expectation on us</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/696-5
02:11:16.776 --> 02:11:18.697
<v Marwan Altaie>and how soon we complete it I think.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/697-0
02:11:18.857 --> 02:11:22.109
<v Marwan Altaie>Pleased to vote exercise the business.
We should. Yeah. In Europe,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/697-1
02:11:22.109 --> 02:11:25.457
<v Marwan Altaie>what tends to happen is you're asked to
make these amendments after.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/698-0
02:11:26.737 --> 02:11:29.682
<v Marwan Altaie>The client,
so the the client's live on the system in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/698-1
02:11:29.682 --> 02:11:34.045
<v Marwan Altaie>terms of being agreed with the partner
and what you'll find is we are having to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/698-2
02:11:34.045 --> 02:11:38.299
<v Marwan Altaie>make the manual override to suit what the
agreement with the client is at the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/698-3
02:11:38.299 --> 02:11:40.916
<v Marwan Altaie>outset.
So the partner are already be aware and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/698-4
02:11:40.916 --> 02:11:44.897
<v Marwan Altaie>it's just a case of us essentially
tidying up the admin and updating the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/698-5
02:11:44.897 --> 02:11:46.097
<v Marwan Altaie>payment terms. So the.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/699-0
02:11:46.337 --> 02:11:51.692
<v Marwan Altaie>Partner will already have visibility of
what's happening with that client on</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/699-1
02:11:51.692 --> 02:11:56.977
<v Marwan Altaie>their debt reports as they see them,
so there's no in terms of us having a.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/700-0
02:11:58.497 --> 02:12:02.471
<v Marwan Altaie>You know the the the time frame's already
been agreed with the client. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/700-1
02:12:02.471 --> 02:12:06.014
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's essentially it's just that it's
just the final stage of the admin</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/700-2
02:12:06.014 --> 02:12:09.270
<v Marwan Altaie>exercise that we're having to take care
of. OK. You know, it's not.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/700-3
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:11.712
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's always assuming everything's
already done.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/700-4
02:12:11.712 --> 02:12:15.064
<v Marwan Altaie>This is purely track ticket close and
that's. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/700-5
02:12:15.064 --> 02:12:17.697
<v Marwan Altaie>How soon would you think it's reasonable
if a partner.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/702-0
02:12:18.057 --> 02:12:22.819
<v Marwan Altaie>Puts the request in for us to say I've
agreed 60 day client payment terms with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/702-1
02:12:22.819 --> 02:12:25.712
<v Marwan Altaie>the client.
I said to us how how soon would you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/702-2
02:12:25.712 --> 02:12:29.207
<v Marwan Altaie>expect us to do it?
Like how it's feasible? App 48 hours.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/702-3
02:12:29.207 --> 02:12:32.281
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. Yeah,
it would be as and when it's received.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/702-4
02:12:32.281 --> 02:12:35.777
<v Marwan Altaie>It's such a a basic process. So 48 hours.
Silly question.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/703-0
02:12:37.777 --> 02:12:42.171
<v Marwan Altaie>Does it come up often that partners say
this is what our grade payment terms are</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/703-1
02:12:42.171 --> 02:12:46.401
<v Marwan Altaie>always want to be built for next week?
Like is there a short turn around time</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/703-2
02:12:46.401 --> 02:12:48.788
<v Marwan Altaie>between updating or changing payment
terms?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/703-3
02:12:48.788 --> 02:12:52.693
<v Marwan Altaie>And when the first bill when they want
their first bill to go out, yes,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/703-4
02:12:52.693 --> 02:12:54.537
<v Marwan Altaie>potentially OK. Potentially, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/704-0
02:12:55.177 --> 02:12:56.097
<v Marwan Altaie>And I mean.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/706-0
02:12:57.497 --> 02:13:01.167
<v Marwan Altaie>They could have already raised the first
bill, and then they'd be asking, yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/706-1
02:13:01.167 --> 02:13:04.654
<v Marwan Altaie>payment terms are pretty more likely
because they've looked at the bill and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/706-2
02:13:04.654 --> 02:13:07.452
<v Marwan Altaie>thought, oh crap,
the the the payment terms are wrong. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/706-3
02:13:07.452 --> 02:13:11.306
<v Marwan Altaie>So is there something that we potentially
want to put on the forum then to see when</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/706-4
02:13:11.306 --> 02:13:13.325
<v Marwan Altaie>does this need to be active by? Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/706-5
02:13:13.325 --> 02:13:16.857
<v Marwan Altaie>And we could have them provide that date
to us. And that comes in your team.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/707-0
02:13:17.457 --> 02:13:21.262
<v Marwan Altaie>You know it's priority because actually
it needs to be done today because we're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/707-1
02:13:21.262 --> 02:13:25.210
<v Marwan Altaie>billing tomorrow or it's very good shout
because it the changes are retrospective.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/707-2
02:13:25.210 --> 02:13:28.396
<v Marwan Altaie>So when you go in and change the payment
terms, it doesn't change.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/707-3
02:13:28.396 --> 02:13:31.726
<v Marwan Altaie>All the invoices are in the system.
It's only every invoice. In fact,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/707-4
02:13:31.726 --> 02:13:35.531
<v Marwan Altaie>it's only every bill that has a pro forma
raised before the change. Yeah. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/707-5
02:13:35.531 --> 02:13:36.577
<v Marwan Altaie>that actually impacts.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/708-0
02:13:36.897 --> 02:13:39.602
<v Marwan Altaie>Is there a way? Well then,
if we're needing to,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/708-1
02:13:39.602 --> 02:13:44.109
<v Marwan Altaie>if there's ever a time that we need to
reverse an invoice and then reissue with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/708-2
02:13:44.109 --> 02:13:47.659
<v Marwan Altaie>updated payment terms,
is there a way that we can link in with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/708-3
02:13:47.659 --> 02:13:52.110
<v Marwan Altaie>billing cashiers to make that happen?
Because obviously there's not much point</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/708-4
02:13:52.110 --> 02:13:52.617
<v Marwan Altaie>or we'll.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/709-0
02:13:52.897 --> 02:13:55.008
<v Marwan Altaie>Kind of.
Both have to happen at the same time,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/709-1
02:13:55.008 --> 02:13:57.298
<v Marwan Altaie>essentially,
but then the new invoice to be raised</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/709-2
02:13:57.298 --> 02:14:00.127
<v Marwan Altaie>with the new payment terms.
That's a very good point actually,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/709-3
02:14:00.127 --> 02:14:03.630
<v Marwan Altaie>because that's a really good point.
If can you not have those restated by the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/709-4
02:14:03.630 --> 02:14:05.965
<v Marwan Altaie>PE though? Yeah,
they have to is in the body of the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/709-5
02:14:05.965 --> 02:14:09.423
<v Marwan Altaie>invoice can be amended to suit the
updated payment terms, amend the draught.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/709-6
02:14:09.423 --> 02:14:12.297
<v Marwan Altaie>But then I think the finalised,
I think it overwrites it, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/710-0
02:14:12.457 --> 02:14:16.848
<v Marwan Altaie>If he picks for the matter of clients,
I think you need to you kind of want to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/710-1
02:14:16.848 --> 02:14:21.516
<v Marwan Altaie>check that says if a request has come in,
is there any draught bills that currently</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/710-2
02:14:21.516 --> 02:14:25.296
<v Marwan Altaie>exist out there? If there is,
you need to go and change the payment</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/710-3
02:14:25.296 --> 02:14:28.297
<v Marwan Altaie>terms. If there isn't good to go,
even if that's why.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/711-0
02:14:29.497 --> 02:14:32.353
<v Marwan Altaie>Are you saying the draught bills would
need to be updated manually? Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/711-1
02:14:32.353 --> 02:14:34.630
<v Marwan Altaie>I think I I you don't think they do? Oh,
no. I was saying.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/711-2
02:14:34.630 --> 02:14:37.061
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't want that to happen.
I don't think you're not changing</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/711-3
02:14:37.061 --> 02:14:38.837
<v Marwan Altaie>anything. No, no, no, no.
But you need to go.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/711-4
02:14:38.837 --> 02:14:40.959
<v Marwan Altaie>You need to go and re pull the
information. Basically,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/711-5
02:14:40.959 --> 02:14:43.661
<v Marwan Altaie>you just update the draught and then it
pulls up the new information.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/711-6
02:14:43.661 --> 02:14:44.857
<v Marwan Altaie>It's like bringing in more WIP.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/712-0
02:14:45.297 --> 02:14:48.819
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. So I think it's separate. No,
you wouldn't manually amend the bill. No,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/712-1
02:14:48.819 --> 02:14:51.257
<v Marwan Altaie>no, no, absolutely not.
I'm just thinking that, yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/712-2
02:14:51.257 --> 02:14:54.778
<v Marwan Altaie>if there's ever a time that an invoice
has to be reversed to be reissued with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/712-3
02:14:54.778 --> 02:14:57.803
<v Marwan Altaie>the updated payment terms,
then you guys will need to know when an</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/712-4
02:14:57.803 --> 02:14:58.977
<v Marwan Altaie>invoice is being reissued.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/714-0
02:15:01.097 --> 02:15:04.574
<v Marwan Altaie>So that the PES know to raise the new one
with the new payment terms,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/714-1
02:15:04.574 --> 02:15:07.653
<v Marwan Altaie>if that makes sense.
I think that sounds like both would need</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/714-2
02:15:07.653 --> 02:15:11.030
<v Marwan Altaie>to happen at the same time,
if not updating the payment terms prior</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/714-3
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:15.202
<v Marwan Altaie>to the invoice being reversed so that the
PES aren't too quick off the mark to then</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/714-4
02:15:15.202 --> 02:15:19.175
<v Marwan Altaie>recreate the invoice without the update
payment terms because we know that that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/714-5
02:15:19.175 --> 02:15:20.417
<v Marwan Altaie>could potentially happen.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/715-0
02:15:20.497 --> 02:15:23.437
<v Marwan Altaie>Then we may not know that invoices come
in first,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/715-1
02:15:23.437 --> 02:15:26.730
<v Marwan Altaie>so you've issued the invoice with 30 day
payment terms.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/715-2
02:15:26.730 --> 02:15:30.905
<v Marwan Altaie>They've got the invoice that said, Oh no,
it's wrong. It should be 45.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/715-3
02:15:30.905 --> 02:15:33.257
<v Marwan Altaie>So they put the request in to change it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/716-0
02:15:35.097 --> 02:15:38.543
<v Marwan Altaie>But I reverse it and it's not been
changed in the system they reissue it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/716-1
02:15:38.543 --> 02:15:41.664
<v Marwan Altaie>it's still gonna have 30 on it,
so they would need to rate for the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/716-2
02:15:41.664 --> 02:15:44.970
<v Marwan Altaie>request to be processed or 45 before they
re issued the invoice. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/716-3
02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:47.066
<v Marwan Altaie>because you don't see the reversal
requests.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/716-4
02:15:47.066 --> 02:15:50.745
<v Marwan Altaie>You just see when an invoice has been
done, when an invoice has been reversed.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/716-5
02:15:50.745 --> 02:15:51.537
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, so I think.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/717-0
02:15:51.937 --> 02:15:54.385
<v Marwan Altaie>What it sounds like 2 requests would have
to go in,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/717-1
02:15:54.385 --> 02:15:58.057
<v Marwan Altaie>but neither team that needs to actually
both requests would see the other one</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/717-2
02:15:58.057 --> 02:16:01.353
<v Marwan Altaie>going in if that makes sense.
So that's what I'm thinking about is we</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/717-3
02:16:01.353 --> 02:16:05.166
<v Marwan Altaie>don't need to go back to the partner to
see your payment terms of being updated,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/717-4
02:16:05.166 --> 02:16:08.697
<v Marwan Altaie>but are there other teams that we should
be informing at that time to see?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/718-0
02:16:09.057 --> 02:16:13.149
<v Marwan Altaie>Change of payment terms and then it's up
to them to do their cheques.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/718-1
02:16:13.149 --> 02:16:17.240
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't know where it sits at the moment,
what team it sits in. Well,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/718-2
02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:22.033
<v Marwan Altaie>it could be PES or billing team and it's
only relevant if there is a draught bill</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/718-3
02:16:22.033 --> 02:16:24.137
<v Marwan Altaie>out there. Yeah, otherwise it's not.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/719-0
02:16:25.817 --> 02:16:30.151
<v Marwan Altaie>You don't know Scott. If. If that happens,
then that happens kind of thing,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/719-1
02:16:30.151 --> 02:16:34.200
<v Marwan Altaie>but you can't check if there's a draught
bill we could do. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/719-2
02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:38.079
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that something that you would be
wanting to add in your process?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/719-3
02:16:38.079 --> 02:16:42.641
<v Marwan Altaie>It depends because someone said they were
doing client level changes in the 300</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/719-4
02:16:42.641 --> 02:16:43.097
<v Marwan Altaie>matters.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/720-0
02:16:43.617 --> 02:16:46.632
<v Marwan Altaie>And now I don't wanna look at 300
different matters. So, man,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/720-1
02:16:46.632 --> 02:16:50.036
<v Marwan Altaie>you're each got us with you.
But isn't that something that we can see</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/720-2
02:16:50.036 --> 02:16:52.614
<v Marwan Altaie>from the system? We can create sub tasks.
But again,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/720-3
02:16:52.614 --> 02:16:56.066
<v Marwan Altaie>because there's no integrations,
anything like this would need to be a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/720-4
02:16:56.066 --> 02:16:58.790
<v Marwan Altaie>manual action.
So if you identify one of these scenario</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/720-5
02:16:58.790 --> 02:17:01.659
<v Marwan Altaie>three, right, three,
you have to go in three and check was</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/720-6
02:17:01.659 --> 02:17:02.777
<v Marwan Altaie>dropped. It was like a.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/721-0
02:17:02.897 --> 02:17:04.657
<v Marwan Altaie>Check box that says it was drafted or not.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/722-0
02:17:06.617 --> 02:17:11.872
<v Marwan Altaie>I think ultimately what we're trying to
do is as a long or an overarching benefit</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/722-1
02:17:11.872 --> 02:17:16.037
<v Marwan Altaie>is reduce reissuing bills.
It feels like there's something here,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/722-2
02:17:16.037 --> 02:17:18.921
<v Marwan Altaie>but I don't quite know what the solution
is,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/722-3
02:17:18.921 --> 02:17:24.239
<v Marwan Altaie>so it's maybe just something to take note
of if if we're going for digitization of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/722-4
02:17:24.239 --> 02:17:25.777
<v Marwan Altaie>whip, that whip reports.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/723-0
02:17:25.977 --> 02:17:30.126
<v Marwan Altaie>Potentially use your credit control,
but would it be identified on that credit</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/723-1
02:17:30.126 --> 02:17:34.276
<v Marwan Altaie>control spreadsheet documents that you
have at the moment? No, no, no, no. OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/723-2
02:17:34.276 --> 02:17:37.217
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, it's something quite new.
You just wouldn't know.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/724-0
02:17:39.097 --> 02:17:43.199
<v Marwan Altaie>The only way you'd know if there was you
would know for the whip document,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/724-1
02:17:43.199 --> 02:17:47.738
<v Marwan Altaie>because that's got a draught bill tick on
it that says if a draught bill currently</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/724-2
02:17:47.738 --> 02:17:48.777
<v Marwan Altaie>exists on a matter.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/725-0
02:17:50.257 --> 02:17:53.853
<v Marwan Altaie>But again, that's reliant on that.
The whip data being there.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/725-1
02:17:53.853 --> 02:17:57.796
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it an easier solution for it not to be
a credit control process,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/725-2
02:17:57.796 --> 02:18:01.624
<v Marwan Altaie>given that all credit control I'm doing
is checking the approval,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/725-3
02:18:01.624 --> 02:18:04.697
<v Marwan Altaie>amending the terms?
If you're then creating another?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/726-0
02:18:05.777 --> 02:18:09.593
<v Marwan Altaie>There's then a further line of
communication after that point,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/726-1
02:18:09.593 --> 02:18:13.470
<v Marwan Altaie>with billing in the PE.
Does it not make more sense for the box</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/726-2
02:18:13.470 --> 02:18:16.377
<v Marwan Altaie>ticking exercise to sit with billing or
the PE?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/727-0
02:18:18.177 --> 02:18:22.198
<v Marwan Altaie>Problem is that then you've got them
raising invoices and then updating</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/727-1
02:18:22.198 --> 02:18:25.382
<v Marwan Altaie>invoices based on or should be an
approval and is there.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/727-2
02:18:25.382 --> 02:18:30.017
<v Marwan Altaie>There's an element of segregation duties.
I'm not sure if they should be doing it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/728-0
02:18:32.497 --> 02:18:36.719
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, but I mean,
what's the solution then for credit</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/728-1
02:18:36.719 --> 02:18:41.880
<v Marwan Altaie>control the the billing team,
the PS alter liaise over an amended</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/728-2
02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:46.337
<v Marwan Altaie>amended payment terms for an invoice that
has to go out?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/729-0
02:18:48.497 --> 02:18:52.515
<v Marwan Altaie>You know immediately in some cases, yeah.
Look, if the request comes in,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/729-1
02:18:52.515 --> 02:18:55.433
<v Marwan Altaie>it's urgent.
And I think you need to go back to them</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/729-2
02:18:55.433 --> 02:18:59.561
<v Marwan Altaie>and say it's just now you can do it.
So I think it is back to what we said</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/729-3
02:18:59.561 --> 02:19:03.634
<v Marwan Altaie>before on that form as the PE or the
partner having the responsibility to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/729-4
02:19:03.634 --> 02:19:07.377
<v Marwan Altaie>understand if there are draught bills,
they would know that, right.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/730-0
02:19:07.857 --> 02:19:11.490
<v Marwan Altaie>They're not, some would, some wouldn't.
And maybe that's sort of something you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/730-1
02:19:11.490 --> 02:19:14.939
<v Marwan Altaie>could send back your notification.
You maybe you do know during education,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/730-2
02:19:14.939 --> 02:19:17.882
<v Marwan Altaie>every time has been changed.
Please be aware any draught bills,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/730-3
02:19:17.882 --> 02:19:20.228
<v Marwan Altaie>current existence will not have the terms
updated.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/730-4
02:19:20.228 --> 02:19:22.297
<v Marwan Altaie>You'll need to be resubmitted perhaps.
Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/731-0
02:19:22.897 --> 02:19:25.241
<v Marwan Altaie>OK,
I think there's something there that's a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/731-1
02:19:25.241 --> 02:19:28.732
<v Marwan Altaie>potential to that as well. Yeah,
I think it we just need to find a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/731-2
02:19:28.732 --> 02:19:31.336
<v Marwan Altaie>solution.
Were you thinking of the the billing of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/731-3
02:19:31.336 --> 02:19:34.097
<v Marwan Altaie>the beings doing the complex? Yes. Yeah,
yeah, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/732-0
02:19:35.657 --> 02:19:39.362
<v Marwan Altaie>If all you're looking for is,
you know somebody to read over an e-mail,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/732-1
02:19:39.362 --> 02:19:42.810
<v Marwan Altaie>confirm that the relevant approvals in
place and update, you know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/732-2
02:19:42.810 --> 02:19:45.640
<v Marwan Altaie>the box on three,
I think it's over complicating it by</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/732-3
02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:49.654
<v Marwan Altaie>putting three teams in line when that,
you know that doesn't need to be three</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/732-4
02:19:49.654 --> 02:19:52.638
<v Marwan Altaie>teams there. Yeah,
I I totally get the principle. I just,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/732-5
02:19:52.638 --> 02:19:55.417
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm not the right person to make a
decision. I don't.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/733-0
02:19:55.617 --> 02:19:57.902
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah,
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with peas.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/733-1
02:19:57.902 --> 02:20:01.328
<v Marwan Altaie>No. Yeah, I was thinking,
if you want some kind of, there's no role.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/733-2
02:20:01.328 --> 02:20:04.755
<v Marwan Altaie>There's absolutely no. No.
You're hoping they do the right thing and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/733-3
02:20:04.755 --> 02:20:07.288
<v Marwan Altaie>it's just. Yeah,
that would be the only issue with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/733-4
02:20:07.288 --> 02:20:10.913
<v Marwan Altaie>Australia is that we would have,
it would have to either sit of a globe,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/733-5
02:20:10.913 --> 02:20:13.645
<v Marwan Altaie>it can be a.
You just get people doing what they want.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/733-6
02:20:13.645 --> 02:20:14.737
<v Marwan Altaie>Well, lack of control.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/734-0
02:20:15.057 --> 02:20:19.854
<v Marwan Altaie>Thinking along the lines of billing,
because if if it's either credit control</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/734-1
02:20:19.854 --> 02:20:23.791
<v Marwan Altaie>of billing in the UK,
then naturally that would fall to the PES</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/734-2
02:20:23.791 --> 02:20:26.989
<v Marwan Altaie>in Australia,
which we agree it's not a good thing,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/734-3
02:20:26.989 --> 02:20:31.417
<v Marwan Altaie>but then we'd I'd have to bring cashiers
into the into the mix instead.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/735-0
02:20:32.497 --> 02:20:35.234
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, let's just,
I think it has to stay as credit control.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/735-1
02:20:35.234 --> 02:20:37.697
<v Marwan Altaie>I think we just need to think about a
solution, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/736-0
02:20:40.057 --> 02:20:44.550
<v Marwan Altaie>I could sorry I made that bigger than one.
That's it's. It's a good point to raise.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/736-1
02:20:44.550 --> 02:20:49.042
<v Marwan Altaie>I think it's a really good point to raise
and that's what's coming out of all these</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/736-2
02:20:49.042 --> 02:20:53.161
<v Marwan Altaie>conversations is that end to end piece
and how we actually just stop raising</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/736-3
02:20:53.161 --> 02:20:57.279
<v Marwan Altaie>bills and then having to reissue them and
reject them etcetera and just stop</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/736-4
02:20:57.279 --> 02:20:58.937
<v Marwan Altaie>invoice reversals all together.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/737-0
02:21:00.257 --> 02:21:01.137
<v Marwan Altaie>That would be ideal.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/738-0
02:21:03.697 --> 02:21:08.352
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm just thinking just potential solution
to this, so feel free to input,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/738-1
02:21:08.352 --> 02:21:13.510
<v Marwan Altaie>but if it's a ad hoc and it's not easily
identifiable which it doesn't sound like</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/738-2
02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:16.215
<v Marwan Altaie>it is,
it's more owned individually by the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/738-3
02:21:16.215 --> 02:21:19.737
<v Marwan Altaie>different partners and the different
process owners if.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/739-0
02:21:20.097 --> 02:21:22.675
<v Marwan Altaie>We did do the e-mail notification.
I know it's not ideal,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/739-1
02:21:22.675 --> 02:21:25.208
<v Marwan Altaie>but if we just had a catch all of please
check XY and Z.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/739-2
02:21:25.208 --> 02:21:28.675
<v Marwan Altaie>If there's a draught invoice that might
be the easiest way because it doesn't</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/739-3
02:21:28.675 --> 02:21:32.230
<v Marwan Altaie>sound like there's a process that we can
implement in ServiceNow without fixing</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/739-4
02:21:32.230 --> 02:21:35.697
<v Marwan Altaie>all of your other processes in advance.
Yeah, I agree and that's the problem.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/739-5
02:21:35.697 --> 02:21:39.297
<v Marwan Altaie>You don't know which touch what it is
afterwards do. It's a bit of an ad hoc so.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/740-0
02:21:39.817 --> 02:21:42.299
<v Marwan Altaie>Makes notifications reasonable to go back
and say,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/740-1
02:21:42.299 --> 02:21:46.045
<v Marwan Altaie>but if you've got any draught bills,
just be aware they won't need to update</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/740-2
02:21:46.045 --> 02:21:49.646
<v Marwan Altaie>them if you want to change it.
And is it P ES that own the draught bills,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/740-3
02:21:49.646 --> 02:21:52.224
<v Marwan Altaie>or is it billing?
Depends where you are in the world</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/740-4
02:21:52.224 --> 02:21:54.657
<v Marwan Altaie>location. OK. Billing Australia. P ES. Oh,
sorry.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/741-0
02:21:55.017 --> 02:21:58.787
<v Marwan Altaie>PES in Australia billing in the UK OK,
but the notification could go to the PES</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/741-1
02:21:58.787 --> 02:22:01.284
<v Marwan Altaie>globe. It could. There's no reason not to.
Yeah, no,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/741-2
02:22:01.284 --> 02:22:04.865
<v Marwan Altaie>they probably could because I thought
that we'd be paying request location.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/741-3
02:22:04.865 --> 02:22:07.457
<v Marwan Altaie>It could go to both depending on location
as well. OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/742-0
02:22:09.217 --> 02:22:12.950
<v Marwan Altaie>Anytime we talk about billing Australia,
you have to remember that's cashier's as</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/742-1
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:13.177
<v Marwan Altaie>well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/743-0
02:22:15.697 --> 02:22:18.236
<v Marwan Altaie>OK. I mean,
this was a relatively easy one.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/743-1
02:22:18.236 --> 02:22:22.967
<v Marwan Altaie>So the majority of it seems easy enough
to standardise and roll out once once you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/743-2
02:22:22.967 --> 02:22:26.024
<v Marwan Altaie>get to that.
The only I guess nuance is that draught</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/743-3
02:22:26.024 --> 02:22:30.005
<v Marwan Altaie>invoice that seems a bit tricky,
but we can include that now as user</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/743-4
02:22:30.005 --> 02:22:34.217
<v Marwan Altaie>stories and see what potential solutions
we have for you, I think we're.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/744-0
02:22:34.337 --> 02:22:38.777
<v Marwan Altaie>Good for this one. For the most part.
Do we have anything else anyone wants to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/744-1
02:22:38.777 --> 02:22:43.329
<v Marwan Altaie>raise for Amendment update 3 E payment
terms or we get to see what data could be</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/744-2
02:22:43.329 --> 02:22:45.577
<v Marwan Altaie>helpful in structuring and driving this?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/745-0
02:22:49.337 --> 02:22:52.801
<v Marwan Altaie>And this is like I said,
this isn't the final list,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/745-1
02:22:52.801 --> 02:22:57.397
<v Marwan Altaie>this is just kind of drive the
conversation when a request comes in.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/745-2
02:22:57.397 --> 02:23:02.858
<v Marwan Altaie>What ideally would you want them to be
sending in that request? What attachments,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/745-3
02:23:02.858 --> 02:23:04.257
<v Marwan Altaie>what references what?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/746-0
02:23:04.817 --> 02:23:08.170
<v Marwan Altaie>Numbers, currencies, regions,
anything you can think of that could be</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/746-1
02:23:08.170 --> 02:23:08.697
<v Marwan Altaie>beneficial.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/747-0
02:23:10.417 --> 02:23:12.937
<v Marwan Altaie>You need to determine whether it's matter
or a client.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/748-0
02:23:18.417 --> 02:23:21.306
<v Marwan Altaie>When you when users are picking a matter
or a client,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/748-1
02:23:21.306 --> 02:23:25.746
<v Marwan Altaie>will they select from a drop down menu or
will it be manually entering in a matter</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/748-2
02:23:25.746 --> 02:23:29.276
<v Marwan Altaie>number or a client number?
So for a drop down we'd need to have a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/748-3
02:23:29.276 --> 02:23:32.967
<v Marwan Altaie>reference point in ServiceNow.
So that means you'd have to give us a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/748-4
02:23:32.967 --> 02:23:36.177
<v Marwan Altaie>list of clients or matter numbers and
then the integration.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/749-0
02:23:37.177 --> 02:23:40.128
<v Marwan Altaie>You can also do it manually,
but then it wouldn't be up to date.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/749-1
02:23:40.128 --> 02:23:43.669
<v Marwan Altaie>So if there's a way you could do an
export and then we host it if Parrot's on</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/749-2
02:23:43.669 --> 02:23:45.620
<v Marwan Altaie>here,
the parrot can tell me if I'm on the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/749-3
02:23:45.620 --> 02:23:47.663
<v Marwan Altaie>right track.
You export manually from three.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/749-4
02:23:47.663 --> 02:23:51.295
<v Marwan Altaie>If you have a list of tables or matters,
and then you host it on ServiceNow and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/749-5
02:23:51.295 --> 02:23:53.701
<v Marwan Altaie>then you have the drop down option or
search option.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/749-6
02:23:53.701 --> 02:23:55.017
<v Marwan Altaie>But you do need that initial.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/751-0
02:23:55.777 --> 02:24:00.282
<v Marwan Altaie>Data dump if you want to call it.
But what are we doing in all other states?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/750-0
02:23:57.817 --> 02:24:01.017
<v Parik Narain>Yeah, you're right. You're right.
Tomorrow. Now we can do that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/751-1
02:24:00.282 --> 02:24:03.733
<v Marwan Altaie>Well, what are we doing?
Teams for Masters of Rep Clients,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/751-2
02:24:03.733 --> 02:24:08.120
<v Marwan Altaie>I think spoke about it last week.
We just said there'll be some validation</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/751-3
02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:11.455
<v Marwan Altaie>against the matter using the structure.
Yeah, we didn't.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/751-4
02:24:11.455 --> 02:24:15.257
<v Marwan Altaie>Didn't talk about reference to give you
an idea, Chris, we have.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/752-0
02:24:15.577 --> 02:24:21.126
<v Marwan Altaie>3 Integration into Chrome River you have
four data feeds in a 24 hour period going</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/752-1
02:24:21.126 --> 02:24:26.273
<v Marwan Altaie>for three into Chrome River to update
that data as often as possible because</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/752-2
02:24:26.273 --> 02:24:29.215
<v Marwan Altaie>matters are constantly opening and
closing.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/752-3
02:24:29.215 --> 02:24:34.496
<v Marwan Altaie>So I just don't think that it's feasible
to be getting a manual extract out of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/752-4
02:24:34.496 --> 02:24:34.897
<v Marwan Altaie>three.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/753-0
02:24:34.977 --> 02:24:39.439
<v Marwan Altaie>Putting it into ServiceNow because you'd
have to be doing it numerous times of day</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/753-1
02:24:39.439 --> 02:24:43.472
<v Marwan Altaie>just with how much our data changes.
So we're probably better off having a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/753-2
02:24:43.472 --> 02:24:47.827
<v Marwan Altaie>free text field or something like that
before we can get that integration other.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/753-3
02:24:47.827 --> 02:24:49.977
<v Marwan Altaie>It's just going to be a lot of work for.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/754-0
02:24:50.497 --> 02:24:54.163
<v Marwan Altaie>Someone that it could be someone's full
time job to do that think Tim's Tim's</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/754-1
02:24:54.163 --> 02:24:57.781
<v Marwan Altaie>proposed solution, just data validation,
all matter and invoices the correct</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/754-2
02:24:57.781 --> 02:25:01.447
<v Marwan Altaie>structure. Do you want to drop it?
Apparently they're all the same structure.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/754-3
02:25:01.447 --> 02:25:04.972
<v Marwan Altaie>All the the matter numbers are the same
structure. No, no. OK. Oh, that's.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/754-4
02:25:04.972 --> 02:25:08.120
<v Marwan Altaie>There's two. There's two variations.
There's two variations. Well,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/754-5
02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:09.577
<v Marwan Altaie>there's actually walks. You OK?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/756-0
02:25:09.737 --> 02:25:12.326
<v Marwan Altaie>Find specific ones as well. Yeah.
I'm sorry.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/756-1
02:25:12.326 --> 02:25:17.044
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm thinking no matter numbers in general,
they are 4 digits, 4 digits, 3 digits.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/756-2
02:25:17.044 --> 02:25:21.014
<v Marwan Altaie>I think the space between them 433433 or
two, but there are matters.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/756-3
02:25:21.014 --> 02:25:24.811
<v Marwan Altaie>There are client specific matter numbers
which are weird formats.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/756-4
02:25:24.811 --> 02:25:26.537
<v Marwan Altaie>So there's some some for like.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/757-0
02:25:27.217 --> 02:25:29.478
<v Marwan Altaie>I think Goldman Sachs has some around.
Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/757-1
02:25:29.478 --> 02:25:33.397
<v Marwan Altaie>there's a few key clients that we allow
to have their own style maths as well</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/757-2
02:25:33.397 --> 02:25:36.664
<v Marwan Altaie>because they want them.
And there's also some legacy Australia 1</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/757-3
02:25:36.664 --> 02:25:39.729
<v Marwan Altaie>instead of 244 as well. Yeah. So no,
they're not persisting.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/757-4
02:25:39.729 --> 02:25:43.497
<v Marwan Altaie>And what do they do? Just know,
guess they just type it out in the e-mail.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/758-0
02:25:44.697 --> 02:25:49.033
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. Yeah. Gives you matter. Yeah.
Matter. Name matter number, client name.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/758-1
02:25:49.033 --> 02:25:52.298
<v Marwan Altaie>Client name. Yeah.
You might have to go back to action or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/758-2
02:25:52.298 --> 02:25:54.663
<v Marwan Altaie>not.
You might have to be specific in the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/758-3
02:25:54.663 --> 02:25:57.197
<v Marwan Altaie>fields.
Some people will put in the 10 digit</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/758-4
02:25:57.197 --> 02:26:00.237
<v Marwan Altaie>matter numbers all in one go.
Some people add spaces.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/758-5
02:26:00.237 --> 02:26:03.897
<v Marwan Altaie>Some people add dashes.
So if we can have just consistent. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/759-0
02:26:04.377 --> 02:26:08.527
<v Marwan Altaie>What you can do as well as you can put
like the the info thing in so if you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/759-1
02:26:08.527 --> 02:26:12.951
<v Marwan Altaie>hover over can't you like and it can give
examples of what that text looks like.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/759-2
02:26:12.951 --> 02:26:16.937
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm I'm saying this would be helpful like
all the finance that is, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/760-0
02:26:20.177 --> 02:26:22.560
<v Marwan Altaie>OK,
so where I guess we're going on a trust</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/760-1
02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:25.917
<v Marwan Altaie>basis that whatever the inputs is going
to be reliable, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/760-2
02:26:25.917 --> 02:26:28.463
<v Marwan Altaie>If we're not looking up. Yeah, absolutely.
OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/760-3
02:26:28.463 --> 02:26:30.737
<v Marwan Altaie>So I'm just going to have open text field.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/762-0
02:26:30.737 --> 02:26:33.788
<v Parik Narain>Can I just? Sorry,
I just wanted to ask a couple of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/761-0
02:26:33.217 --> 02:26:33.457
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/762-1
02:26:33.788 --> 02:26:36.722
<v Parik Narain>questions.
First is the Chrome River application.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/762-2
02:26:36.722 --> 02:26:40.888
<v Parik Narain>What is it exactly? Because I I've seen,
I heard it mentioned earlier.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/762-3
02:26:40.888 --> 02:26:44.057
<v Parik Narain>May I just know a little bit more about
Chrome River?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/765-0
02:26:44.977 --> 02:26:48.219
<v Marwan Altaie>Chrome River is our expense management
systems.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/763-0
02:26:47.897 --> 02:26:48.217
<v Parik Narain>Got it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/765-1
02:26:48.219 --> 02:26:52.879
<v Marwan Altaie>That's where we manage all of our credit
card transactions and staff</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/765-2
02:26:52.879 --> 02:26:56.458
<v Marwan Altaie>reimbursements.
So it is integrated with 3A in that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/765-3
02:26:56.458 --> 02:27:01.118
<v Marwan Altaie>There's a two way data feed.
So there's times that 3A data will feed</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/764-0
02:26:58.857 --> 02:26:59.097
<v Parik Narain>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/765-4
02:27:01.118 --> 02:27:04.697
<v Marwan Altaie>directly into Chrome River so that we
have the most.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/767-0
02:27:04.737 --> 02:27:07.881
<v Marwan Altaie>To date,
costing codes team like department codes</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/767-1
02:27:07.881 --> 02:27:10.963
<v Marwan Altaie>matters,
but then the other way around we've got</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/767-2
02:27:10.963 --> 02:27:15.302
<v Marwan Altaie>data feeds going from Chrome,
rubber Chrome into 3 E to extract that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/767-3
02:27:15.302 --> 02:27:17.817
<v Marwan Altaie>information. To be able to post into 3E.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/766-0
02:27:15.857 --> 02:27:15.977
<v Parik Narain>But.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/770-0
02:27:19.857 --> 02:27:23.040
<v Parik Narain>Got it. Got it. OK.
Because we are still as as Alex mentioned</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/770-1
02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:25.401
<v Parik Narain>earlier,
because three is changing constantly</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/770-2
02:27:25.401 --> 02:27:28.686
<v Parik Narain>going to be upgraded.
We are thinking of alternative options to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/770-3
02:27:28.686 --> 02:27:32.639
<v Parik Narain>get information if at all needed what
will help up is first of all things in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/769-0
02:27:30.177 --> 02:27:30.417
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/770-4
02:27:32.639 --> 02:27:35.257
<v Parik Narain>this list which I'm seeing on the screen
they are.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/771-0
02:27:35.897 --> 02:27:39.957
<v Parik Narain>Data points which don't change a lot.
For example client and matter ID.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/771-1
02:27:39.957 --> 02:27:44.186
<v Parik Narain>They don't change if we can spot out data
which is actually possible to be</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/771-2
02:27:44.186 --> 02:27:48.527
<v Parik Narain>extracted once a day, that would help.
At least we can supplement the manual</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/771-3
02:27:48.527 --> 02:27:51.177
<v Parik Narain>information with something which comes
out of.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/773-0
02:27:51.697 --> 02:27:56.036
<v Parik Narain>3E Slash Chrome River whatever system is
the best and then enriched out with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/772-0
02:27:55.017 --> 02:27:55.857
<v Marwan Altaie>Maybe it's worth talking.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/773-1
02:27:56.036 --> 02:27:56.937
<v Parik Narain>anything manual.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/776-0
02:27:57.977 --> 02:28:03.225
<v Marwan Altaie>Maybe it's worth talking to Alex because
this integration between 3:00 and Chrome</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/776-1
02:28:03.225 --> 02:28:07.065
<v Marwan Altaie>River is a necessity.
It's going to be part of the upgrade,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/774-0
02:28:06.817 --> 02:28:07.097
<v Parik Narain>Right.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/776-2
02:28:07.065 --> 02:28:12.313
<v Marwan Altaie>so I wonder if it's worthwhile chatting
to see what that looks like from a Chrome</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/775-0
02:28:09.737 --> 02:28:09.857
<v Parik Narain>Sure.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/776-3
02:28:12.313 --> 02:28:14.937
<v Marwan Altaie>River perspective. What, how that 3 into?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/778-0
02:28:15.777 --> 02:28:18.613
<v Marwan Altaie>Chrome Robot integration is like on that
side of things,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/778-1
02:28:18.613 --> 02:28:22.742
<v Marwan Altaie>because then that might give you an idea
how to work with service now because it's</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/777-0
02:28:20.097 --> 02:28:20.457
<v Parik Narain>Sure, sure.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/778-2
02:28:22.742 --> 02:28:23.737
<v Marwan Altaie>already established.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/779-0
02:28:23.217 --> 02:28:25.857
<v Parik Narain>Great. Great. Yeah, we'll do. Thank you.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/780-0
02:28:27.617 --> 02:28:31.777
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry, is Chrome River used globally? Yes.
OK yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/781-0
02:28:33.577 --> 02:28:37.519
<v Marwan Altaie>Also known as embers. Yeah. Embers.
So it's called inverse Enterprise now,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/781-1
02:28:37.519 --> 02:28:40.672
<v Marwan Altaie>but it started as Chrome River,
and I can't change my word.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/781-2
02:28:40.672 --> 02:28:43.457
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm still used to Chrome River. Thanks.
Thanks, Tim.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/782-0
02:28:46.097 --> 02:28:48.838
<v Marwan Altaie>OK,
this seems like follow up big workshop.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/782-1
02:28:48.838 --> 02:28:53.511
<v Marwan Altaie>We need to do is that data points 'cause
that's gonna drive a lot of this.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/782-2
02:28:53.511 --> 02:28:56.377
<v Marwan Altaie>But we can we can have that further along
so.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/783-0
02:28:58.697 --> 02:29:02.127
<v Marwan Altaie>Just on this list. Again,
this doesn't have to be the final list,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/783-1
02:29:02.127 --> 02:29:05.453
<v Marwan Altaie>but it does help us create the proposed
solution to understand,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/783-2
02:29:05.453 --> 02:29:08.467
<v Marwan Altaie>like Parrot said as well,
what we might need to bring in,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/783-3
02:29:08.467 --> 02:29:11.013
<v Marwan Altaie>or what we might need to have as a manual
input,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/783-4
02:29:11.013 --> 02:29:14.703
<v Marwan Altaie>does this roughly align with what you'd
expect for this specific area,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/783-5
02:29:14.703 --> 02:29:17.977
<v Marwan Altaie>or is there stuff like probably more than
you need so request?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/784-0
02:29:18.177 --> 02:29:21.195
<v Marwan Altaie>Is relevant because you're either
changing client or matter,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/784-1
02:29:21.195 --> 02:29:24.361
<v Marwan Altaie>so there's two options.
Your region entity is not valid because</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/784-2
02:29:24.361 --> 02:29:27.082

02:29:38.446 --> 02:29:39.497
<v Marwan Altaie>It has no impact at all.</v>

02:29:45.079 --> 02:29:47.977
<v Marwan Altaie>number or name absolutely important.</v>

02:29:51.017 --> 02:29:54.070
<v Marwan Altaie>Effective date? Well,
it's the date as soon as you do it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/787-1
02:29:54.070 --> 02:29:58.333
<v Marwan Altaie>it's effective from you wouldn't ever ask
for payment terms to be changed in six</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/787-2
02:29:58.333 --> 02:30:01.333

You want it done there and then.</v>

02:30:01.333 --> 02:30:05.491
<v Marwan Altaie>So the effective date is kind of when
it's when the request is received and is</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/787-4

02:30:15.363 --> 02:30:18.643
<v Marwan Altaie>I think you could take that out because
your request type is either client or</v>

02:30:25.430 --> 02:30:29.463
<v Marwan Altaie>It does not probably not relevant just on
the request type.</v>

02:30:29.463 --> 02:30:32.017
<v Marwan Altaie>Can it ever be both client and matter?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/792-0
02:30:35.017 --> 02:30:35.417

02:30:38.857 --> 02:30:40.937
<v Marwan Altaie>Our requested terms are obviously

02:30:40.937 --> 02:30:44.057
<v Marwan Altaie>This is where we put our over 60 day
check box or whatever it is.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/794-0

02:30:49.937 --> 02:30:53.769
<v Marwan Altaie>We ever ask a reasonable if it was
judging day care fundamentally,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/795-1
02:30:53.769 --> 02:30:56.057
<v Marwan Altaie>as I agree with fine, I would say, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/796-0
02:30:57.537 --> 02:31:01.966
<v Marwan Altaie>You wouldn't extend the terms as an
allowance if a bill had run over terms as</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/796-1
02:31:01.966 --> 02:31:03.897
<v Marwan Altaie>a client request, so that came in.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/797-0
02:31:05.417 --> 02:31:10.353
<v Marwan Altaie>There was a region that came in recently.
That's a few months ago where the partner</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/797-1
02:31:10.353 --> 02:31:14.466
<v Marwan Altaie>had said it's run over terms.
The client says they're going to pay on</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/797-2
02:31:14.466 --> 02:31:17.697
<v Marwan Altaie>day 60. Can we change the payment terms,
you know, so.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/798-0
02:31:19.217 --> 02:31:21.419
<v Marwan Altaie>The the Bills essentially been paid on
time.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/798-1
02:31:21.419 --> 02:31:24.697
<v Marwan Altaie>That's a request that we couldn't agree
to. So what have you know,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/798-2
02:31:24.697 --> 02:31:27.681
<v Marwan Altaie>the the reason we'd only ever be as
agreed with with client,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/798-3
02:31:27.681 --> 02:31:31.546
<v Marwan Altaie>but certainly wouldn't be backdated to
allow for a bill to appear to have been</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/798-4
02:31:31.546 --> 02:31:34.921
<v Marwan Altaie>paid within payment terms.
You can have a as you get a free text box</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/798-5
02:31:34.921 --> 02:31:38.297
<v Marwan Altaie>might be relevant mind it just to see the
have an optionality there.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/799-0
02:31:38.777 --> 02:31:42.224
<v Marwan Altaie>Because it's going to be useful to know
the reasons. If you don't want to,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/799-1
02:31:42.224 --> 02:31:44.522
<v Marwan Altaie>it doesn't.
It might be if if you were looking at</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/799-2
02:31:44.522 --> 02:31:47.050
<v Marwan Altaie>stuff to say,
why do we keep changing payment terms on</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/799-3
02:31:47.050 --> 02:31:49.578
<v Marwan Altaie>these matters?
And actually it's because people put in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/799-4
02:31:49.578 --> 02:31:53.163
<v Marwan Altaie>the wrong payment terms in when it's a
client level payment terms and they're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/799-5
02:31:53.163 --> 02:31:53.577
<v Marwan Altaie>just not.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/800-0
02:31:54.017 --> 02:31:57.598
<v Marwan Altaie>Ignoring them might be good to find
trends in that, so it might be useful.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/800-1
02:31:57.598 --> 02:32:01.371
<v Marwan Altaie>It's just about what the partners of PES
are going to be happy to do if that's</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/800-2
02:32:01.371 --> 02:32:05.047
<v Marwan Altaie>going to be one of those ones with like
maybe, maybe you put it as optional.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/800-3
02:32:05.047 --> 02:32:07.674
<v Marwan Altaie>You know it's not compulsory.
Someone's put reasoning,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/800-4
02:32:07.674 --> 02:32:09.297
<v Marwan Altaie>they're great if they don't. Well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/801-0
02:32:10.017 --> 02:32:12.881
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean,
can you put in like a drop down box so</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/801-1
02:32:12.881 --> 02:32:17.756
<v Marwan Altaie>you just have three or four set reasons
that you're happy with and it's like no</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/801-2
02:32:17.756 --> 02:32:22.265
<v Marwan Altaie>reason this reason this reason,
so they just kind of select A drop from a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/801-3
02:32:22.265 --> 02:32:27.383
<v Marwan Altaie>drop down rather than having it free text.
And then if you do want to report on it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/801-4
02:32:27.383 --> 02:32:29.577
<v Marwan Altaie>you've got some really basic things.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/802-0
02:32:29.897 --> 02:32:32.539
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, I mean, we could do. Yeah,
absolutely. I mean, yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/802-1
02:32:32.539 --> 02:32:35.091
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm thinking it might help us all but
approve or reject.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/802-2
02:32:35.091 --> 02:32:38.808
<v Marwan Altaie>So whoever needs to then pick this up and
actually do approve all having a reason,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/802-3
02:32:38.808 --> 02:32:42.345
<v Marwan Altaie>even if it's not necessarily needed.
It just gives them a good reference point</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/802-4
02:32:42.345 --> 02:32:44.897
<v Marwan Altaie>of. Oh, OK, fine. Good to go. Yeah, yeah,
we know. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/803-0
02:32:45.657 --> 02:32:49.642
<v Marwan Altaie>But we can leave it as an optional open
text box so it doesn't force people down</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/803-1
02:32:49.642 --> 02:32:53.333
<v Marwan Altaie>that route if if that's the concern,
that might be the nice middle ground.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/803-2
02:32:53.333 --> 02:32:57.318
<v Marwan Altaie>I guess the my concerns with drop down
boxes are people have a very bad habit of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/803-3
02:32:57.318 --> 02:33:01.057
<v Marwan Altaie>picking the first one of the drop down
and how how good is the information.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/804-0
02:33:01.697 --> 02:33:05.406
<v Marwan Altaie>Whereas if you get free text box,
if someone's bothering to type it in the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/804-1
02:33:05.406 --> 02:33:07.878
<v Marwan Altaie>chart starts could be better quality
information.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/804-2
02:33:07.878 --> 02:33:11.439
<v Marwan Altaie>So get it really inconsistently.
People just let's see it's a free text</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/804-3
02:33:11.439 --> 02:33:15.494
<v Marwan Altaie>and just put whatever you know they do.
But honestly you see haven't bought input</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/804-4
02:33:15.494 --> 02:33:16.977
<v Marwan Altaie>drop down boxes on our intact.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/805-0
02:33:17.777 --> 02:33:21.313
<v Marwan Altaie>They pick the first thing that comes to
mind, and this is partners MPs.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/805-1
02:33:21.313 --> 02:33:24.603
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's a yeah, I mean small,
small lot of probably better quality</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/805-2
02:33:24.603 --> 02:33:28.483
<v Marwan Altaie>information or a lot of crap or which is
better or just don't put it on there.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/805-3
02:33:28.483 --> 02:33:31.675
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. That's the option.
I just wonder if it's something that we</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/805-4
02:33:31.675 --> 02:33:35.358
<v Marwan Altaie>don't put on there to start with just
bearing in mind the whole big change</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/805-5
02:33:35.358 --> 02:33:36.537
<v Marwan Altaie>curve that we're having.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/806-0
02:33:37.137 --> 02:33:42.336
<v Marwan Altaie>And actually you're if you get to a point
where you're reporting and you see that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/806-1
02:33:42.336 --> 02:33:47.535
<v Marwan Altaie>it's the same partner that's asking for
stuff that's maybe something that we then</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/806-2
02:33:47.535 --> 02:33:52.543
<v Marwan Altaie>add on. Yeah. Yeah. We go through. OK,
is there no scenario where they need to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/806-3
02:33:52.543 --> 02:33:56.537
<v Marwan Altaie>go back and confirm why something's been
raised or if they're?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/807-0
02:33:56.617 --> 02:33:58.647
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm.
I'm just thinking about the clarity side</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/807-1
02:33:58.647 --> 02:34:00.810
<v Marwan Altaie>to make it optimal and as efficient as
possible.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/807-2
02:34:00.810 --> 02:34:04.252
<v Marwan Altaie>You want to consolidate as much useful,
useful being the keyword information.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/807-3
02:34:04.252 --> 02:34:07.783
<v Marwan Altaie>If it's not useful, it's completely fine,
but it saves them from going back and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/807-4
02:34:07.783 --> 02:34:08.577
<v Marwan Altaie>forth potentially.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/808-0
02:34:11.377 --> 02:34:15.153
<v Marwan Altaie>As long as you've got the approvals,
I can't think of any reason why you would</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/808-1
02:34:15.153 --> 02:34:18.880
<v Marwan Altaie>need to go back the approvals there.
You just have to accept it as things for</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/808-2
02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:22.034
<v Marwan Altaie>whether we like it or not.
We just have to suck it up. That's it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/808-3
02:34:22.034 --> 02:34:25.045
<v Marwan Altaie>So the attachment is going to drive it.
Yeah. Basically. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/808-4
02:34:25.045 --> 02:34:27.817
<v Marwan Altaie>That's completely fine.
Attachment or the OR the request.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/809-0
02:34:28.097 --> 02:34:31.776
<v Marwan Altaie>For the partner,
who obviously doesn't need to put the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/809-1
02:34:31.776 --> 02:34:37.060
<v Marwan Altaie>attachment in if it's below 6 to is it in
this table that we want to ask about</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/809-2
02:34:37.060 --> 02:34:42.412
<v Marwan Altaie>about currently issued invoices to be
reversed or drop? What's improved or not?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/809-3
02:34:42.412 --> 02:34:44.017
<v Marwan Altaie>Or is that another area?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/810-0
02:34:45.937 --> 02:34:50.981
<v Marwan Altaie>The problem is if you do a client level,
they're not necessarily going to know if</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/810-1
02:34:50.981 --> 02:34:55.102
<v Marwan Altaie>there's bills out there,
because that might be sitting in another.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/810-2
02:34:55.102 --> 02:34:58.670
<v Marwan Altaie>Partners matters,
but so you could do it if it's a matter</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/810-3
02:34:58.670 --> 02:35:00.577
<v Marwan Altaie>level request. Just a reminder.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/811-0
02:35:01.337 --> 02:35:02.937
<v Marwan Altaie>You could do it,
but if it's a client level.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/813-0
02:35:04.377 --> 02:35:08.974
<v Marwan Altaie>It probably wouldn't be as red as a town.
So what is the question we're asking at</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/813-1
02:35:08.974 --> 02:35:12.282
<v Marwan Altaie>matter level then?
Could it be a tick box to see are there</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/813-2
02:35:12.282 --> 02:35:15.982
<v Marwan Altaie>currently draught bills?
Does that make like does that make sense</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/813-3
02:35:15.982 --> 02:35:18.617
<v Marwan Altaie>or yeah,
so if it was a massive level request?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/814-0
02:35:20.097 --> 02:35:24.353
<v Marwan Altaie>But you'd almost just put a pop-up that
says or something that says if there are</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/814-1
02:35:24.353 --> 02:35:27.926
<v Marwan Altaie>any draught bills out there.
Please be aware these will need to be,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/814-2
02:35:27.926 --> 02:35:31.761
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't know what there's a word for it,
like regenerating or something.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/814-3
02:35:31.761 --> 02:35:33.337
<v Marwan Altaie>So they pick up the new terms.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/815-0
02:35:35.697 --> 02:35:38.097
<v Marwan Altaie>Whether that's a tick box, I don't.
I don't know how to know.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/816-0
02:35:39.897 --> 02:35:41.977
<v Marwan Altaie>Whether it's a notification afterwards,
yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/816-1
02:35:41.977 --> 02:35:45.097
<v Marwan Altaie>I think we want to prompt them to think
about draught bills, though,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/816-2
02:35:45.097 --> 02:35:46.137
<v Marwan Altaie>don't we at this stage?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/817-0
02:35:47.857 --> 02:35:51.485
<v Marwan Altaie>Because it will be on the onus of the PE
or the partner who's raising it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/817-1
02:35:51.485 --> 02:35:54.427
<v Marwan Altaie>That's a level. Yeah.
So if it's matter level request type,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/817-2
02:35:54.427 --> 02:35:57.810
<v Marwan Altaie>could there be we can have a,
we can have a sentence at the top like</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/817-3
02:35:57.810 --> 02:36:01.536
<v Marwan Altaie>the solution doesn't have to be complex,
literally be if you have a draught</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/817-4
02:36:01.536 --> 02:36:03.497
<v Marwan Altaie>invoice, please check before submission.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/818-0
02:36:04.017 --> 02:36:07.594
<v Marwan Altaie>It could be something like that.
Will they read it? Well, they don't,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/818-1
02:36:07.594 --> 02:36:11.376
<v Marwan Altaie>and then they issue the invoice.
It's wrong payment terms and that's from</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/818-2
02:36:11.376 --> 02:36:13.727
<v Marwan Altaie>them.
And they could redo it again until it's</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/818-3
02:36:13.727 --> 02:36:16.026
<v Marwan Altaie>right.
And that's probably fancy educational</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/818-4
02:36:16.026 --> 02:36:17.457
<v Marwan Altaie>pieces. The last year, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/819-0
02:36:18.977 --> 02:36:19.777
<v Marwan Altaie>I would need a clue.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/820-0
02:36:21.177 --> 02:36:24.657
<v Marwan Altaie>Client actual client level, yeah, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/821-0
02:36:31.857 --> 02:36:35.712
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool. We can. We can take away the how?
We'll show that draught invoice. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/821-1
02:36:35.712 --> 02:36:38.542
<v Marwan Altaie>Top of my head. The simplest solution.
And like you said,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/821-2
02:36:38.542 --> 02:36:41.762
<v Marwan Altaie>if they come back and said well,
we didn't know it's right there.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/821-3
02:36:41.762 --> 02:36:43.958
<v Marwan Altaie>So the onus isn't on you guys.
It's on them.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/821-4
02:36:43.958 --> 02:36:45.617
<v Marwan Altaie>Should make it easier potentially.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/822-0
02:36:47.577 --> 02:36:50.632
<v Marwan Altaie>Something you might want to catch on the
back end though,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/822-1
02:36:50.632 --> 02:36:53.897
<v Marwan Altaie>if there's draught invoices out there so
you're approving it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/822-2
02:36:53.897 --> 02:36:58.322
<v Marwan Altaie>But you've also noticed that there's some
draught invoices we could have a field in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/822-3
02:36:58.322 --> 02:37:02.640
<v Marwan Altaie>there that's capturing that and so it's
something you could report on that you're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/822-4
02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:05.537
<v Marwan Altaie>doing some updates and there's some
invoices that are.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/823-0
02:37:05.577 --> 02:37:08.978
<v Marwan Altaie>In draught Tim,
do you think that that is information</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/823-1
02:37:08.978 --> 02:37:13.891
<v Marwan Altaie>that would be easy to integrate like that
would be easy to pick up through an</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/823-2
02:37:13.891 --> 02:37:19.182
<v Marwan Altaie>integration from three E yeah, from three.
If we were gonna do a three integration.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/823-3
02:37:19.182 --> 02:37:24.472
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that something where you could kind of
put a matter number in? And it said, hey,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/823-4
02:37:24.472 --> 02:37:25.417
<v Marwan Altaie>you've got 4/4.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/824-0
02:37:25.577 --> 02:37:28.980
<v Marwan Altaie>Invoices in pro forma they need to be
changed like these need to be changed.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/824-1
02:37:28.980 --> 02:37:31.367
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, you would.
Or just my best case scenario. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/824-2
02:37:31.367 --> 02:37:34.461
<v Marwan Altaie>I think from an integration perspective
if you can. Yeah, absolutely.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/824-3
02:37:34.461 --> 02:37:37.466
<v Marwan Altaie>The question is do we get there
integration knocks quite out of the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/824-4
02:37:37.466 --> 02:37:40.957
<v Marwan Altaie>matter instead if a bill exists or not.
So it's literally just a case of recap</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/824-5
02:37:40.957 --> 02:37:43.432
<v Marwan Altaie>data between.
So that's probably not day one I suppose.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/824-6
02:37:43.432 --> 02:37:45.377
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, of course. But yeah,
can we put that?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/825-0
02:37:45.417 --> 02:37:49.798
<v Marwan Altaie>But in a third,
I would love to have first backlog item</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/825-1
02:37:49.798 --> 02:37:50.737
<v Marwan Altaie>as well for.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/826-0
02:37:52.217 --> 02:37:54.535
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean,
it'd be really nice to have that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/826-1
02:37:54.535 --> 02:37:57.250
<v Marwan Altaie>integration because if you just chose a
matter,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/826-2
02:37:57.250 --> 02:38:01.434
<v Marwan Altaie>it could then populate a lot of those
other fields for you straight away.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/826-3
02:38:01.434 --> 02:38:04.657
<v Marwan Altaie>Exactly. You're beautiful. But yeah,
Marwin over to you.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/827-0
02:38:07.097 --> 02:38:11.749
<v Marwan Altaie>One day we'll get integration. OK.
Are we happy so far with the amended</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/827-1
02:38:11.749 --> 02:38:14.657
<v Marwan Altaie>process and the data we're going to
capture.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/828-0
02:38:18.057 --> 02:38:21.197
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool. So I've I've made a note of that.
I'll make the changes and then of course</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/828-1
02:38:21.197 --> 02:38:24.104
<v Marwan Altaie>after the session I'll I'll summarise
everything and you guys can validate</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/828-2
02:38:24.104 --> 02:38:26.585
<v Marwan Altaie>whether there's any additional tweaks.
This isn't set in stone,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/828-3
02:38:26.585 --> 02:38:28.988
<v Marwan Altaie>but it's it's good.
We've had that discussion and the draught</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/828-4
02:38:28.988 --> 02:38:30.577
<v Marwan Altaie>invoices has come up. Thank you for that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/829-0
02:38:32.537 --> 02:38:36.691
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool. So next one is bad debt.
Write off again. Just the process I used.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/829-1
02:38:36.691 --> 02:38:40.845
<v Marwan Altaie>There were a couple process discrepancies.
I think I checked the folder.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/829-2
02:38:40.845 --> 02:38:43.349
<v Marwan Altaie>There were a couple changes in the
numbers,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/829-3
02:38:43.349 --> 02:38:47.617
<v Marwan Altaie>so if it doesn't align with the
expectations, we'll make that change. But.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/830-0
02:38:47.977 --> 02:38:52.399
<v Marwan Altaie>Hopefully for the most part,
the rest of the process should align,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/830-1
02:38:52.399 --> 02:38:56.886
<v Marwan Altaie>so this is a dead deemed uncollectible
and needs to be written off.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/830-2
02:38:56.886 --> 02:39:00.846
<v Marwan Altaie>So is that for this or? Yeah,
it's all good. No, it's fine.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/830-3
02:39:00.846 --> 02:39:05.927
<v Marwan Altaie>Is is there something that we need to
tweak or no, no, no, I I the bad debt,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/830-4
02:39:05.927 --> 02:39:07.577
<v Marwan Altaie>right. I forget and this.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/831-0
02:39:07.617 --> 02:39:11.060
<v Marwan Altaie>This is a process that is,
we're changing and making it as is</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/831-1
02:39:11.060 --> 02:39:14.225
<v Marwan Altaie>process is consistent.
So this is another one that we're</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/831-2
02:39:14.225 --> 02:39:17.112
<v Marwan Altaie>changing.
I had pre empted the changes for this and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/831-3
02:39:17.112 --> 02:39:20.555
<v Marwan Altaie>and it's just given me the Australian
approval of of perfect.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/831-4
02:39:20.555 --> 02:39:24.497
<v Marwan Altaie>I noticed not not in writing but
globalised. We can make some of this.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/832-0
02:39:24.777 --> 02:39:29.596
<v Marwan Altaie>Process like one global process rather
than probably the multiple process maps</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/832-1
02:39:29.596 --> 02:39:34.293
<v Marwan Altaie>that you did have that makes it easier
for me, so no issues with that. Cool.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/832-2
02:39:34.293 --> 02:39:38.441
<v Marwan Altaie>So yeah, bad debt write off the process.
Credit control partner PE,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/832-3
02:39:38.441 --> 02:39:42.101
<v Marwan Altaie>business manager.
There were quite a few people that seemed</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/832-4
02:39:42.101 --> 02:39:44.297
<v Marwan Altaie>could raise and kick this off which.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/833-0
02:39:44.497 --> 02:39:48.371
<v Marwan Altaie>And it makes it hard to lock down who can
raise it. If we start doing forms,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/833-1
02:39:48.371 --> 02:39:50.786
<v Marwan Altaie>but that's not an issue.
The credit management,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/833-2
02:39:50.786 --> 02:39:54.660
<v Marwan Altaie>so credit manager or the working capital
manager reviews routes the relevant</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/833-3
02:39:54.660 --> 02:39:57.578
<v Marwan Altaie>approval thresholds.
I have a slide later on that kind of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/833-4
02:39:57.578 --> 02:40:00.898
<v Marwan Altaie>defines what the different thresholds are.
But within ServiceNow,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/833-5
02:40:00.898 --> 02:40:04.017
<v Marwan Altaie>it would just be if over 100 lbs sent to
experts and if over.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/834-0
02:40:04.097 --> 02:40:06.716
<v Marwan Altaie>300 uh,
pretty much in line with that and it goes</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/834-1
02:40:06.716 --> 02:40:09.701
<v Marwan Altaie>through. Yeah,
threshold approvers approve or reject and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/834-2
02:40:09.701 --> 02:40:12.057
<v Marwan Altaie>then uh credit management complete in
three.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/835-0
02:40:14.457 --> 02:40:14.577
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/836-0
02:40:16.377 --> 02:40:19.667
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that fine for Australia as well? Yeah.
Yeah, I think so. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/836-1
02:40:19.667 --> 02:40:23.454
<v Marwan Altaie>that's this is a bit we're changing
because currently it's done by cashiers</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/836-2
02:40:23.454 --> 02:40:25.797
<v Marwan Altaie>in Australia,
they do the processing in three.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/836-3
02:40:25.797 --> 02:40:29.585
<v Marwan Altaie>So I'd like to bring it to the credit
control team and this is what Stephen</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/836-4
02:40:29.585 --> 02:40:31.977
<v Marwan Altaie>does in, in for Europe, Middle East,
US and UK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/837-0
02:40:32.817 --> 02:40:34.537
<v Marwan Altaie>So we're standardising that cool.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/838-0
02:40:37.697 --> 02:40:42.440
<v Marwan Altaie>The decision, just approval,
rejects approvals are as you can see</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/838-1
02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:45.890
<v Marwan Altaie>there.
So I've taken that from the process map.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/838-2
02:40:45.890 --> 02:40:50.130
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that correct?
You read it instead of going through each</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/838-3
02:40:50.130 --> 02:40:50.417
<v Marwan Altaie>one.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/839-0
02:40:51.817 --> 02:40:52.057
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/840-0
02:40:53.937 --> 02:40:59.114
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, they ask,
we've got 100 to 10K matter partner and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/840-1
02:40:59.114 --> 02:41:06.325
<v Marwan Altaie>then we've got 10K to 50K practise head.
What if it's 10K? Who does it go to?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/840-2
02:41:06.325 --> 02:41:10.577
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it 9999? Again, don't mind.
Good question.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/841-0
02:41:12.337 --> 02:41:16.944
<v Marwan Altaie>Let's say 9999.99 can go to matter.
Partner. Yeah, OK. And then 10K and above.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/841-1
02:41:16.944 --> 02:41:19.860
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. I mean,
how did the how the thresholds done</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/841-2
02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:22.017
<v Marwan Altaie>elsewhere, what they do, what you do?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/842-0
02:41:25.017 --> 02:41:29.522
<v Marwan Altaie>Early approvals, you know,
ours is pretty or ours goes up to 10K and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/842-1
02:41:29.522 --> 02:41:32.983
<v Marwan Altaie>then 10,000 and one, OK, well,
we should batch that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/842-2
02:41:32.983 --> 02:41:36.574
<v Marwan Altaie>That's my effort system. Yeah,
that sounds more. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/842-3
02:41:36.574 --> 02:41:39.577
<v Marwan Altaie>OK what do we what do you do if there's
like?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/843-0
02:41:39.977 --> 02:41:42.639
<v Marwan Altaie>A Tony Damian,
whose partner and practise head the scene</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/843-1
02:41:42.639 --> 02:41:46.235
<v Marwan Altaie>is he fine to do up to 50K? Yeah. 'cause.
He's practise said he could do so.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/843-2
02:41:46.235 --> 02:41:49.037
<v Marwan Altaie>He can do that? Yeah.
Sometimes you're practise head of all</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/843-3
02:41:49.037 --> 02:41:49.457
<v Marwan Altaie>accounts.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/844-0
02:41:53.417 --> 02:41:57.559
<v Marwan Altaie>Thanks for that, Tim.
I remember my math teacher always used to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/844-1
02:41:57.559 --> 02:42:01.442
<v Marwan Altaie>pull me up on that. So.
So it's a good point back in school</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/844-2
02:42:01.442 --> 02:42:04.548
<v Marwan Altaie>anyway.
I'm that so that's that's good that the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/844-3
02:42:04.548 --> 02:42:07.137
<v Marwan Altaie>thresholds align. I'll make that change.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/845-0
02:42:09.377 --> 02:42:13.344
<v Marwan Altaie>So we'll go through the questions,
same structure as the last one.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/845-1
02:42:13.344 --> 02:42:16.601
<v Marwan Altaie>So who can raise?
We said that is in line that we have</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/845-2
02:42:16.601 --> 02:42:20.094
<v Marwan Altaie>multiple razors.
Do we want within ServiceNow to keep that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/845-3
02:42:20.094 --> 02:42:24.535
<v Marwan Altaie>open to whoever has access and is in
these groups or do we want to lock it</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/845-4
02:42:24.535 --> 02:42:25.897
<v Marwan Altaie>down to specific users?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/846-0
02:42:26.217 --> 02:42:28.537
<v Marwan Altaie>To route it through the system or what
would your preference be?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/847-0
02:42:30.817 --> 02:42:32.177
<v Marwan Altaie>Who could raise the request?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/848-0
02:42:34.497 --> 02:42:36.875
<v Marwan Altaie>No, potentially.
Anyone who raised your request. It's not.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/848-1
02:42:36.875 --> 02:42:38.769
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah,
there's no as long as long as they're in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/848-2
02:42:38.769 --> 02:42:39.857
<v Marwan Altaie>these groups, they're fine.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/849-0
02:42:43.257 --> 02:42:47.068
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, I mean, yeah,
but potentially that's the business.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/849-1
02:42:47.068 --> 02:42:51.948
<v Marwan Altaie>Basically most of the partners,
bees business managers go to controllers</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/849-2
02:42:51.948 --> 02:42:55.290
<v Marwan Altaie>probably, yeah, no. Well,
you can if you want to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/849-3
02:42:55.290 --> 02:42:57.897
<v Marwan Altaie>Any anyone else would seem a bit fishy.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/850-0
02:42:58.217 --> 02:43:01.807
<v Marwan Altaie>So like if Tim's sending off a bad debt
write off. He's like what?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/850-1
02:43:01.807 --> 02:43:03.897
<v Marwan Altaie>What dinners have you been out to, Tim?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/851-0
02:43:06.297 --> 02:43:11.115
<v Marwan Altaie>So it will be searchable I suppose if
it's open to everyone. So for example,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/851-1
02:43:11.115 --> 02:43:15.869
<v Marwan Altaie>I know only certain people will use bad
debt right as a freeze or whatever,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/851-2
02:43:15.869 --> 02:43:20.624
<v Marwan Altaie>but it's just you can walk it down to if
you open requests, no to raise it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/851-3
02:43:20.624 --> 02:43:25.317
<v Marwan Altaie>you're all right there. Absolutely.
You guys think he's opened you up with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/851-4
02:43:25.317 --> 02:43:25.817
<v Marwan Altaie>traffic?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/852-0
02:43:25.897 --> 02:43:30.649
<v Marwan Altaie>They shouldn't even be there, right?
And can it come from other finance teams?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/852-1
02:43:30.649 --> 02:43:34.017
<v Marwan Altaie>The request,
or does it always have to go through here?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/853-0
02:43:35.377 --> 02:43:39.417
<v Marwan Altaie>They would, with the never seen them. OK,
that's fine. You might get it from a.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/854-0
02:43:41.657 --> 02:43:45.828
<v Marwan Altaie>Like from one of the finance offices like
Germany, for example.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/854-1
02:43:45.828 --> 02:43:49.152
<v Marwan Altaie>Actually by saying something to them,
maybe. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/854-2
02:43:49.152 --> 02:43:54.496
<v Marwan Altaie>that depending on the value that Patrick
would still need authority from partner.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/854-3
02:43:54.496 --> 02:43:58.471
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. For example,
we've got the ones just know for ISG that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/854-4
02:43:58.471 --> 02:44:00.817
<v Marwan Altaie>have been discussed several 100,000.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/855-0
02:44:01.057 --> 02:44:04.224
<v Marwan Altaie>And EUR now Patrick's reviewing those at
the moment,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/855-1
02:44:04.224 --> 02:44:06.854
<v Marwan Altaie>but it's going to have to come from
Martin.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/855-2
02:44:06.854 --> 02:44:11.515
<v Marwan Altaie>You know the actual written request that
will then have to follow the process</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/855-3
02:44:11.515 --> 02:44:15.937
<v Marwan Altaie>through to CFO to then come back down to
myself to process the right off.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/856-0
02:44:17.137 --> 02:44:19.057
<v Marwan Altaie>That's a really good question occurred to
me.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/857-0
02:44:20.457 --> 02:44:23.472
<v Marwan Altaie>If, for example,
I let's just say that while Stephen's</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/857-1
02:44:23.472 --> 02:44:27.200
<v Marwan Altaie>talking about this example,
so we have a German partner who's got a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/857-2
02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:31.585
<v Marwan Altaie>very large debt that needs to be approved
to written after he's approved by our</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/857-3
02:44:31.585 --> 02:44:35.697
<v Marwan Altaie>Global CFO. Supposing the request,
I think what our Patrick and our German</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/857-4
02:44:35.697 --> 02:44:38.657
<v Marwan Altaie>finance team goes to mark directly gets
his approval.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/858-0
02:44:39.417 --> 02:44:43.078
<v Marwan Altaie>And then once it processed,
does he just raise the request with the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/858-1
02:44:43.078 --> 02:44:46.686
<v Marwan Altaie>approval attached just attached?
That was just going to be my next</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/858-2
02:44:46.686 --> 02:44:49.755
<v Marwan Altaie>question, right?
So do we want to be in a position where</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/858-3
02:44:49.755 --> 02:44:53.739
<v Marwan Altaie>if whoever is raising the bad date
request has to provide the approval at</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/858-4
02:44:53.739 --> 02:44:54.977
<v Marwan Altaie>the time of raising it?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/859-0
02:44:55.417 --> 02:44:59.417
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm assuming it comes in e-mail so they
can attach that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/860-0
02:44:59.577 --> 02:44:59.697
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/861-0
02:45:01.057 --> 02:45:04.149
<v Marwan Altaie>That's what we need to say.
If we don't get it in that format with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/861-1
02:45:04.149 --> 02:45:07.149
<v Marwan Altaie>those approvals, then it would,
it would be passed back with the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/861-2
02:45:07.149 --> 02:45:09.965
<v Marwan Altaie>instruction about who needs to do.
I go out to get approval.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/861-3
02:45:09.965 --> 02:45:13.611
<v Marwan Altaie>A lot of people because a partner will
say to me I want to write this debt off</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/861-4
02:45:13.611 --> 02:45:15.457
<v Marwan Altaie>Bristol. I'm like all right, no worries.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/863-0
02:45:15.897 --> 02:45:18.732
<v Marwan Altaie>It's over 250 cab when I have to wait to
speak to Mark,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/863-1
02:45:18.732 --> 02:45:21.768
<v Marwan Altaie>and then I will go over to Mark to go and
get his approval.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/863-2
02:45:21.768 --> 02:45:25.716
<v Marwan Altaie>The partners don't necessarily go and get
the approval they do in some cases,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/863-3
02:45:25.716 --> 02:45:28.045
<v Marwan Altaie>but some they don't.
So it's a good question.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/863-4
02:45:28.045 --> 02:45:31.537
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we make them go out and get it? No, no,
probably not. I wouldn't.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/864-0
02:45:33.297 --> 02:45:37.471
<v Marwan Altaie>What I'm trying to think of is,
is the rules then based on which role you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/864-1
02:45:37.471 --> 02:45:37.697
<v Marwan Altaie>are.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/865-0
02:45:40.257 --> 02:45:44.400
<v Marwan Altaie>You make an exception to the rule for
just this, just this one partner,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/865-1
02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:46.931
<v Marwan Altaie>one finance manager in Germany,
that Chris,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/865-2
02:45:46.931 --> 02:45:51.764
<v Marwan Altaie>you could then give him an instruction to
attach the approval and just put that the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/865-3
02:45:51.764 --> 02:45:55.504
<v Marwan Altaie>width is under 100 lbs.
So it comes to you automatically and you</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/865-4
02:45:55.504 --> 02:45:56.137
<v Marwan Altaie>can do the.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/866-0
02:45:56.577 --> 02:46:02.652
<v Marwan Altaie>Review yourself as much as obviously you
don't want to have to do an exception to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/866-1
02:46:02.652 --> 02:46:07.616
<v Marwan Altaie>the rule. A request comes in.
Just think of the logic that request</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/866-2
02:46:07.616 --> 02:46:11.617
<v Marwan Altaie>comes in to made by whoever it is,
OK and should the.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/867-0
02:46:14.457 --> 02:46:18.361
<v Marwan Altaie>Can I receive a request? Well, see,
we want to buy and look at it and say, OK,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/867-1
02:46:18.361 --> 02:46:20.930
<v Marwan Altaie>the approval's attached.
We don't do anything else.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/867-2
02:46:20.930 --> 02:46:23.648
<v Marwan Altaie>We'll just process it or it's not
received. Therefore,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/867-3
02:46:23.648 --> 02:46:25.822
<v Marwan Altaie>we've got to route it towards the
approval.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/867-4
02:46:25.822 --> 02:46:29.429
<v Marwan Altaie>Can we select that at the time of
receiving the request or do we need to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/867-5
02:46:29.429 --> 02:46:31.257
<v Marwan Altaie>have a set rule that says you either?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/868-0
02:46:32.257 --> 02:46:36.517
<v Marwan Altaie>Go out to get the request beforehand and
then you submit the request in ServiceNow.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/868-1
02:46:36.517 --> 02:46:38.748
<v Marwan Altaie>No,
you don't need to force them to provide</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/868-2
02:46:38.748 --> 02:46:41.436
<v Marwan Altaie>the approval.
It's just obviously to reduce traffic.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/868-3
02:46:41.436 --> 02:46:43.920
<v Marwan Altaie>That's what we're trying to achieve here,
right?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/868-4
02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:47.977
<v Marwan Altaie>So if there are certain people that can
raise the task but they're not in that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/869-0
02:46:48.697 --> 02:46:53.077
<v Marwan Altaie>100 to 10 grand or whatever group because
they're asking for a date right off.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/869-1
02:46:53.077 --> 02:46:56.514
<v Marwan Altaie>It's higher than that.
We can either ask them to provide that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/869-2
02:46:56.514 --> 02:47:01.004
<v Marwan Altaie>approval up upfront if they've had those
conversations or it comes in and that's</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/869-3
02:47:01.004 --> 02:47:03.721
<v Marwan Altaie>your step,
you go out and you get that approval.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/869-4
02:47:03.721 --> 02:47:06.548
<v Marwan Altaie>So you can leave it.
You don't have to force them.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/869-5
02:47:06.548 --> 02:47:07.657
<v Marwan Altaie>It's just to reduce.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/870-0
02:47:08.377 --> 02:47:11.386
<v Marwan Altaie>I think a good way of doing it. Yeah,
that's fine. Yeah. Look,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/870-1
02:47:11.386 --> 02:47:13.964
<v Marwan Altaie>we don't have these are not.
We're not talking a lot.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/870-2
02:47:13.964 --> 02:47:16.591
<v Marwan Altaie>We have bad desks.
We don't have hundreds every month.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/870-3
02:47:16.591 --> 02:47:20.459
<v Marwan Altaie>Hopefully as few as possible. So just,
just in terms of asking for that approval</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/870-4
02:47:20.459 --> 02:47:22.894
<v Marwan Altaie>upfront.
Is that just because of the way that they</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/870-5
02:47:22.894 --> 02:47:23.897
<v Marwan Altaie>work or is that just?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/871-0
02:47:24.377 --> 02:47:27.547
<v Marwan Altaie>It caused more slowdown in trying to get
that process for it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/871-1
02:47:27.547 --> 02:47:30.666
<v Marwan Altaie>It causes more slowdown,
but there's also sometimes separate</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/871-2
02:47:30.666 --> 02:47:34.246
<v Marwan Altaie>conversations need to be had,
so a partner for example may say I want</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/871-3
02:47:34.246 --> 02:47:38.081
<v Marwan Altaie>to write off my debt on this matter and
we might have to have a commercial</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/871-4
02:47:38.081 --> 02:47:40.177
<v Marwan Altaie>discussion away from that partner to say.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/872-0
02:47:40.977 --> 02:47:44.297
<v Marwan Altaie>We're not writing off that debt.
The clients X amount of millions. Another.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/872-1
02:47:44.297 --> 02:47:47.006
<v Marwan Altaie>You're keeping it.
You're ready keeping it. And that's great,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/872-2
02:47:47.006 --> 02:47:50.544
<v Marwan Altaie>mark. And I would step in and say, yeah,
so we would need to control that to say</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/872-3
02:47:50.544 --> 02:47:54.257
<v Marwan Altaie>no. So that's why I was asking about that.
Do we need the approval first or not kind</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/872-4
02:47:54.257 --> 02:47:57.315
<v Marwan Altaie>of having the options really good because
then if we've got it great,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/872-5
02:47:57.315 --> 02:48:00.417
<v Marwan Altaie>that saves me doing it and we can make a
decision. If they don't then.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/873-0
02:48:00.497 --> 02:48:04.063
<v Marwan Altaie>And a conversation needs to be had.
We can go and have that conversation and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/873-1
02:48:04.063 --> 02:48:07.165
<v Marwan Altaie>then take it back. So I hope that's cool.
Yeah. It's on the micro.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/873-2
02:48:07.165 --> 02:48:10.638
<v Marwan Altaie>That is it worth within ServiceNow?
Having all of these different approval</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/873-3
02:48:10.638 --> 02:48:14.435
<v Marwan Altaie>levels and all of these different users
or would it be more efficient to identify</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/873-4
02:48:14.435 --> 02:48:17.028
<v Marwan Altaie>one or two like the credit control
manager for example,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/873-5
02:48:17.028 --> 02:48:20.177
<v Marwan Altaie>to do those approvals and assume that
they go off and get whatever?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/874-0
02:48:20.577 --> 02:48:21.737
<v Marwan Altaie>Threshold approvals we need.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/875-0
02:48:24.377 --> 02:48:27.919
<v Marwan Altaie>So rather than it automatically roots,
so rather than me getting a request in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/875-1
02:48:27.919 --> 02:48:31.687
<v Marwan Altaie>that doesn't have approval and me saying
that needs to be approved and it goes off</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/875-2
02:48:31.687 --> 02:48:34.275
<v Marwan Altaie>to practise head,
you're saying I manually just say this</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/875-3
02:48:34.275 --> 02:48:37.771
<v Marwan Altaie>needs to be practise and I'll send it
myself and instead of multiple cheques</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/875-4
02:48:37.771 --> 02:48:41.222
<v Marwan Altaie>you just have one check which is your
whoever you want to allocate whatever</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/875-5
02:48:41.222 --> 02:48:43.537
<v Marwan Altaie>team you want to allocate and assume that
they've.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/876-0
02:48:43.897 --> 02:48:45.777
<v Marwan Altaie>On the due diligence and the cheques.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/877-0
02:48:50.537 --> 02:48:54.610
<v Marwan Altaie>I think there's maybe more bespoke
reasons as to why you need to go and get</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/877-1
02:48:54.610 --> 02:48:57.557
<v Marwan Altaie>the approval,
and you won't necessarily always go back</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/877-2
02:48:57.557 --> 02:49:01.255
<v Marwan Altaie>to the requester to do that,
or you probably won't even do that when</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/877-3
02:49:01.255 --> 02:49:04.095
<v Marwan Altaie>it comes in.
The team is hearing you would just take</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/877-4
02:49:04.095 --> 02:49:08.060
<v Marwan Altaie>that action. Yeah, I think leave it open.
So I think we'll leave it open.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/877-5
02:49:08.060 --> 02:49:10.257
<v Marwan Altaie>I think it's just they've got the option.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/878-0
02:49:10.457 --> 02:49:13.997
<v Marwan Altaie>To put the approval piece onto the
workflow if they need to. OK fine. OK,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/878-1
02:49:13.997 --> 02:49:17.537
<v Marwan Altaie>once we come to solution design further
down the line, we can discuss it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/878-2
02:49:17.537 --> 02:49:19.977
<v Marwan Altaie>but it's just good to know what the
preference is.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/880-0
02:49:24.817 --> 02:49:28.667
<v Marwan Altaie>Hey, yeah,
decisions just approve or reject the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/880-1
02:49:28.667 --> 02:49:34.523
<v Marwan Altaie>routing is or razor. Like we said,
your working capital capital manager,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/880-2
02:49:34.523 --> 02:49:39.737
<v Marwan Altaie>threshold Approvers and then it's action
by the credit managers.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/881-0
02:49:40.177 --> 02:49:44.596
<v Marwan Altaie>Or credit management or the working
Capital Management approvals.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/881-1
02:49:44.596 --> 02:49:48.679
<v Marwan Altaie>We set thresholds, who finishes, process,
credit management,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/881-2
02:49:48.679 --> 02:49:51.759
<v Marwan Altaie>evidence on closure similar to the other
one.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/881-3
02:49:51.759 --> 02:49:56.177
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we need it or well that's an
interesting one. So we currently.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/882-0
02:49:57.257 --> 02:50:00.663
<v Marwan Altaie>When we get approvals by e-mail,
when you process them in three E,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/882-1
02:50:00.663 --> 02:50:04.171
<v Marwan Altaie>you have to you add an attachment into 3
E so you get your approval,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/882-2
02:50:04.171 --> 02:50:08.239
<v Marwan Altaie>you attach it to the transaction in 3E
because you write it off in 3 E and then</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/882-3
02:50:08.239 --> 02:50:12.255
<v Marwan Altaie>there's an attachment field you drag in
the attachment and have it on there so</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/882-4
02:50:12.255 --> 02:50:16.017
<v Marwan Altaie>that when the auditors come in and say,
Chris, why do you write off that?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/883-0
02:50:16.497 --> 02:50:18.718
<v Marwan Altaie>Here's the transaction 3.
Here's the posting details and look at</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/883-1
02:50:18.718 --> 02:50:20.017
<v Marwan Altaie>the attachment. There's your approval.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/884-0
02:50:21.737 --> 02:50:24.777
<v Marwan Altaie>Is it worth bringing that into service
now as well?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/885-0
02:50:27.617 --> 02:50:32.103
<v Marwan Altaie>Don't know if you want to fully audit the
board and service now and have that kind</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/885-1
02:50:32.103 --> 02:50:35.021
<v Marwan Altaie>of end to end.
It's worth it if it's adding more work</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/885-2
02:50:35.021 --> 02:50:38.804
<v Marwan Altaie>and probably raise questions,
but in order for when the audience come</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/885-3
02:50:38.804 --> 02:50:41.723
<v Marwan Altaie>in actually have to show them the
transaction. Three,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/885-4
02:50:41.723 --> 02:50:45.938
<v Marwan Altaie>I have to sit there and show them the
screen so they can still GL posting the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/885-5
02:50:45.938 --> 02:50:46.857
<v Marwan Altaie>bad debt posting.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/886-0
02:50:47.057 --> 02:50:49.724
<v Marwan Altaie>See posting,
they actually want to see the physical</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/886-1
02:50:49.724 --> 02:50:52.903
<v Marwan Altaie>transaction in three,
and that's what I like have to share my</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/886-2
02:50:52.903 --> 02:50:56.031
<v Marwan Altaie>screen with them and say, look,
I did it on that date. Look,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/886-3
02:50:56.031 --> 02:50:59.108
<v Marwan Altaie>there's my attachment.
I'm just trying to think is it worth</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/886-4
02:50:59.108 --> 02:51:03.415
<v Marwan Altaie>putting that proof in three in ServiceNow
is that simple as you have to do drag and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/886-5
02:51:03.415 --> 02:51:05.569
<v Marwan Altaie>drop.
I'll just screenshot is literally a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/886-6
02:51:05.569 --> 02:51:06.697
<v Marwan Altaie>screenshot attachment.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/887-0
02:51:06.777 --> 02:51:08.097
<v Marwan Altaie>The approval, yeah, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/888-0
02:51:09.857 --> 02:51:13.097
<v Marwan Altaie>It would be a manual step I suppose,
though. Yeah, yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/888-1
02:51:13.097 --> 02:51:16.450
<v Marwan Altaie>it's just a drag and drop.
I'm assuming it's just a. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/888-2
02:51:16.450 --> 02:51:20.656
<v Marwan Altaie>the sake of three seconds. I mean,
the approvals that we're getting here,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/888-3
02:51:20.656 --> 02:51:25.089
<v Marwan Altaie>do they also need to be in three as well?
Because if we're running it through</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/888-4
02:51:25.089 --> 02:51:28.101
<v Marwan Altaie>ServiceNow,
we're going to have that approval record</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/888-5
02:51:28.101 --> 02:51:28.897
<v Marwan Altaie>in ServiceNow.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/889-0
02:51:29.257 --> 02:51:33.007
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we need to grab a screenshot of that
and then put it into 33A for audit</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/889-1
02:51:33.007 --> 02:51:33.457
<v Marwan Altaie>purposes?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/890-0
02:51:37.257 --> 02:51:40.718
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes you would do.
We need to attach some kind of proof into</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/890-1
02:51:40.718 --> 02:51:44.641
<v Marwan Altaie>3 E that's what we currently do.
We have to have proof of authorise</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/890-2
02:51:44.641 --> 02:51:49.140
<v Marwan Altaie>authorization that you've written that
debt off in against the transaction in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/890-3
02:51:49.140 --> 02:51:52.428
<v Marwan Altaie>three. Now, yes,
that could potentially help the service</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/890-4
02:51:52.428 --> 02:51:53.697
<v Marwan Altaie>now, no reason not to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/891-0
02:51:55.017 --> 02:51:58.819
<v Marwan Altaie>Instead of three,
but you still have to show it over to the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/891-1
02:51:58.819 --> 02:52:02.177
<v Marwan Altaie>transaction 3.
So where do we want the source of the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/891-2
02:52:02.177 --> 02:52:02.937
<v Marwan Altaie>truth to be?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/892-0
02:52:05.937 --> 02:52:06.137
<v Marwan Altaie>3.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/893-0
02:52:08.137 --> 02:52:11.337
<v Marwan Altaie>I think that should answer yeah. OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/894-0
02:52:14.057 --> 02:52:17.387
<v Marwan Altaie>So does that mean we're not going to get
approvals via ServiceNow?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/894-1
02:52:17.387 --> 02:52:20.717
<v Marwan Altaie>We're going to have to get,
we might get approvals via ServiceNow,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/894-2
02:52:20.717 --> 02:52:24.146
<v Marwan Altaie>but we might have to surface the
ServiceNow approval in three. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/894-3
02:52:24.146 --> 02:52:27.575
<v Marwan Altaie>that's that's what happens just now
because you get e-mail approval,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/894-4
02:52:27.575 --> 02:52:30.457
<v Marwan Altaie>don't you? Yeah. Yeah. So all the emails.
Yeah. OK. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/895-0
02:52:31.057 --> 02:52:35.374
<v Marwan Altaie>So we there's no reason we couldn't
attach a I'm assuming there's some kind</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/895-1
02:52:35.374 --> 02:52:37.987
<v Marwan Altaie>of like,
you know screen to say so and so has</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/895-2
02:52:37.987 --> 02:52:42.532
<v Marwan Altaie>approved this with a date and a time and
stamp or something copy and paste that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/895-3
02:52:42.532 --> 02:52:45.599
<v Marwan Altaie>into three-week.
So ServiceNow has records of all the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/895-4
02:52:45.599 --> 02:52:48.553
<v Marwan Altaie>approvals.
All the routing generally on the tickets</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/895-5
02:52:48.553 --> 02:52:50.257
<v Marwan Altaie>that's easy to screenshot and.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/896-0
02:52:50.657 --> 02:52:56.412
<v Marwan Altaie>And then just attach that ticket the
moment you do it from the e-mail. OK,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/896-1
02:52:56.412 --> 02:53:02.243
<v Marwan Altaie>so it's the same process then, yeah,
because you it sounds like it was both</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/896-2
02:53:02.243 --> 02:53:07.537
<v Marwan Altaie>free and also it's nice to try. Yeah.
Chris, in your work like your.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/897-0
02:53:09.057 --> 02:53:14.181
<v Marwan Altaie>In three A is there a form that you do to
write down the jet? What is it receipt?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/897-1
02:53:14.181 --> 02:53:18.555
<v Marwan Altaie>Add this to receipt. OK, Jen,
if in a lot of forms in three a there's</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/897-2
02:53:18.555 --> 02:53:23.617
<v Marwan Altaie>an attachment. Yeah. So that's where we.
So yeah. So you can literally just put.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/898-0
02:53:23.977 --> 02:53:27.586
<v Marwan Altaie>The ServiceNow ticket reference in there
as text. If you want,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/898-1
02:53:27.586 --> 02:53:31.481
<v Marwan Altaie>you can refer back to it because we do
that a lot for AP stuff, OK,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/898-2
02:53:31.481 --> 02:53:34.689
<v Marwan Altaie>just an option rather than having to
attach everything,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/898-3
02:53:34.689 --> 02:53:37.611
<v Marwan Altaie>you can then put in just the ServiceNow
reference.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/898-4
02:53:37.611 --> 02:53:41.621
<v Marwan Altaie>There'll be a lot of other teams around
finance doing the same thing.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/898-5
02:53:41.621 --> 02:53:42.537
<v Marwan Altaie>So you can just.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/899-0
02:53:43.377 --> 02:53:46.137
<v Marwan Altaie>Look at that text and reference back all
of the evidence.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/899-1
02:53:46.137 --> 02:53:49.610
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's kind of in two places at once
without being in two places. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/899-2
02:53:49.610 --> 02:53:52.228
<v Marwan Altaie>that's a good shout. Yeah.
If you've got reference ID,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/899-3
02:53:52.228 --> 02:53:53.417
<v Marwan Altaie>that'll be really useful.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/900-0
02:53:58.017 --> 02:54:01.986
<v Marwan Altaie>Can I just ask?
I don't know what you're talking about,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/900-1
02:54:01.986 --> 02:54:07.870
<v Marwan Altaie>and because of the debt certification at
the moment that is done via e-mail or via</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/900-2
02:54:07.870 --> 02:54:11.697
<v Marwan Altaie>conversation debt certification,
it's done by e-mail.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/901-0
02:54:13.457 --> 02:54:16.704
<v Marwan Altaie>So OK,
I didn't even think of debt certification</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/901-1
02:54:16.704 --> 02:54:20.414
<v Marwan Altaie>for this, but now you've mentioned it.
So what is debt?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/901-2
02:54:20.414 --> 02:54:25.184
<v Marwan Altaie>I've I've moved one step forward,
not printed anywhere under any. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/901-3
02:54:25.184 --> 02:54:28.497
<v Marwan Altaie>this is a whole,
but we would anywhere if it was.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/902-0
02:54:29.217 --> 02:54:35.330
<v Marwan Altaie>Done via this you could run a report to
see how many partners have completed.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/902-1
02:54:35.330 --> 02:54:41.756
<v Marwan Altaie>It could be you could be documenting that
the value etcetera etcetera because the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/902-2
02:54:41.756 --> 02:54:46.537
<v Marwan Altaie>process doesn't necessarily actually
officially sit and ask.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/903-0
02:54:47.137 --> 02:54:51.583
<v Marwan Altaie>It's run by the accountants,
so Nick Lewis and and Christine and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/903-1
02:54:51.583 --> 02:54:55.756
<v Marwan Altaie>Rachel, they run the process.
But I do a debtors part of it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/903-2
02:54:55.756 --> 02:55:00.955
<v Marwan Altaie>so it's not attached to bad debt.
It's completely separate. Yeah, but it's.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/903-3
02:55:00.955 --> 02:55:01.297
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/905-0
02:55:02.057 --> 02:55:06.233
<v Marwan Altaie>It's basically saying we've got XYZ bills
that are outstanding.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/905-1
02:55:06.233 --> 02:55:10.474
<v Marwan Altaie>Are they really outstanding?
Do we have to write any of them off</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/905-2
02:55:10.474 --> 02:55:15.955
<v Marwan Altaie>because we're never going to get paid for
them and cancel on that evaluation piece.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/905-3
02:55:15.955 --> 02:55:20.457
<v Marwan Altaie>I spoke about the whip earlier.
It's similar on the debt side, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/906-0
02:55:20.777 --> 02:55:24.488
<v Marwan Altaie>So every six months we send emails out to
all our partners and say you've got this</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/906-1
02:55:24.488 --> 02:55:26.590
<v Marwan Altaie>amount of debt,
actually what's actually real,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/906-2
02:55:26.590 --> 02:55:29.094
<v Marwan Altaie>like what's rubbish,
what's real and who reports on it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/906-3
02:55:29.094 --> 02:55:32.849
<v Marwan Altaie>Do you report on it or is it the finance
team, the finance team, the data for them,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/906-4
02:55:32.849 --> 02:55:36.382
<v Marwan Altaie>review it, make sure it looks the right.
And then I sent it up to the account.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/906-5
02:55:36.382 --> 02:55:38.617
<v Marwan Altaie>It was just because you were talking
about. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/907-0
02:55:39.137 --> 02:55:42.448
<v Marwan Altaie>Posting stuff that made me think about
date certification. OK,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/907-1
02:55:42.448 --> 02:55:46.494
<v Marwan Altaie>you probably need some way to track the
work that's been sent into the team,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/907-2
02:55:46.494 --> 02:55:49.069
<v Marwan Altaie>though.
You probably want to have a press coming</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/907-3
02:55:49.069 --> 02:55:52.274
<v Marwan Altaie>into the to the teams,
then look at those certifications and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/907-4
02:55:52.274 --> 02:55:52.537
<v Marwan Altaie>then.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/908-0
02:55:54.977 --> 02:55:58.154
<v Marwan Altaie>Closing it off.
This is so when you come and do that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/908-1
02:55:58.154 --> 02:56:01.030
<v Marwan Altaie>report,
you basically want a template that goes</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/908-2
02:56:01.030 --> 02:56:03.967
<v Marwan Altaie>out to all your partners to see.
Check all this,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/908-3
02:56:03.967 --> 02:56:07.983
<v Marwan Altaie>all the replies will come into the system.
You can report on them.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/908-4
02:56:07.983 --> 02:56:12.718
<v Marwan Altaie>I just bring the account that said that
we Nick was online before I could dial</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/908-5
02:56:12.718 --> 02:56:13.137
<v Marwan Altaie>her in.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/909-0
02:56:13.337 --> 02:56:17.041
<v Marwan Altaie>To the moon, can we just? Could we just?
I think we just put it in a parking lot</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/909-1
02:56:17.041 --> 02:56:20.060
<v Marwan Altaie>because we'll need to. This.
This has a only explore the process.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/909-2
02:56:20.060 --> 02:56:23.581
<v Marwan Altaie>This is documented. Yeah. It's not.
And it's not an ask process which is why</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/909-3
02:56:23.581 --> 02:56:25.776
<v Marwan Altaie>it's not.
It's kind of like sits you catch that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/909-4
02:56:25.776 --> 02:56:27.377
<v Marwan Altaie>Isabella just to document it. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/910-0
02:56:28.617 --> 02:56:29.137
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, cool.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/912-0
02:56:31.617 --> 02:56:35.941
<v Marwan Altaie>That's a lot of complaints come from that
process for the business a lot.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/912-1
02:56:35.941 --> 02:56:40.615
<v Marwan Altaie>We we could find a good way of doing it.
It would be game changing cool. Sorry.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/912-2
02:56:40.615 --> 02:56:44.412
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry twilight. Sorry.
We just always rely on one to come in and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/912-3
02:56:44.412 --> 02:56:46.457
<v Marwan Altaie>just go and then quarter off again.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/913-0
02:56:48.617 --> 02:56:50.865
<v Marwan Altaie>Just keep an eye out when she's next to
the room.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/913-1
02:56:50.865 --> 02:56:54.146
<v Marwan Altaie>So I'm not going to get into too much
detail, but just out of curiosity,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/913-2
02:56:54.146 --> 02:56:57.698
<v Marwan Altaie>are we saying that the bad debt write off
is something that triggers this debt</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/913-3
02:56:57.698 --> 02:57:00.125
<v Marwan Altaie>certification? No, I see it's a different.
Excellent.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/913-4
02:57:00.125 --> 02:57:03.047
<v Marwan Altaie>Dean would have just seen bad debt and
thoughts about certified.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/913-5
02:57:03.047 --> 02:57:06.553
<v Marwan Altaie>I was just curious. OK, fine. Fine.
Because I have a terminology at different</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/913-6
02:57:06.553 --> 02:57:07.857
<v Marwan Altaie>prices. Completely. Yeah. OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/914-0
02:57:08.217 --> 02:57:11.617
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool. Let's move on then.
So we got that we got that evidence on</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/914-1
02:57:11.617 --> 02:57:14.076
<v Marwan Altaie>closure.
I'm still not sure where we're saying</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/914-2
02:57:14.076 --> 02:57:18.103
<v Marwan Altaie>we're gonna be hosting that if we're
saying it's 3 E or we want a screenshot</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/914-3
02:57:18.103 --> 02:57:20.980
<v Marwan Altaie>from three E into ServiceNow or on
ServiceNow is done.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/914-4
02:57:20.980 --> 02:57:23.857
<v Marwan Altaie>We need a screenshot of ServiceNow back
in three east.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/915-0
02:57:24.817 --> 02:57:27.904
<v Marwan Altaie>I think we need both.
You don't need it either way,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/915-1
02:57:27.904 --> 02:57:31.644
<v Marwan Altaie>as long as it's in one.
I don't really care. Just one is fine,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/915-2
02:57:31.644 --> 02:57:32.297
<v Marwan Altaie>but I mean.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/916-0
02:57:35.417 --> 02:57:41.476
<v Marwan Altaie>Anna was suggesting so say for example
you put the service now reference into 3E</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/916-1
02:57:41.476 --> 02:57:45.440
<v Marwan Altaie>as you're processing everything, right?
That's fine.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/916-2
02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:50.526
<v Marwan Altaie>The only time that becomes important
again is when you're auditing.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/916-3
02:57:50.526 --> 02:57:52.097
<v Marwan Altaie>So can you run in 3E?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/917-0
02:57:52.217 --> 02:57:57.799
<v Marwan Altaie>A report to pull out all the relevant
cases and the no so you still need to go</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/917-1
02:57:57.799 --> 02:58:02.957
<v Marwan Altaie>into each one individual. Yeah.
So it's a part of the attachment part in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/917-2
02:58:02.957 --> 02:58:06.207
<v Marwan Altaie>3D.
So if I'm thinking about how AP use it as</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/917-3
02:58:06.207 --> 02:58:07.337
<v Marwan Altaie>a function, the.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/918-0
02:58:07.857 --> 02:58:12.029
<v Marwan Altaie>We'll download a copy of an invoice,
attach it in there,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/918-1
02:58:12.029 --> 02:58:16.273
<v Marwan Altaie>but also attach the shell current shell
well case number,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/918-2
02:58:16.273 --> 02:58:20.738
<v Marwan Altaie>because if we ever need to refer back
something looks weird,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/918-3
02:58:20.738 --> 02:58:26.300
<v Marwan Altaie>or if we have questions. If. Yeah,
because the auditors will have a copy of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/918-4
02:58:26.300 --> 02:58:27.617
<v Marwan Altaie>all of our Ledger.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/919-0
02:58:27.777 --> 02:58:30.039
<v Marwan Altaie>So they'll just pull out the
disbursements,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/919-1
02:58:30.039 --> 02:58:33.020
<v Marwan Altaie>we can go in and then have a look at the
shell reference.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/919-2
02:58:33.020 --> 02:58:36.463
<v Marwan Altaie>It is a little bit manual.
You have to then go into shell and open</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/919-3
02:58:36.463 --> 02:58:38.828
<v Marwan Altaie>up that case,
but it's got the history of the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/919-4
02:58:38.828 --> 02:58:41.500
<v Marwan Altaie>conversation.
So if we've entered the matter number</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/919-5
02:58:41.500 --> 02:58:43.865
<v Marwan Altaie>wrong,
we can then refer back to the original</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/919-6
02:58:43.865 --> 02:58:47.257
<v Marwan Altaie>source without actually having to export
all of that information.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/920-0
02:58:47.337 --> 02:58:50.634
<v Marwan Altaie>And just the invoice,
which is the more important part,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/920-1
02:58:50.634 --> 02:58:54.343
<v Marwan Altaie>because other people need to access that.
OK, so it's helpful,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/920-2
02:58:54.343 --> 02:58:58.582
<v Marwan Altaie>but you can't run a report to see what
does or does not have a talking,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/920-3
02:58:58.582 --> 02:59:02.644
<v Marwan Altaie>because I assume it's only exceptions
that the auditors ask you for.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/920-4
02:59:02.644 --> 02:59:07.177
<v Marwan Altaie>They're just asking, for example,
end 20 globally and just say show me them.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/921-0
02:59:07.337 --> 02:59:11.535
<v Marwan Altaie>And you'd still be able to just open that
case up in three a grab the ServiceNow</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/921-1
02:59:11.535 --> 02:59:15.786
<v Marwan Altaie>reference and then pop into ServiceNow
and extract the information that you need.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/921-2
02:59:15.786 --> 02:59:18.688
<v Marwan Altaie>Absolutely fine. So is there a need,
though in three E?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/921-3
02:59:18.688 --> 02:59:22.057
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm thinking about other users of three E
to be able to see the.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/922-0
02:59:22.657 --> 02:59:27.021
<v Marwan Altaie>Screenshot of the approval in three E is
there ever a need for that? Well,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/922-1
02:59:27.021 --> 02:59:30.163
<v Marwan Altaie>that's fine. So the reference number,
we'll cover it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/922-2
02:59:30.163 --> 02:59:34.701
<v Marwan Altaie>Then you just put your reference number
in the service now and it'll bring up</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/922-3
02:59:34.701 --> 02:59:38.657
<v Marwan Altaie>your approval trails and any other
information. So we're saying we.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/923-0
02:59:39.737 --> 02:59:44.774
<v Marwan Altaie>So you'll need to take a step in your
process to put the reference number into</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/923-1
02:59:44.774 --> 02:59:48.026
<v Marwan Altaie>3E, yeah,
and then save whatever proof it is into.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/923-2
02:59:48.026 --> 02:59:52.744
<v Marwan Altaie>ServiceNow. Yeah, we do URL work. I mean,
we could copy URL from the case</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/923-3
02:59:52.744 --> 02:59:56.697
<v Marwan Altaie>ServiceNow stick it in three E so then
you're straight there.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/924-0
02:59:58.217 --> 03:00:01.177
<v Marwan Altaie>Well, you did. If you had a URL,
you'd need to also be able to access the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/924-1
03:00:01.177 --> 03:00:04.177
<v Marwan Altaie>service now and to get. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
they're going to have to anyway.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/924-2
03:00:04.177 --> 03:00:06.097
<v Marwan Altaie>Anyone that's interested would have to
look at,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/924-3
03:00:06.097 --> 03:00:08.417
<v Marwan Altaie>have to get that case number and put it
into service now.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/924-4
03:00:08.417 --> 03:00:10.457
<v Marwan Altaie>And if they haven't got access,
they won't see it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/925-0
03:00:12.057 --> 03:00:14.359
<v Marwan Altaie>I do. I'll.
I'll leave it open for now and we'll,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/925-1
03:00:14.359 --> 03:00:17.121
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll. We'll come back with potential.
Ease of using. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/925-2
03:00:17.121 --> 03:00:19.929
<v Marwan Altaie>I don't know if you were.
I was working three in the fields,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/925-3
03:00:19.929 --> 03:00:23.244
<v Marwan Altaie>but that allows you to capture your
approvals through your actions that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/925-4
03:00:23.244 --> 03:00:26.098
<v Marwan Altaie>you're sending through ServiceNow and
it's all there. Anyway.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/925-5
03:00:26.098 --> 03:00:27.617
<v Marwan Altaie>We're not missing anything. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/926-0
03:00:27.977 --> 03:00:31.401
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, it's good. I guess. Good.
I've just made a note that we need one</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/926-1
03:00:31.401 --> 03:00:34.477
<v Marwan Altaie>system to include it,
but that doesn't matter which one it is</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/926-2
03:00:34.477 --> 03:00:37.256
<v Marwan Altaie>at the moment.
I'll leave that open and we'll take that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/926-3
03:00:37.256 --> 03:00:40.977
<v Marwan Altaie>as a user case and see what is the most
optimal. But there's some closure.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/929-0
03:00:53.097 --> 03:00:57.774
<v Marwan Altaie>Great and approvals.
We set thresholds and we're fine with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/929-1
03:00:57.774 --> 03:01:01.421
<v Marwan Altaie>that.
I'll make the change to 9999 instead of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/929-2
03:01:01.421 --> 03:01:01.817
<v Marwan Altaie>9:50.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/930-0
03:01:04.097 --> 03:01:07.697
<v Marwan Altaie>Wait, can we agree it was 10/10 K? Sorry,
10,000 and one, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/931-0
03:01:10.097 --> 03:01:15.224
<v Marwan Altaie>And I'm getting told off.
It's just like a backhand school.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/931-1
03:01:15.224 --> 03:01:19.497
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we notify any individuals teams on
completion?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/932-0
03:01:23.377 --> 03:01:26.161
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes,
we tend to actually we tend to let the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/932-1
03:01:26.161 --> 03:01:29.577
<v Marwan Altaie>the partner know we've written it off.
Do we need to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/933-0
03:01:31.337 --> 03:01:35.352
<v Marwan Altaie>Does it add more work then it's actually
giving some like to know some.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/933-1
03:01:35.352 --> 03:01:39.089
<v Marwan Altaie>I'll actually be honest.
I don't do it till I do it to some as the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/933-2
03:01:39.089 --> 03:01:43.271
<v Marwan Altaie>partners we put that on a maybe basis I
think we can set it up though that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/933-3
03:01:43.271 --> 03:01:46.450
<v Marwan Altaie>because if you're doing everything to
ServiceNow anyway,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/933-4
03:01:46.450 --> 03:01:50.577
<v Marwan Altaie>it's just a case of this is closed.
So the assumption is yeah, your debt.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/934-0
03:01:50.657 --> 03:01:53.460
<v Marwan Altaie>It's been written off.
It doesn't necessarily need to be a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/934-1
03:01:53.460 --> 03:01:54.457
<v Marwan Altaie>notification I guess.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/935-0
03:01:55.657 --> 03:01:58.658
<v Marwan Altaie>It's personal preference,
it's it's an interesting point because</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/935-1
03:01:58.658 --> 03:02:02.535
<v Marwan Altaie>it's come up quite a lot in the last week.
Some partners like feedback, some don't.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/935-2
03:02:02.535 --> 03:02:05.720
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, it's really. Yeah, it's,
I don't know which ones do which ones</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/935-3
03:02:05.720 --> 03:02:08.213
<v Marwan Altaie>don't know which ones will want to be
waiting for it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/935-4
03:02:08.213 --> 03:02:11.767
<v Marwan Altaie>which is why we maybe don't make it
automatic. But you can make a call. See,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/935-5
03:02:11.767 --> 03:02:15.137
<v Marwan Altaie>that's quite good. If you've got a manual.
Yes, I know that this person.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/936-0
03:02:15.297 --> 03:02:18.417
<v Marwan Altaie>You can do it. You can absolutely do that.
It's just another. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/936-1
03:02:18.417 --> 03:02:19.977
<v Marwan Altaie>It's just another message through.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/937-0
03:02:21.257 --> 03:02:24.683
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we need to notify any other finance
teams that the bad day it's been written</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/937-1
03:02:24.683 --> 03:02:26.396
<v Marwan Altaie>off?
It just happens in three E it just</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/937-2
03:02:26.396 --> 03:02:29.994
<v Marwan Altaie>happens because and then the AR drops off
the invoices drop off the there's nothing</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/937-3
03:02:29.994 --> 03:02:33.334
<v Marwan Altaie>in whip then then because we don't be
working progress before it goes because</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/937-4
03:02:33.334 --> 03:02:35.732
<v Marwan Altaie>it's a receipt,
a fee's been paid when paid so it's got</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/937-5
03:02:35.732 --> 03:02:38.130
<v Marwan Altaie>disbursements.
You know to find them so that everything</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/937-6
03:02:38.130 --> 03:02:40.657
<v Marwan Altaie>or it's automatically it all happens.
Other than that the.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/938-0
03:02:40.817 --> 03:02:42.921
<v Marwan Altaie>Approvers would have already seen it
there.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/938-1
03:02:42.921 --> 03:02:46.697
<v Marwan Altaie>The only other people I could think that
we'd need to know. I think that's it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/938-2
03:02:46.697 --> 03:02:50.474
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. What we did for the last project.
Our work on a similar thing where they</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/938-3
03:02:50.474 --> 03:02:53.007
<v Marwan Altaie>didn't know if they wanted the e-mail
notifications.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/938-4
03:02:53.007 --> 03:02:56.306
<v Marwan Altaie>We set them up or we just switched them
off. Yeah. So in ServiceNow,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/938-5
03:02:56.306 --> 03:02:59.891
<v Marwan Altaie>there is a function where you can just
ping out emails from tickets. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/938-6
03:02:59.891 --> 03:03:00.417
<v Marwan Altaie>and if you.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/939-0
03:03:00.537 --> 03:03:03.860
<v Marwan Altaie>I think automation's a good idea.
All you need to do is we can set them up</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/939-1
03:03:03.860 --> 03:03:06.075
<v Marwan Altaie>and then just switch it on if it's
requested for.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/939-2
03:03:06.075 --> 03:03:08.999
<v Marwan Altaie>That could maybe be the approach. Yeah,
I think that makes sense.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/939-3
03:03:08.999 --> 03:03:11.569
<v Marwan Altaie>And there's probably a wider business
discussion to have.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/939-4
03:03:11.569 --> 03:03:15.113
<v Marwan Altaie>We don't want to over saturate people
with notifications, but at the same time,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/939-5
03:03:15.113 --> 03:03:18.746
<v Marwan Altaie>maybe you want to start to manually start
off with a bit just to ease people into</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/939-6
03:03:18.746 --> 03:03:20.297
<v Marwan Altaie>the. I think that would be decided.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/940-0
03:03:20.497 --> 03:03:23.818
<v Marwan Altaie>From a persona perspective,
so depending on what we were looking at</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/940-1
03:03:23.818 --> 03:03:24.257
<v Marwan Altaie>it, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/941-0
03:03:29.497 --> 03:03:33.063
<v Marwan Altaie>And we said the region is now
standardised,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/941-1
03:03:33.063 --> 03:03:38.737
<v Marwan Altaie>that side of absolutely global standard
ignore Australia's processes.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/942-0
03:03:41.897 --> 03:03:44.064
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool,
and it's probably the same thing as the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/942-1
03:03:44.064 --> 03:03:47.219
<v Marwan Altaie>last one. Slas or timing.
Is there any kind of real triggers or is</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/942-2
03:03:47.219 --> 03:03:50.657
<v Marwan Altaie>it more of a internally it would be nice
to do it within 24 or 40. Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/942-3
03:03:50.657 --> 03:03:53.907
<v Marwan Altaie>I've seen what we said before,
kind of within about 24 or 48 hours I</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/942-4
03:03:53.907 --> 03:03:56.968
<v Marwan Altaie>think good, yeah, expected to be done.
Mm-hmm. I just one thing.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/942-5
03:03:56.968 --> 03:03:59.417
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's just probably just a more generic
question.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/943-0
03:04:00.497 --> 03:04:04.991
<v Marwan Altaie>We've obviously got this ownership,
so we've got the the work capital manager,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/943-1
03:04:04.991 --> 03:04:09.428
<v Marwan Altaie>Credit Control manager who can process
these transactions, supposing Stephen,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/943-2
03:04:09.428 --> 03:04:12.785
<v Marwan Altaie>myself and Mimi,
who would be the three people that can do</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/943-3
03:04:12.785 --> 03:04:15.913
<v Marwan Altaie>this are all off at the same time,
which could happen.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/943-4
03:04:15.913 --> 03:04:19.497
<v Marwan Altaie>We're in different regions in Asia.
Australian Stephen's here.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/944-0
03:04:20.217 --> 03:04:20.337
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/945-0
03:04:20.417 --> 03:04:23.644
<v Marwan Altaie>Is there like a delegate functionality
where you can kind of say someone needs</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/945-1
03:04:23.644 --> 03:04:26.095
<v Marwan Altaie>to come? Yeah. OK.
So if we're all going to be a way we can</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/945-2
03:04:26.095 --> 03:04:28.954
<v Marwan Altaie>nominate Jill, for example,
we could process all our bad debt writers</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/945-3
03:04:28.954 --> 03:04:31.405
<v Marwan Altaie>for us. If you have that matrix,
that'll be really helpful.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/945-4
03:04:31.405 --> 03:04:34.714
<v Marwan Altaie>Because then that can drive our solution.
We don't have one. That's the problem.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/945-5
03:04:34.714 --> 03:04:37.614
<v Marwan Altaie>That's what I was just thinking.
So I guess we could we if we picked a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/945-6
03:04:37.614 --> 03:04:39.697
<v Marwan Altaie>maybe a senior in our teams and they
could be our.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/946-0
03:04:40.057 --> 03:04:43.297
<v Marwan Altaie>Number two, OK, cool.
I'll add that to the list. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/947-0
03:04:45.137 --> 03:04:48.780
<v Marwan Altaie>But let's say you've got options. Well,
you might be just plan some holiday like</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/947-1
03:04:48.780 --> 03:04:51.343
<v Marwan Altaie>initially next week,
and then you can manually go in and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/947-2
03:04:51.343 --> 03:04:54.941
<v Marwan Altaie>select who you want as delegates as well.
Yeah, it might be just for approvals.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/947-3
03:04:54.941 --> 03:04:57.550
<v Marwan Altaie>It might for actioning certain requests
or cases as well,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/947-4
03:04:57.550 --> 03:05:01.238
<v Marwan Altaie>so you can you can differentiate between
the type of delegation you want as well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/947-5
03:05:01.238 --> 03:05:02.137
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, cool. Excellent.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/948-0
03:05:02.937 --> 03:05:04.257
<v Marwan Altaie>I'll add that to that list.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/949-0
03:05:06.257 --> 03:05:09.949
<v Marwan Altaie>I've made all the notes.
I'm happy with this discussion.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/949-1
03:05:09.949 --> 03:05:15.131
<v Marwan Altaie>Is there anything I've missed or that's
worth or any nuance that Australia that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/949-2
03:05:15.131 --> 03:05:19.211
<v Marwan Altaie>we have to create a new workflow for?
Nope, all good. Perfect.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/949-3
03:05:19.211 --> 03:05:20.377
<v Marwan Altaie>There's a capture.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/950-0
03:05:21.057 --> 03:05:27.861
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean first from Australia,
that was a that was a joke more for joy,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/950-1
03:05:27.861 --> 03:05:30.097
<v Marwan Altaie>just change management.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/951-0
03:05:32.137 --> 03:05:34.137
<v Marwan Altaie>I was just doing everyone tell them,
just do it. That's fine.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/952-0
03:05:36.137 --> 03:05:36.257
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/954-0
03:05:39.977 --> 03:05:44.938
<v Marwan Altaie>We we love more nuances and region based
information same as last time.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/954-1
03:05:44.938 --> 03:05:48.107
<v Marwan Altaie>What data is useful,
what data is not useful.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/954-2
03:05:48.107 --> 03:05:52.448
<v Marwan Altaie>Are we using the same message type?
It's going to be the same,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/954-3
03:05:52.448 --> 03:05:55.617
<v Marwan Altaie>so it's bad debt,
it's bad debt reach entity.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/955-0
03:05:56.057 --> 03:06:00.301
<v Marwan Altaie>Not needed.
Submitted by is needed a matter.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/955-1
03:06:00.301 --> 03:06:07.468
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes you need invoice numbers as well,
so you need to spite a state specific</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/955-2
03:06:07.468 --> 03:06:08.977
<v Marwan Altaie>invoice numbers.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/956-0
03:06:12.377 --> 03:06:16.366
<v Marwan Altaie>And then obviously the total amount
that's going to be written off said</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/956-1
03:06:16.366 --> 03:06:19.025
<v Marwan Altaie>numbers, there couldn't be more than one.
Yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/956-2
03:06:19.025 --> 03:06:23.236
<v Marwan Altaie>so bad data write off could be at one
invoice, it could be 20 invoices. OK,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/956-3
03:06:23.236 --> 03:06:26.449
<v Marwan Altaie>that's good to know if the function,
it could be a class.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/956-4
03:06:26.449 --> 03:06:30.992
<v Marwan Altaie>It's generally a class across one matter,
but you could potentially have a client</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/956-5
03:06:30.992 --> 03:06:31.657
<v Marwan Altaie>for example.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/957-0
03:06:31.817 --> 03:06:36.043
<v Marwan Altaie>Goes bankrupt. That has multiple matters,
and you might you would get approval at a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/957-1
03:06:36.043 --> 03:06:36.697
<v Marwan Altaie>client level.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/958-0
03:06:38.257 --> 03:06:41.676
<v Marwan Altaie>And would you want one request per
invoice or just 111 request as whole is</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/958-1
03:06:41.676 --> 03:06:44.137
<v Marwan Altaie>what we get.
We get one e-mail to say I want to write</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/958-2
03:06:44.137 --> 03:06:47.464
<v Marwan Altaie>off 20 invoices for this client because
they've got into administration.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/958-3
03:06:47.464 --> 03:06:50.472
<v Marwan Altaie>I want to write off one invoice because
the client's ignoring me,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/958-4
03:06:50.472 --> 03:06:53.663
<v Marwan Altaie>whatever it might be. Yeah.
And we want to give them functionality to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/958-5
03:06:53.663 --> 03:06:57.537
<v Marwan Altaie>be able to add as many invoice numbers as
possible. Exactly right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/959-0
03:06:57.697 --> 03:07:00.101
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.
Is there a format for that invoice</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/959-1
03:07:00.101 --> 03:07:03.327
<v Marwan Altaie>numbers that standardised or is this
another open? No,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/959-2
03:07:03.327 --> 03:07:06.376
<v Marwan Altaie>it's different in depending what country
you're in.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/959-3
03:07:06.376 --> 03:07:10.422
<v Marwan Altaie>So different countries have different
number formats. Do we want to.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/959-4
03:07:10.422 --> 03:07:14.937
<v Marwan Altaie>I know we said we don't need region
entity, but what we can do is we can if.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/960-0
03:07:15.337 --> 03:07:18.797
<v Marwan Altaie>If we select a certain region,
we could potentially use field logic so</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/960-1
03:07:18.797 --> 03:07:22.257
<v Marwan Altaie>we can put validation based on region.
Or is that overcomplicating it?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/961-0
03:07:25.617 --> 03:07:25.857
<v Marwan Altaie>It's.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/962-0
03:07:28.337 --> 03:07:30.497
<v Marwan Altaie>That's a good idea,
but it might be over complicated,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/962-1
03:07:30.497 --> 03:07:31.657
<v Marwan Altaie>but I'm just trying to think.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/963-0
03:07:33.417 --> 03:07:35.759
<v Marwan Altaie>That way your data is consistent with
that region's invoice,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/963-1
03:07:35.759 --> 03:07:37.217
<v Marwan Altaie>and you don't have the back and forth.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/964-0
03:07:39.697 --> 03:07:43.893
<v Marwan Altaie>The only problem is that you might have a
requester that say you might be a Jakarta</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/964-1
03:07:43.893 --> 03:07:47.938
<v Marwan Altaie>and requesting a client level debt that
gets written off and that debt might sit</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/964-2
03:07:47.938 --> 03:07:49.137
<v Marwan Altaie>across multiple regions.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/965-0
03:07:51.017 --> 03:07:53.517
<v Marwan Altaie>Sorry, the number four in fact,
that probably wouldn't work.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/965-1
03:07:53.517 --> 03:07:56.509
<v Marwan Altaie>It's limiting more so than benefiting.
Yeah, because yeah, that's right.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/965-2
03:07:56.509 --> 03:07:57.657
<v Marwan Altaie>So good suggestion, but now.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/966-0
03:07:59.617 --> 03:07:59.737
<v Marwan Altaie>So.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/967-0
03:08:02.937 --> 03:08:04.657
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, this is, this is but well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/968-0
03:08:06.577 --> 03:08:11.241
<v Marwan Altaie>Yes, you do get, we will get peas.
Who will send it on a behalf of a partner</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/968-1
03:08:11.241 --> 03:08:14.511
<v Marwan Altaie>and we. Yeah,
we have to assume that that if the P is</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/968-2
03:08:14.511 --> 03:08:19.417
<v Marwan Altaie>sending it and then saying so and so has
approved it, we will take that as a OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/969-0
03:08:21.897 --> 03:08:26.154
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's not always the peas or mostly the
peas for bad debt writers is actually</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/969-1
03:08:26.154 --> 03:08:30.144
<v Marwan Altaie>mostly the partners that send it,
because they're kind of they have to own</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/969-2
03:08:30.144 --> 03:08:33.603
<v Marwan Altaie>up and, you know, make builders crap.
And they have to admit it,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/969-3
03:08:33.603 --> 03:08:37.061
<v Marwan Altaie>which they don't like to,
but they will do it themselves because</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/969-4
03:08:37.061 --> 03:08:38.817
<v Marwan Altaie>they don't want to tell the peas.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/970-0
03:08:39.097 --> 03:08:40.097
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/971-0
03:08:41.977 --> 03:08:46.233
<v Marwan Altaie>I think I think again from last week,
I think we agreed that we're going to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/971-1
03:08:46.233 --> 03:08:50.377
<v Marwan Altaie>have on behalf of a cross finance,
weren't we? Yeah. Yeah. Have to. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/972-0
03:08:52.777 --> 03:08:53.097
<v Marwan Altaie>And.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/973-0
03:08:54.977 --> 03:08:58.314
<v Marwan Altaie>Currency reason.
I'm assuming that's that's beneficial.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/973-1
03:08:58.314 --> 03:09:01.352
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah. Yeah.
And then reason we'll say same as last</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/973-2
03:09:01.352 --> 03:09:04.212
<v Marwan Altaie>one. Well,
reason could be a free and open text</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/973-3
03:09:04.212 --> 03:09:07.132
<v Marwan Altaie>field. Again,
the support is generally a written</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/973-4
03:09:07.132 --> 03:09:10.706
<v Marwan Altaie>explanation anyway.
So the attachment normally explains why</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/973-5
03:09:10.706 --> 03:09:12.017
<v Marwan Altaie>it's been written off.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/974-0
03:09:12.457 --> 03:09:15.607
<v Marwan Altaie>Because if you're requesting write off
from a practise head,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/974-1
03:09:15.607 --> 03:09:19.067
<v Marwan Altaie>from from Mark or Paul,
you know members of the ET division heads.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/974-2
03:09:19.067 --> 03:09:23.302
<v Marwan Altaie>You generally have to have a very good
explanation of why you're writing off 100,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/974-3
03:09:23.302 --> 03:09:26.297
<v Marwan Altaie>200 and 50,000 LB.
And then generally write a full spiel.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/975-0
03:09:29.017 --> 03:09:32.897
<v Marwan Altaie>We can a lot of these feel like they can
be optional. So yeah, absolutely.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/975-1
03:09:32.897 --> 03:09:37.035
<v Marwan Altaie>The only caveat to that is when you start
getting information and there will be</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/975-2
03:09:37.035 --> 03:09:39.311
<v Marwan Altaie>your current issue is you're chasing a
lot.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/975-3
03:09:39.311 --> 03:09:43.191
<v Marwan Altaie>If you don't force users down the journey.
And I don't use the word force,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/975-4
03:09:43.191 --> 03:09:46.915
<v Marwan Altaie>but ultimately that's what you're doing.
You still have the same issue.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/975-5
03:09:46.915 --> 03:09:48.777
<v Marwan Altaie>So it's just kind of custom benefit.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/976-0
03:09:48.857 --> 03:09:51.865
<v Marwan Altaie>But do you wanna get the initial ugliness
about the change piece,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/976-1
03:09:51.865 --> 03:09:55.603
<v Marwan Altaie>but then ultimately your data's better?
Or do you wanna give them that as is feel</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/976-2
03:09:55.603 --> 03:09:58.657
<v Marwan Altaie>of if you have it, put it in.
At least we have that information to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/976-3
03:09:58.657 --> 03:10:00.982
<v Marwan Altaie>begin with.
Do we have to change to enter side now</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/976-4
03:10:00.982 --> 03:10:04.856
<v Marwan Altaie>whether a field is no, no, no, no, no, OK,
this is just an initial discussion. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/976-5
03:10:04.856 --> 03:10:06.497
<v Marwan Altaie>No, no, no, no. I get what you mean.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/977-0
03:10:07.177 --> 03:10:09.277
<v Marwan Altaie>Look,
I think where we can make it mandatory,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/977-1
03:10:09.277 --> 03:10:11.285
<v Marwan Altaie>we absolutely shouldn't be honest with
you.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/977-2
03:10:11.285 --> 03:10:14.069
<v Marwan Altaie>I think we should draw push as much as
possible. Absolutely.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/977-3
03:10:14.069 --> 03:10:17.584
<v Marwan Altaie>But I think there's a couple of fields
I'm looking at there and thinking not</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/977-4
03:10:17.584 --> 03:10:20.688
<v Marwan Altaie>sure I need to think about it. Yeah,
that's fine. Yeah, absolutely.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/977-5
03:10:20.688 --> 03:10:22.057
<v Marwan Altaie>I'm a pro manager. Absolutely.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/978-0
03:10:23.177 --> 03:10:27.697
<v Marwan Altaie>Can I just on the client matter field?
Is this going to be client or matter or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/978-1
03:10:27.697 --> 03:10:32.331
<v Marwan Altaie>are we going to have a separate client
field and a separate matter field because</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/978-2
03:10:32.331 --> 03:10:37.022
<v Marwan Altaie>you're not going to report either as long
as you've got the invoice number field,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/978-3
03:10:37.022 --> 03:10:39.711
<v Marwan Altaie>it doesn't actually matter to me too much.
OK,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/978-4
03:10:39.711 --> 03:10:42.057
<v Marwan Altaie>the invoice number is the important ones.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/979-0
03:10:42.137 --> 03:10:46.022
<v Marwan Altaie>Because that's what you will.
There's the specific transactions you'll</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/979-1
03:10:46.022 --> 03:10:50.454
<v Marwan Altaie>write off and we expect people to list
out the invoice numbers properly with the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/979-2
03:10:50.454 --> 03:10:53.026
<v Marwan Altaie>values. OK,
so you need the values against the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/979-3
03:10:53.026 --> 03:10:56.418
<v Marwan Altaie>invoices as well, OK,
and then got OK and the amount to write</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/979-4
03:10:56.418 --> 03:10:58.716
<v Marwan Altaie>off.
So you'd need amount to write off by</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/979-5
03:10:58.716 --> 03:10:59.537
<v Marwan Altaie>invoice number.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/980-0
03:11:00.057 --> 03:11:02.458
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah.
Or they might just say here's a list of</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/980-1
03:11:02.458 --> 03:11:05.746
<v Marwan Altaie>20 invoice numbers. Total is 3 million,
brought off 3 million,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/980-2
03:11:05.746 --> 03:11:09.034
<v Marwan Altaie>and we'll accept either.
All but the the invoice number is the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/980-3
03:11:09.034 --> 03:11:12.427
<v Marwan Altaie>most important bit. OK,
we could do that quite small if we could</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/980-4
03:11:12.427 --> 03:11:15.297
<v Marwan Altaie>just do ads, but by somewhere,
whatever the end there.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/981-0
03:11:15.977 --> 03:11:20.159
<v Marwan Altaie>As long as you don't have to make the
manually fill out the yeah,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/981-1
03:11:20.159 --> 03:11:24.215
<v Marwan Altaie>each one 'cause you won't have one more
for not doing that. OK,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/981-2
03:11:24.215 --> 03:11:29.410
<v Marwan Altaie>we'll we'll take that away. Yeah. Yeah,
I guess is is clients matter even needed.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/981-3
03:11:29.410 --> 03:11:29.537
<v Marwan Altaie>I.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/982-0
03:11:31.577 --> 03:11:34.424
<v Marwan Altaie>Thinking the less fuel the better.
Basically it's obviously needed.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/982-1
03:11:34.424 --> 03:11:37.858
<v Marwan Altaie>I I I would as a character because just
in case they write down what invoice they</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/982-2
03:11:37.858 --> 03:11:41.165
<v Marwan Altaie>write down the wrong invoice number and
it doesn't tell you up with the matter</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/982-3
03:11:41.165 --> 03:11:44.306
<v Marwan Altaie>and matter name or the client name.
At least you can then query it are the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/982-4
03:11:44.306 --> 03:11:47.404
<v Marwan Altaie>approval levels different are the
approval levels different for client or</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/982-5
03:11:47.404 --> 03:11:47.697
<v Marwan Altaie>matter?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/983-0
03:11:48.617 --> 03:11:51.552
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, no,
it's just done on purely numerical valley.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/983-1
03:11:51.552 --> 03:11:53.989
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah,
we use we always ask for a client and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/983-2
03:11:53.989 --> 03:11:57.699
<v Marwan Altaie>matter like client name matter name.
So that we like for cash use,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/983-3
03:11:57.699 --> 03:12:01.298
<v Marwan Altaie>we can sense check that we're putting
things to the right thing.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/983-4
03:12:01.298 --> 03:12:05.507
<v Marwan Altaie>So it could even if it's just used for
your sense check yeah Chris would be</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/983-5
03:12:05.507 --> 03:12:07.777
<v Marwan Altaie>worthwhile that's why I would just sense.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/984-0
03:12:08.177 --> 03:12:11.456
<v Marwan Altaie>Just a matter of client against the
invoice record just to make sure.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/984-1
03:12:11.456 --> 03:12:13.657
<v Marwan Altaie>So we have these different levels of
approval.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/985-0
03:12:14.937 --> 03:12:17.664
<v Marwan Altaie>Is that for the total debt rights off or
is it total debt,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/985-1
03:12:17.664 --> 03:12:19.097
<v Marwan Altaie>it's total debt rights off, OK.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/986-0
03:12:26.497 --> 03:12:32.188
<v Marwan Altaie>So these fields are they all currently
when the partners are requesting for the</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/986-1
03:12:32.188 --> 03:12:37.665
<v Marwan Altaie>debt to be written off via e-mail,
do they provide all this same information</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/986-2
03:12:37.665 --> 03:12:42.857
<v Marwan Altaie>or is this additional fields now to what
they currently have to provide?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/987-0
03:12:43.577 --> 03:12:46.181
<v Marwan Altaie>No.
They provide all of that information in</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/987-1
03:12:46.181 --> 03:12:50.855
<v Marwan Altaie>that same one e-mail in one e-mail. OK,
we might have to go back and sometimes</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/987-2
03:12:50.855 --> 03:12:54.406
<v Marwan Altaie>ask for something additional in.
But in generally, yes, OK,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/987-3
03:12:54.406 --> 03:12:57.897
<v Marwan Altaie>list of invoices values reason why it's
being written off.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/988-0
03:13:00.337 --> 03:13:02.651
<v Marwan Altaie>You know, it's submitted by. Yeah. Yeah.
OK,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/988-1
03:13:02.651 --> 03:13:06.663
<v Marwan Altaie>because the only thing I was thinking
from a change management perspective is</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/988-2
03:13:06.663 --> 03:13:10.777
<v Marwan Altaie>that if we were already asking them to go
into ServiceNow to fill in this form.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/988-3
03:13:10.777 --> 03:13:14.583
<v Marwan Altaie>If we're then asking them to in
additional information to what they would</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/988-4
03:13:14.583 --> 03:13:17.309
<v Marwan Altaie>normally do,
then that's going to be a bit more of a</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/988-5
03:13:17.309 --> 03:13:19.417
<v Marwan Altaie>tricky situation to get them to adopt it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/989-0
03:13:21.737 --> 03:13:24.745
<v Marwan Altaie>Yeah, they part of hate.
The emails that float around this because</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/989-1
03:13:24.745 --> 03:13:28.382
<v Marwan Altaie>they end up sometimes going around the
business to 20 other people and they just</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/989-2
03:13:28.382 --> 03:13:32.019
<v Marwan Altaie>sit and this this is a real time sale for
them, OK, that's good. We can sell it.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/989-3
03:13:32.019 --> 03:13:35.791
<v Marwan Altaie>So this is going to route your approvals.
You won't just sit there for three months</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/989-4
03:13:35.791 --> 03:13:37.901
<v Marwan Altaie>waiting for Paul Jenkins to approve
something,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/989-5
03:13:37.901 --> 03:13:39.697
<v Marwan Altaie>you know and they won't lose the e-mail.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/990-0
03:13:39.777 --> 03:13:43.181
<v Marwan Altaie>Trailer as well because I'm sure they get
probably tonnes and tonnes of emails,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/990-1
03:13:43.181 --> 03:13:45.988
<v Marwan Altaie>so if they need to track it they can
easily go into the platform.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/990-2
03:13:45.988 --> 03:13:47.137
<v Marwan Altaie>This is a nice one for you.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/991-0
03:13:51.457 --> 03:13:55.211
<v Marwan Altaie>Cool, I've made a note of all of that.
It's being very kind of specific about</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/991-1
03:13:55.211 --> 03:13:58.579
<v Marwan Altaie>this point, doesn't need to be,
but is it worth separating client and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/991-2
03:13:58.579 --> 03:14:00.937
<v Marwan Altaie>matter,
or should we just have one field for it?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/992-0
03:14:07.617 --> 03:14:09.196
<v Marwan Altaie>I mean,
you could have to separate it out and</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/992-1
03:14:09.196 --> 03:14:11.187
<v Marwan Altaie>then if they feel as long as they're
feeling one of them,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/992-2
03:14:11.187 --> 03:14:12.697
<v Marwan Altaie>but it doesn't matter too much. Yeah.
Cool.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/993-0
03:14:14.097 --> 03:14:18.737
<v Marwan Altaie>He did OK. Everyone happy with that day,
Ralph?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/994-0
03:14:21.657 --> 03:14:25.857
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, I'm just aware it's 1220.
We've been going for an hour.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/994-1
03:14:25.857 --> 03:14:31.317
<v Marwan Altaie>Do we want to keep going through to lunch?
Do we want to take a little break?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/994-2
03:14:31.317 --> 03:14:33.417
<v Marwan Altaie>What's everyone's preferences?</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/995-0
03:14:38.097 --> 03:14:43.172
<v Marwan Altaie>Julia in my agenda was,
I think I put 1:00. Mind you guys,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/995-1
03:14:43.172 --> 03:14:47.902
<v Marwan Altaie>what you did well,
what I would say is the remaining 4</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/995-2
03:14:47.902 --> 03:14:52.977
<v Marwan Altaie>processes touch on much bigger.
Cashier is quite a lot so.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/996-0
03:14:53.257 --> 03:14:57.057
<v Marwan Altaie>Well, are we better? Yeah,
we're better off going for lunch now with</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/996-1
03:14:57.057 --> 03:15:01.628
<v Marwan Altaie>the hopes of catching Martin after one.
Yep, in case for one hour. And then, yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/996-2
03:15:01.628 --> 03:15:04.767
<v Marwan Altaie>So we come back.
I'll check the Deep's calendar as well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/996-3
03:15:04.767 --> 03:15:07.521
<v Marwan Altaie>'cause.
Then I can give him some time to get back</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/996-4
03:15:07.521 --> 03:15:08.457
<v Marwan Altaie>in as well. Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/997-0
03:15:08.657 --> 03:15:11.251
<v Marwan Altaie>I spoke to Sandeep,
I don't think he's gonna make it along.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/997-1
03:15:11.251 --> 03:15:14.797
<v Marwan Altaie>We'll just need to wait till Martin comes
online to see if he's able to step away</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/997-2
03:15:14.797 --> 03:15:16.872
<v Marwan Altaie>from the team. Yeah, look,
worst case scenario,</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/997-3
03:15:16.872 --> 03:15:19.596
<v Marwan Altaie>I'll cover what I can.
And I've got time with the team Tuesday</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/997-4
03:15:19.596 --> 03:15:22.493
<v Marwan Altaie>and Wednesday now. So, yeah,
I can cover it that way back as well.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/997-5
03:15:22.493 --> 03:15:25.217
<v Marwan Altaie>So Steven and a lot of that said that you
would care. Cash is.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/998-0
03:15:26.137 --> 03:15:29.181
<v Marwan Altaie>Local,
now UK and Australia cashiers aren't that</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/998-1
03:15:29.181 --> 03:15:32.846
<v Marwan Altaie>different. Like I said,
the only things that we have to be</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/998-2
03:15:32.846 --> 03:15:35.580
<v Marwan Altaie>careful of is just local regulations.
Yeah.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/998-3
03:15:35.580 --> 03:15:39.618
<v Marwan Altaie>And and it just makes it hard to
globalise our processes because</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/998-4
03:15:39.618 --> 03:15:42.972
<v Marwan Altaie>everything has to be done like same day,
almost week.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/998-5
03:15:42.972 --> 03:15:45.457
<v Marwan Altaie>There's not really a lot we can do that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/999-0
03:15:45.817 --> 03:15:49.645
<v Marwan Altaie>Carries over overnight,
so they're two of the biggest reasons why</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/999-1
03:15:49.645 --> 03:15:54.053
<v Marwan Altaie>we don't do each other's processes.
So I'm 80% sure I can cover more stuff.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/999-2
03:15:54.053 --> 03:15:58.809
<v Marwan Altaie>OK, we'll we aim to be back for half one,
then at least gives Martin some time to</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/999-3
03:15:58.809 --> 03:16:02.057
<v Marwan Altaie>come online and check his day and see
what's happening.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/1000-0
03:16:02.537 --> 03:16:04.897
<v Marwan Altaie>That's it. OK. Yeah. Nice one.
Thanks guys. Thank you.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/1002-0
03:16:07.497 --> 03:16:07.857
<v Parik Narain>Thanks.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/1004-0
03:16:08.657 --> 03:16:09.857
<v Marwan Altaie>Eric heard that.</v>

c5593f57-952e-449e-ad30-6c36ef8d92c8/1006-0
03:16:12.417 --> 03:16:14.617
<v Marwan Altaie>I'll assume he has 'cause.
He jumped off cheers, parrot.</v>
