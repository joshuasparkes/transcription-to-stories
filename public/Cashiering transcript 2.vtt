00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:06.559
<v Josh Sparkes>Those details are posted to take the
place well. I'm wondering.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/9-1
00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:10.337
<v Josh Sparkes>That's the bulk activity you do at the
end of the day in ServiceNow,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/9-2
00:00:10.337 --> 00:00:14.554
<v Josh Sparkes>but they've been reviewed, you know,
reviews reviewed, close complete. Yeah,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/9-3
00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:17.456
<v Josh Sparkes>it's and share.
We would have been boxes been called</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/9-4
00:00:17.456 --> 00:00:21.015
<v Josh Sparkes>scheduled requests and almost someone
almost acts as a reminder.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/11-0
00:00:21.575 --> 00:00:25.876
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's to remind us to do these peer
cheques at end of each day and we</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/11-1
00:00:25.876 --> 00:00:29.432
<v Josh Sparkes>statements and reports and all that into
those those tickets.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/11-2
00:00:29.432 --> 00:00:33.906
<v Josh Sparkes>One thing in dashboards you could have
this sort of thing that it's an end of</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/11-3
00:00:33.906 --> 00:00:36.831
<v Josh Sparkes>day activity that requires the bulk peer
reviewed.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/11-4
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:40.215
<v Josh Sparkes>You know they can check and they can go
through the cases.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/12-0
00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:43.537
<v Josh Sparkes>And not one by one,
but you can select them all and say</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/12-1
00:00:43.537 --> 00:00:47.241
<v Josh Sparkes>they've been peer reviewed, approved.
That's a potential possibility.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/12-2
00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:50.838
<v Josh Sparkes>And off the back of that request,
that's another audit trail that's</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/12-3
00:00:50.838 --> 00:00:52.055
<v Josh Sparkes>available to you. Yeah.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/13-0
00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:58.537
<v Josh Sparkes>That would work if if we have that
sitting in our dashboard,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/13-1
00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:04.392
<v Josh Sparkes>is it possible for service now to
identify what requests have come through</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/13-2
00:01:04.392 --> 00:01:08.841
<v Josh Sparkes>on the day that are relative relating to
trust receipts?</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/13-3
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:13.135
<v Josh Sparkes>So if we've got an overall category of
trust receipts?</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/14-0
00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:17.819
<v Josh Sparkes>Or incoming funds.
Is it possible that they can then be tied</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/14-1
00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:23.065
<v Josh Sparkes>to a reminder so that we can open up this
reminder to like to do the PHX?</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/14-2
00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:28.735
<v Josh Sparkes>We've already got all that ServiceNow
paperwork ready to go of all of the funds</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/14-3
00:01:28.735 --> 00:01:30.295
<v Josh Sparkes>that should have been.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/15-0
00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:33.312
<v Josh Sparkes>Proceeded.
So we've got that pre populated and we</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/15-1
00:01:33.312 --> 00:01:37.735
<v Josh Sparkes>can just run our report in 3A and that's
our 2 reports that we're sense checking.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/16-0
00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Josh Sparkes>Yes, certainly. I mean you can do that.
I mean, I don't know,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/16-1
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.777
<v Josh Sparkes>it's your reminder that you go to your
dashboards at the end of the day,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/16-2
00:01:45.777 --> 00:01:49.683
<v Josh Sparkes>see those trust fund categories and it
could be that over time you don't need</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/16-3
00:01:49.683 --> 00:01:53.590
<v Josh Sparkes>these reminders because your habit is
habit forming that you know that you're</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/16-4
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.495
<v Josh Sparkes>always going to the dashboard.
But in the first instance.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/17-0
00:01:56.975 --> 00:02:01.908
<v Josh Sparkes>You could have that reminder say do the
following on the trust on the trust. Yeah,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/17-1
00:02:01.908 --> 00:02:06.543
<v Josh Sparkes>yeah. If we have that reminder, like,
you can open that up and say, OK, well,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/17-2
00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:11.239
<v Josh Sparkes>then there's the 10 cases that will come
through today. That's trust receipts.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/17-3
00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.102
<v Josh Sparkes>These are what the cases are.
So I've got my workflow already in</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/17-4
00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:15.815
<v Josh Sparkes>service now.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/18-0
00:02:16.215 --> 00:02:19.922
<v Josh Sparkes>I can just print that off and then then
I've got my three report and that's what</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/18-1
00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm checking against. Yeah. Yeah.
I can't think about it visually that that</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/18-2
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.015
<v Josh Sparkes>you're double checking them. OK. Yeah,
that's good. 'cause. Otherwise I'll be.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/19-0
00:02:31.095 --> 00:02:34.633
<v Josh Sparkes>We kind of tie those up with the
transaction. It's from food accounts.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/19-1
00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:37.174
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not just receipts,
it's payments out as well.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/19-2
00:02:37.174 --> 00:02:41.260
<v Josh Sparkes>So it's kind of it's an Excel, you know,
formulas built on an Excel sheet that we</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/19-3
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.855
<v Josh Sparkes>just populate figures into, but.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/20-0
00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:47.972
<v Josh Sparkes>We could adapt to the peer cheques done
maybe when the receipts posted,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/20-1
00:02:47.972 --> 00:02:50.023
<v Josh Sparkes>because I don't know if you do the sign
up,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/20-2
00:02:50.023 --> 00:02:52.448
<v Josh Sparkes>but we someone posted a seat and then
someone else.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/20-3
00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:56.271
<v Josh Sparkes>The team will work at the end of the day
and make sure it's posted to the correct</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/20-4
00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:59.255
<v Josh Sparkes>matter in case of a typo and a matter
number or something. But.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/21-0
00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:03.508
<v Josh Sparkes>That's always done at the end of day,
but maybe as soon as a person's supposed</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/21-1
00:03:03.508 --> 00:03:05.892
<v Josh Sparkes>to receipt,
they could see who's available to peer</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/21-2
00:03:05.892 --> 00:03:09.726
<v Josh Sparkes>check just goes into their queue at that
given moment rather than the end of day,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/21-3
00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:13.232
<v Josh Sparkes>so you don't have this peak at the end of
the day. Could be as it happens,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/21-4
00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:16.832
<v Josh Sparkes>if there's still balance at the end of
day, make sure of presented properly,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/21-5
00:03:16.832 --> 00:03:18.655
<v Josh Sparkes>but the peer cheques have already been.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/22-0
00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:23.040
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just thinking that's the workflow
state that you've got that approval that</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/22-1
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.885
<v Josh Sparkes>it's been live checked and you're not
bound by the end of it,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/22-2
00:03:25.885 --> 00:03:29.144
<v Josh Sparkes>that you could do it as and when. Yeah,
I'm building on that workflow.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/22-3
00:03:29.144 --> 00:03:32.769
<v Josh Sparkes>It could just populate into someone's
assigned tasks so that if they have time</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/22-4
00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.247
<v Josh Sparkes>now, they can do it.
If they have time in 10 minutes,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/22-5
00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:38.551
<v Josh Sparkes>there might be true available.
If they only have time at the end of the</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/22-6
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:38.735
<v Josh Sparkes>day.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/23-0
00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:43.206
<v Josh Sparkes>We can leave it to the end of the day.
That is what we're proposing for all life</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/23-1
00:03:43.206 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Josh Sparkes>cheques across the ask teams that will
use that approval workflow.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/23-2
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.605
<v Josh Sparkes>So if it works to not do it as a bulk of
the end,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/23-3
00:03:49.605 --> 00:03:53.763
<v Josh Sparkes>it can be attached to the individual
cases and done that way at a time when</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/23-4
00:03:53.763 --> 00:03:54.255
<v Josh Sparkes>it's due.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/24-0
00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:59.383
<v Josh Sparkes>I think it would probably be worth
sharing what that bulk process looks like</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/24-1
00:03:59.383 --> 00:04:01.934
<v Josh Sparkes>just now,
so really you're taking the report and</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/24-2
00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:06.202
<v Josh Sparkes>share well from what are you checking it
against because it might be that there's</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/24-3
00:04:06.202 --> 00:04:09.378
<v Josh Sparkes>automation that means they potentially do
maybe not day one,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/24-4
00:04:09.378 --> 00:04:12.189
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's something that we can look at in
the future.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/24-5
00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.375
<v Josh Sparkes>It's not a report to take from share well.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/25-0
00:04:14.575 --> 00:04:18.291
<v Josh Sparkes>There was basically just a reminder to.
So what's we take from the bank?</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/25-1
00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:22.364
<v Josh Sparkes>This is basically what you said to you.
It's a spreadsheet that we've got where</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/25-2
00:04:22.364 --> 00:04:25.877
<v Josh Sparkes>you take a report from three.
We take a bank statement from the bank</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/25-3
00:04:25.877 --> 00:04:30.153
<v Josh Sparkes>and we OK if it's worth changing anyway,
I'm sure what that looks like. Yeah, cool.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/25-4
00:04:30.153 --> 00:04:33.615
<v Josh Sparkes>It's outside of service now,
but you're reminding yourself to take.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/26-0
00:04:33.975 --> 00:04:36.183
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah.
The transactions in three match</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/26-1
00:04:36.183 --> 00:04:40.425
<v Josh Sparkes>everything we've got coming in.
So that only isn't the Diaries that mean</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/26-2
00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:43.969
<v Josh Sparkes>that conflicts and shareware was all that
on the dashboards,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/26-3
00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:48.328
<v Josh Sparkes>be your effectively your dashboards
replacing your e-mail and your Diaries</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/26-4
00:04:48.328 --> 00:04:51.175
<v Josh Sparkes>you know is your go to place and your
allowance.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/27-0
00:04:53.935 --> 00:04:58.793
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you. That's so yeah. Peer review.

<v Josh Sparkes>to so they can, you know, be like,
why didn't you tell me?</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/27-2
00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.088
<v Josh Sparkes>I was doing one of those earlier at the
same time rather than the end of the day</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/27-3
00:05:07.088 --> 00:05:10.643
<v Josh Sparkes>or rushing out the door or something,
you know? Yes, I can.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/27-4
00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.895
<v Josh Sparkes>I can certainly contract. That's good.</v>

00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:18.495
<v Mark Sedge>Marwan's got his hand up. Debra,
if you didn't see.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/31-0
00:05:18.815 --> 00:05:21.055
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, we can't see. Sorry. Sorry.
Good morning.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/34-0
00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.962
<v Mark Sedge>No, no worries. I fig. I figured that,
which is what I was calling it out.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/30-0
00:05:21.255 --> 00:05:22.455
<v Marwan Altaie>No, no, no, no worries.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/34-1
00:05:23.962 --> 00:05:24.615
<v Mark Sedge>Go ahead, mine.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/33-0
00:05:24.335 --> 00:05:24.615
<v Josh Sparkes>Thank you.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/37-0
00:05:24.895 --> 00:05:28.685
<v Marwan Altaie>Thank. Thank you very much.
I didn't want to interrupt Deborah's flow.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/37-1
00:05:28.685 --> 00:05:32.742
<v Marwan Altaie>I know how annoying that is when you're
in the middle of a workshop just in</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/36-0
00:05:30.535 --> 00:05:30.615
<v Josh Sparkes>It.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/37-2
00:05:32.742 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Marwan Altaie>regards to,
it's a really simple kind of</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/37-3
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.973
<v Marwan Altaie>functionality,
but I know ServiceNow has e-mail triggers</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/37-4
00:05:37.973 --> 00:05:40.055
<v Marwan Altaie>and we can route those based on states.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/38-0
00:05:41.455 --> 00:05:45.595
<v Marwan Altaie>Even if e-mail was kind of moved away
from being kind of your updates and</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/38-1
00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:50.015
<v Marwan Altaie>approvals and all that and we're still
centralising in service now to ease the</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/38-2
00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:53.763
<v Marwan Altaie>change management aspect,
we probably could include kind of e-mail</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/38-3
00:05:53.763 --> 00:05:58.127
<v Marwan Altaie>triggers and e-mail notifications and
structuring those in order to help kind</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/38-4
00:05:58.127 --> 00:05:58.295
<v Marwan Altaie>of.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/39-0
00:05:58.695 --> 00:06:02.788
<v Marwan Altaie>Transition between e-mail and ServiceNow.
I don't know if that's a function that's</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/39-1
00:06:02.788 --> 00:06:04.415
<v Marwan Altaie>worth picking up as part of this.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/41-0
00:06:08.815 --> 00:06:12.763
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I mean, obviously thanks, Mom.
And for that, that's helpful.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/41-1
00:06:12.763 --> 00:06:17.477
<v Josh Sparkes>I think you know probably is you know
that will come from the change management</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/41-2
00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:21.543
<v Josh Sparkes>perspective of getting used to using
ServiceNow, the request before,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/41-3
00:06:21.543 --> 00:06:26.022
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's a whole bigger piece anyway of
transitioning from that reliance on</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/41-4
00:06:26.022 --> 00:06:27.495
<v Josh Sparkes>e-mail. I love my e-mail.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/42-0
00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:32.213
<v Josh Sparkes>Mailbox. I can read my e-mail box offline,
whatever it is. It's transitioning to.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/42-1
00:06:32.213 --> 00:06:36.250
<v Josh Sparkes>This is our new ways of working,
so it's probably a conversation across</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/42-2
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.998
<v Josh Sparkes>the whole board,
but we having that trust in the</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/42-3
00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:42.194
<v Josh Sparkes>notifications on your dashboards,
you can go through it,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/42-4
00:06:42.194 --> 00:06:45.615
<v Josh Sparkes>your employee portal,
everyone's being kept kept up to date.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/43-0
00:06:46.055 --> 00:06:48.902
<v Josh Sparkes>Through this new mechanism,
all the way forward,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/43-1
00:06:48.902 --> 00:06:51.807
<v Josh Sparkes>you know that transition piece,
very nice of you,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/43-2
00:06:51.807 --> 00:06:55.002
<v Josh Sparkes>but probably actually to show a good
visual of attack,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/43-3
00:06:55.002 --> 00:06:59.534
<v Josh Sparkes>which shows if you want to receive the
dashboard to give you that confidence.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/43-4
00:06:59.534 --> 00:07:01.335
<v Josh Sparkes>But this is what it looks like.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/44-0
00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:06.663
<v Josh Sparkes>And they can be, you know, nice pictorial.
You can get it by chance, Ross, etcetera.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/44-1
00:07:06.663 --> 00:07:09.878
<v Josh Sparkes>And you can drill down.
The nice thing back there with now is</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/44-2
00:07:09.878 --> 00:07:12.730
<v Josh Sparkes>that, oh gosh,
I've got 7 in my queue and you can just</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/44-3
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.893
<v Josh Sparkes>click on it and open for you.
It's all there for you to see.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/44-4
00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Josh Sparkes>Whereas in e-mail you'll probably have to
transition. OK. I can see that.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/44-5
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.975
<v Josh Sparkes>Then I go in one by one.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/45-0
00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:23.575
<v Josh Sparkes>But we could share that to you.
But thanks Marwin for the.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/47-0
00:07:25.815 --> 00:07:29.895
<v Josh Sparkes>That that in three years absolutely for
the as you change.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/46-0
00:07:25.855 --> 00:07:26.215
<v Marwan Altaie>No worries.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/48-0
00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:35.384
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good.
Are we landing on before we have a great</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/48-1
00:07:35.384 --> 00:07:39.899
<v Josh Sparkes>Ledger account or is that a whole in
itself, a wondering movie?</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/48-2
00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:43.074
<v Josh Sparkes>What this one is,
is that part of the check?</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/48-3
00:07:43.074 --> 00:07:48.788
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just going to just we need to start
for lunch. A half, 12 today I think. Oh,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/48-4
00:07:48.788 --> 00:07:50.975
<v Josh Sparkes>OK. A lunch. I'm just thinking.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/51-0
00:07:51.015 --> 00:07:56.188
<v Josh Sparkes>It might be good to just stay is a good
time for a break. Yeah.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/51-1
00:07:56.188 --> 00:08:01.037
<v Josh Sparkes>If I've got 5 calls with a quick.
All right in measurement.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/49-0
00:07:59.535 --> 00:07:59.855
<v Mark Sedge>When?</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/51-2
00:08:01.037 --> 00:08:06.695
<v Josh Sparkes>That's like with a large station 5 lbs.
Oh, yeah, 10 minutes. 5 past.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/50-0
00:08:01.975 --> 00:08:04.015
<v Mark Sedge>When do you want?
When do you want us back, Josh?</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/53-0
00:08:07.015 --> 00:08:07.975
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. Perfect.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/54-0
00:08:07.415 --> 00:08:08.135
<v Josh Sparkes>That's probably the one.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/56-0
00:08:10.455 --> 00:08:12.655
<v Josh Sparkes>All right. Yeah. Thank you. See,
you're back here.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/57-0
00:08:21.215 --> 00:08:23.535
<v Josh Sparkes>Time is flying to get in when you when
you get into it, isn't.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/59-0
00:08:27.255 --> 00:08:33.294
<v Josh Sparkes>How many were processes on the 25?
Is that what I guess that's what it says</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/59-1
00:08:33.294 --> 00:08:38.618
<v Josh Sparkes>down there? Yeah. I mean,
a lot of them are relating to this as we</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/59-2
00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:39.015
<v Josh Sparkes>said.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/60-0
00:08:42.215 --> 00:08:46.330
<v Josh Sparkes>We've gone. I just, I think good.
We've done the third. Oh, OK. He's hoping.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/60-1
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.217
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm just asking,
just like you've done 2125 up to 71,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/60-2
00:08:49.217 --> 00:08:52.905
<v Josh Sparkes>right. Even that's pretty good thing.
Yeah. You still make it. Look,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/60-3
00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:55.738
<v Josh Sparkes>whatever we're talking about.
And I'm sitting going,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/60-4
00:08:55.738 --> 00:09:00.067
<v Josh Sparkes>are you still talking with the same? Yeah.
It's a big gym. It's a big gym. Yeah,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/60-5
00:09:00.067 --> 00:09:00.655
<v Josh Sparkes>last night.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/61-0
00:09:01.295 --> 00:09:01.815
<v Josh Sparkes>10%.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/62-0
00:09:02.055 --> 00:09:07.561
<v Josh Sparkes>A server afraid and in our head we've got
in. So it's a lot of receipts. OK,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/62-1
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:11.922
<v Josh Sparkes>but this is what we're spending the time
on. But it's there.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/62-2
00:09:11.922 --> 00:09:17.571
<v Josh Sparkes>I'm taking off in my mind that it's a new
transfer. It's an audit, it's query,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/62-3
00:09:17.571 --> 00:09:21.575
<v Josh Sparkes>you know that.
So it doesn't how we sound some of it's.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/63-0
00:09:21.855 --> 00:09:25.346
<v Josh Sparkes>And that's some admin.
It's a little bit simpler things than for</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/63-1
00:09:25.346 --> 00:09:25.615
<v Josh Sparkes>this.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/64-0
00:09:28.975 --> 00:09:34.015
<v Josh Sparkes>That's good. That was perfect. Yeah. No,
no, it's perfect. Yeah. Great.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/65-0
00:09:36.735 --> 00:09:41.587
<v Josh Sparkes>What do you want to tackle next?
Ledger statements, a part of the?</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/65-1
00:09:41.587 --> 00:09:45.643
<v Josh Sparkes>Assuming that's a quickish 1 might be a
big assumption.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/65-2
00:09:45.643 --> 00:09:48.975

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/68-0

00:10:30.495 --> 00:10:35.329
<v Josh Sparkes>England calls it client, so then sorry,
England and Wales,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/69-1
00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:40.982
<v Josh Sparkes>Scotland to get somebody. Yeah.
Trust trust. So both of them for me.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/69-2
00:10:40.982 --> 00:10:46.144

00:10:47.935 --> 00:10:53.116
<v Josh Sparkes>Client and trust percentage was a client.
I don't see why you guys want client</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/70-1
00:10:53.116 --> 00:10:57.116
<v Josh Sparkes>slash trust that mean that's that's
that's been a big point.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/70-2
00:10:57.116 --> 00:11:02.165

opportunity and they'll be like, oh,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/70-3
00:11:02.165 --> 00:11:06.362
<v Josh Sparkes>there's nothing there.
I'm looking for trust and it's not there</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/70-4
00:11:06.362 --> 00:11:07.215

00:11:07.615 --> 00:11:15.119
<v Josh Sparkes>It's people are going to use the
terminology that used to probably</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/71-1
00:11:15.119 --> 00:11:20.271

global.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/71-2
00:11:20.271 --> 00:11:24.975
<v Josh Sparkes>Is there anything no build an example one.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/72-0
00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:33.375
<v Josh Sparkes>But it was just the high level case
management.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/73-0
00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:40.428
<v Josh Sparkes>I would have liked to build out this this
workspace a bit more,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/73-1
00:11:40.428 --> 00:11:42.055
<v Josh Sparkes>but it's pretty basic.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/74-0
00:11:44.215 --> 00:11:47.775

<v Josh Sparkes>Complete.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/78-0
00:12:01.575 --> 00:12:02.055
<v Josh Sparkes>That has to.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/79-0
00:12:21.415 --> 00:12:21.815
<v Josh Sparkes>We have.</v>

00:12:22.735 --> 00:12:26.975
<v Josh Sparkes>We don't. We have lunch or we don't.
We don't have a bit longer.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/81-0

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/81-1
00:12:52.732 --> 00:12:55.335
<v Josh Sparkes>It won't go on charge.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/82-0
00:12:57.575 --> 00:13:01.764
<v Josh Sparkes>Oh, was that now? Oh, I'm so sorry. Hi.

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/82-1
00:13:01.764 --> 00:13:05.657
<v Josh Sparkes>I thought the gentleman.
I thought the gentleman took them and he</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/82-2
00:13:05.657 --> 00:13:08.135
<v Josh Sparkes>didn't take them. They worked from church.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/83-0
00:13:10.495 --> 00:13:11.775
<v Josh Sparkes>What we take to the method?</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/84-0
00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:41.615
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like next door.
It's called absolute roster. Yeah.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/85-0
00:13:42.215 --> 00:13:48.371
<v Josh Sparkes>It's. I feel it's a bit of a strike.
Copy is not secure. It there in mind.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/85-1
00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:54.855
<v Josh Sparkes>I was wondering if you can use some
portion. Yeah, but that one's a good play.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/86-0
00:13:57.615 --> 00:14:01.557
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like there's a little puff thing
that's next to it.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/86-1
00:14:01.557 --> 00:14:05.913
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like they it's like just the it's
not a wall in the hole,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/86-2
00:14:05.913 --> 00:14:10.339
<v Josh Sparkes>but they don't have ceilings.
If they have those traffic pains,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/86-3
00:14:10.339 --> 00:14:13.935
<v Josh Sparkes>I don't think isn't so the place space
are amazing.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/87-0
00:14:14.255 --> 00:14:21.122
<v Josh Sparkes>In Glasgow, if you call,
someone absolutely needs to call you,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/87-1
00:14:21.122 --> 00:14:28.535
<v Josh Sparkes>call someone an absolute.
We're still in Scotland. We need to call.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/89-0
00:14:30.055 --> 00:14:32.415
<v Josh Sparkes>Right. The name.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/90-0
00:14:52.695 --> 00:14:56.628
<v Josh Sparkes>You can get fancy ones that have a little
bit of cheese and cream in the middle,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/90-1
00:14:56.628 --> 00:15:00.368
<v Josh Sparkes>so you like kind of cut it off like a bit,
but it's. Yeah, it's more sponge.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/90-2
00:15:00.368 --> 00:15:04.107
<v Josh Sparkes>It's like it's a very subjective thing
and I'm obviously in the great stuff.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/90-3
00:15:04.107 --> 00:15:07.895
<v Josh Sparkes>Yeah, I think we're winning. Not coffee.
We're not winning. Yeah, I wouldn't.</v>

00:15:09.735 --> 00:15:15.535
<v Josh Sparkes>It's in the money scenario. It's a very.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/92-0
00:15:11.455 --> 00:15:16.939
<v Mark Sedge>Here, here lies. Here lies the here lies.
Here lies the fundamental disappointment</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/92-1
00:15:16.939 --> 00:15:21.299
<v Mark Sedge>of being remote. I can see this.
I can see the food on the table.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/92-2
00:15:21.299 --> 00:15:24.735
<v Mark Sedge>I can hear the conversation.
I can't get any of it.</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/93-0
00:15:26.615 --> 00:15:30.379

<v Josh Sparkes>You can have a click around if you want,
but sure you'd be interested to look what</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/96-2
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.490
<v Josh Sparkes>you can do.
We've only got one example in here,</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/96-3

<v Josh Sparkes>As long as we know that, I mean, you know,
these modern systems pretty much</v>

d04241c4-a4cd-4650-bf83-4ad6e5c72d89/100-1
