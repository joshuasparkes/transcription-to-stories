00:15:21.944 --> 00:15:26.020
I know that there is somebody's workshop
taking place, I think in November,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2057-1
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.648
so there's going to be like a facilities
module,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2057-2
00:15:28.648 --> 00:15:31.384
but it's the plan for asking it to be on
the ITSM.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2097-0
00:15:32.614 --> 00:15:33.694
Yes, well, I put.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2098-0
00:15:34.014 --> 00:15:37.907
Facilities management because you
mentioned it and I thought, oh,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2098-1
00:15:37.907 --> 00:15:42.155
we connect. So that's as we get started,
it's probably that unseen that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2098-2
00:15:42.155 --> 00:15:44.928
differentiation between them anyway.
You know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2098-3
00:15:44.928 --> 00:15:46.934
I don't want to represent connect.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2119-0
00:15:47.744 --> 00:15:51.788
In the incorrect way when that facilities
management as well,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2119-1
00:15:51.788 --> 00:15:56.224
because another science as well,
you know it's connected subset of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2130-0
00:15:56.614 --> 00:15:59.036
Facilities you fall under facilities.
I know you've got it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2130-1
00:15:59.036 --> 00:16:01.014
Facilities manager at the minute going
I've got.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2134-0
00:16:02.744 --> 00:16:03.904
Certainly that workshop.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2172-0
00:16:04.784 --> 00:16:08.307
And then I'm assuming because Kinect will
be on the IP,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2172-1
00:16:08.307 --> 00:16:13.528
is it still easy enough to like transfer
tickets or like can I communicate between

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2172-2
00:16:13.528 --> 00:16:16.485
because you can play a lot too,
you don't get.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2172-3
00:16:16.485 --> 00:16:18.624
It's actually for facilities like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2181-0
00:16:20.074 --> 00:16:24.874
Yes, here. Is he going? Oh, it's a shave.
And that's the only name I remember.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2208-0
00:16:26.624 --> 00:16:29.251
Like they obviously get a lot at the
moment, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2208-1
00:16:29.251 --> 00:16:33.073
saying and to them that is actually for
you know, facilities like or something,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2208-2
00:16:33.073 --> 00:16:34.984
something like that. Don't use names on.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2211-0
00:16:35.504 --> 00:16:36.704
Compensation charts online.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2220-0
00:16:37.624 --> 00:16:39.784
A while back. Yeah, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2229-0
00:16:38.264 --> 00:16:38.624
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2230-0
00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:41.424
When Ashley was on there.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2231-0
00:16:41.424 --> 00:16:42.344
As well, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2232-0
00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:42.214
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2243-0
00:16:45.054 --> 00:16:48.334
An easier way, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2247-0
00:16:48.704 --> 00:16:51.064
It should help, but when you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2295-0
00:16:53.704 --> 00:16:56.433
Well, the same kind of one act.
So you know, like, sorry,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2295-1
00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:58.504
my my wording might be wrong,
but you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2295-2
00:16:58.504 --> 00:17:01.092
like ask people are going to have like a
an HR module.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2295-3
00:17:01.092 --> 00:17:03.304
I don't is that the right thing modjo is
that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2296-0
00:17:03.304 --> 00:17:04.224
The right word and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2297-0
00:17:04.224 --> 00:17:07.530
Then all the other teams are going to be
on is it? Is it NTSM?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2297-1
00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.104
Is that what's called the one?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2299-0
00:17:10.344 --> 00:17:10.664
Aha.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2311-0
00:17:11.704 --> 00:17:12.704
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2312-0
00:17:15.304 --> 00:17:17.504
Yeah. So connect will be on that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2313-0
00:17:17.504 --> 00:17:17.864
1.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2314-0
00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:19.224
On the other, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2323-0
00:17:18.514 --> 00:17:22.258
Yeah,
it's gonna be individual ones each OK?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2323-1
00:17:22.258 --> 00:17:22.674
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2363-0
00:17:22.684 --> 00:17:25.204
You will be able to transfer to customer
scenes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2335-0
00:17:24.704 --> 00:17:25.224
Seats.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2364-0
00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:26.244
Yeah, when you're.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2365-0
00:17:26.244 --> 00:17:30.461
On ServiceNow you can assign and we
didn't get on to assignment groups,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2365-1
00:17:30.461 --> 00:17:34.561
but you can reassign, you know.
Try to think of it that it's not your

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2365-2
00:17:34.561 --> 00:17:37.724
just your swim lane.
It starts there and stops there.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2374-0
00:17:38.504 --> 00:17:40.344
Very powerful and so you can actually as
you said.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2410-0
00:17:41.034 --> 00:17:44.804
I can now transfer facilities.
There's assignment group for them and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2410-1
00:17:44.804 --> 00:17:48.739
that could be automated through your
workflows as you said for managing

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2410-2
00:17:48.739 --> 00:17:53.056
probably getting into more detail here,
but you can manage the room and things

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2410-3
00:17:53.056 --> 00:17:56.554
need to be serviced or broken or that
room to be up to scratch.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2441-0
00:17:57.304 --> 00:18:01.179
You could trigger, you know, she said.
Light bulbs, cables,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2441-1
00:18:01.179 --> 00:18:05.377
catering and that just gets reassigned as
further tasks to them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2441-2
00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:09.704
And you could get that whole transparency
that even though you're.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2469-0
00:18:10.454 --> 00:18:13.587
What we've done,
you can still see that they've actually

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2469-1
00:18:13.587 --> 00:18:16.556
done that fix that you require them to do.
So if you,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2469-2
00:18:16.556 --> 00:18:19.854
if you needed that transparency that
you've got confidence.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2461-0
00:18:19.024 --> 00:18:19.184
<v Mark Sedge>There.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2470-0
00:18:20.354 --> 00:18:21.674
You missed up scratch.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2473-0
00:18:22.024 --> 00:18:24.776
<v Mark Sedge>So yeah,
if I can just jump in a little bit on</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2473-1
00:18:24.776 --> 00:18:27.176
<v Mark Sedge>there.
So just as it would interact with</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2473-2
00:18:27.176 --> 00:18:32.153
<v Mark Sedge>facilities, say for example, if they had,
they lost power to an office or something,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2473-3
00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:34.787
<v Mark Sedge>they'd expect facilities to go in an
action.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2473-4
00:18:34.787 --> 00:18:39.237
<v Mark Sedge>You know that same sort of mechanism
certainly from an instant perspective.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2473-5
00:18:39.237 --> 00:18:41.344
<v Mark Sedge>If something's broken, you'd expect.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2475-0
00:18:41.464 --> 00:18:45.129
<v Mark Sedge>You guys to be able to plug into that
standard process,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2475-1
00:18:45.129 --> 00:18:50.429
<v Mark Sedge>so you would just either through through
redirection of whatever tickets you get</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2475-2
00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:54.617
<v Mark Sedge>or by just creating a ticket directly for
them to go in action.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2475-3
00:18:54.617 --> 00:18:56.384
<v Mark Sedge>There's a number of routes.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2478-0
00:18:56.664 --> 00:18:59.192
<v Mark Sedge>That,
that we would you know that we would</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2478-1
00:18:59.192 --> 00:19:03.543
<v Mark Sedge>follow to enable you to have full
visibility seamless linking between the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2478-2
00:19:03.543 --> 00:19:08.188
<v Mark Sedge>issues that come through you and those
that maybe come back out the other way.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2478-3
00:19:08.188 --> 00:19:11.833
<v Mark Sedge>Quick question for me.
Do you ever do any sort of do you ever</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2478-4
00:19:11.833 --> 00:19:16.184
<v Mark Sedge>get notified by facility say they lost
power to building, do they notify?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2481-0
00:19:16.704 --> 00:19:20.234
<v Mark Sedge>You guys,
as part of that or you know so that you</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2481-1
00:19:20.234 --> 00:19:25.953
<v Mark Sedge>can manage your user community if you're
getting requesting I out looking out as</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2481-2
00:19:25.953 --> 00:19:28.424
<v Mark Sedge>opposed to actions going into them?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2485-0
00:19:29.684 --> 00:19:31.484
But I wouldn't say because usually.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2528-0
00:19:33.024 --> 00:19:36.577
That type of status is quite far fetched
to be fair,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2528-1
00:19:36.577 --> 00:19:41.874
but they do have times where there is
planned outages and they'll let us know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2528-2
00:19:41.874 --> 00:19:47.238
But that's security and it would let us
know to say Operation manager would let

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2528-3
00:19:47.238 --> 00:19:51.664
us know that there is planned maintenance
and this is a scenario.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2538-0
00:19:52.744 --> 00:19:56.464
99%, we've never had anything like this.
It's extreme is that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2537-0
00:19:57.384 --> 00:19:58.304
<v Mark Sedge>Right. OK.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2544-0
00:19:58.544 --> 00:20:00.784
Terms of anything that they're updating.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2561-0
00:20:01.664 --> 00:20:05.334
And things that want to be impacted by
your team,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2561-1
00:20:05.334 --> 00:20:08.784
let us know and then we will make sure we
let.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2562-0
00:20:09.704 --> 00:20:11.224
<v Mark Sedge>OK, cool. Thank you.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2567-0
00:20:13.094 --> 00:20:14.094
Should we just start?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2573-0
00:20:25.964 --> 00:20:27.284
You just refresh it. Let's see.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2576-0
00:20:28.654 --> 00:20:29.694
That's the online one.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2582-0
00:20:30.924 --> 00:20:31.844
On the online.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2585-0
00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.284
The visual URL, sorry.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2596-0
00:20:41.454 --> 00:20:44.069
You know,
that's something like if you just go back

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2596-1
00:20:44.069 --> 00:20:44.974
into the data set.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2606-0
00:20:46.824 --> 00:20:49.504
Into the online you know our teams face.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2607-0
00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:51.144
Yeah, if that's OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2618-0
00:20:52.944 --> 00:20:56.064
So as we're finding it,
maybe you just say.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2647-0
00:20:56.534 --> 00:20:58.254
That differentiation between because.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2629-0
00:20:58.304 --> 00:20:59.664
You put a facility management.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2648-0
00:20:59.734 --> 00:21:03.271
And connect so that I can just ensure,
as you said the right terminology when

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2648-1
00:21:03.271 --> 00:21:05.494
you're thinking I don't want to call
facilities.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2680-0
00:21:06.924 --> 00:21:11.570
That's disconnect and probably it's in.
It's very like maybe you just describe

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2680-1
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:16.333
the why or does it come under facilities
first question or is it separate entity

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2680-2
00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:17.804
in its own right and why?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2706-0
00:21:20.884 --> 00:21:24.138
Yeah,
done in that way for partners that they

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2706-1
00:21:24.138 --> 00:21:29.444
wanted to have a fast track in order to
get things done for them was that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2735-0
00:21:29.174 --> 00:21:35.734
And there was all the service management,
we were probably facilities because all

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2735-1
00:21:35.734 --> 00:21:40.694
the type of process that we had was
example for the engineer,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2735-2
00:21:40.694 --> 00:21:43.734
then security was brought in to share.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2769-0
00:21:44.524 --> 00:21:50.941
Essentially this year and then because of
the limitations Cheryl had within our

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2769-1
00:21:50.941 --> 00:21:57.038
team, I think we had to share it.
So I think this is where that like we can

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2769-2
00:21:57.038 --> 00:21:59.284
because we think with share.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2810-0
00:22:01.234 --> 00:22:07.286
One part of it is for NGN and the next
part so we can see that the implies what

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2810-1
00:22:07.286 --> 00:22:12.203
sorry engineering right,
essentially in the pure. So All in all,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2810-2
00:22:12.203 --> 00:22:15.834
which will cleaners know that want to
security.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2821-0
00:22:17.444 --> 00:22:19.284
And even the reception team didn't want
to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2832-0
00:22:20.044 --> 00:22:23.204
I cannot show that was.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2840-0
00:22:21.244 --> 00:22:25.545
Yeah. So they wanted to e-mail.
They didn't want any queries being

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2840-1
00:22:25.545 --> 00:22:26.444
generated, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2855-0
00:22:26.734 --> 00:22:29.211
So again,
I wasn't part of that conversation,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2855-1
00:22:29.211 --> 00:22:32.174
but then so it was only engineering and
us, so we had.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2868-0
00:22:35.294 --> 00:22:38.873
A share well,
so I think they keep the shareable

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2868-1
00:22:38.873 --> 00:22:40.334
facilities and then.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2878-0
00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:44.334
They said not everybody within it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2887-0
00:22:44.264 --> 00:22:44.624
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2888-0
00:22:44.944 --> 00:22:48.264
Yeah.
So that from the way we're in the shared.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2902-0
00:22:49.924 --> 00:22:55.164
Facilities one right, but be fair,
we we don't want to be separate.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2940-0
00:22:57.364 --> 00:22:59.275
Yeah.
Is that how you don't feel that you need

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2916-0
00:22:57.884 --> 00:22:58.364
We.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2940-1
00:22:59.275 --> 00:22:59.844
to be on with?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2941-0
00:22:59.844 --> 00:23:01.364
Them like because I think.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2942-0
00:23:01.764 --> 00:23:06.284
John, maybe I should a question.
I went back and you were you were.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2945-0
00:23:05.864 --> 00:23:07.064
Yeah, I'm feeling.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2943-0
00:23:06.284 --> 00:23:07.404
Refusing don't need to be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2946-0
00:23:07.664 --> 00:23:07.784
Eat.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2947-0
00:23:07.984 --> 00:23:09.104
No, there's not. No, we can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2953-0
00:23:09.844 --> 00:23:12.844
Essentially just shell tickets. Be direct,
yeah, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2970-0
00:23:19.764 --> 00:23:22.462
Like 19? Yeah,
even though the contract bills,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2970-1
00:23:22.462 --> 00:23:23.324
they should be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2987-0
00:23:25.884 --> 00:23:26.964
Right. OK. OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2988-0
00:23:27.724 --> 00:23:30.844
Do you have a lot of communication with
other ask teams like?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/2989-0
00:23:31.324 --> 00:23:32.364
If it's going back and forth.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3004-0
00:23:34.284 --> 00:23:38.852
It's real.
It was slightly different just because we

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3004-1
00:23:38.852 --> 00:23:41.524
were focused on fixing problem.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3007-0
00:23:42.764 --> 00:23:43.684
We share essentially.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3017-0
00:23:44.964 --> 00:23:48.004
Not once here. Well,
but we speak to the deception. London.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3018-0
00:23:48.004 --> 00:23:48.324
Team.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3040-0
00:23:50.084 --> 00:23:55.286
Catering team in London and we speak to
the AB team. I mean,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3040-1
00:23:55.286 --> 00:23:59.124
physically is not for e-mail.
Yes teams and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3059-0
00:24:00.804 --> 00:24:02.164
More, but none of them so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3060-0
00:24:03.324 --> 00:24:03.724
Like and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3061-0
00:24:04.404 --> 00:24:08.044
All UK based Australia don't have the
equivalent.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3089-0
00:24:10.324 --> 00:24:15.792
But they have they have in terms of the
Ask Complera, you mean or just us.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3089-1
00:24:15.792 --> 00:24:20.240
So for example Sydney,
they have in house but they they team

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3089-2
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.844
they have Katyn, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3111-0
00:24:22.584 --> 00:24:23.424
Right. I don't know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3112-0
00:24:23.704 --> 00:24:31.654
If they are all enhanced or just TV is,
but that's receptions are outsourced

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3112-1
00:24:31.654 --> 00:24:32.584
security.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3119-0
00:24:34.124 --> 00:24:36.204
And sourced kittens outsourced.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3149-0
00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:40.684
And I was.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3150-0
00:24:40.964 --> 00:24:44.988
Just thinking about managing it as a
service to have full transparency as

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3150-1
00:24:44.988 --> 00:24:47.108
chance,
do you know if you think about

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3150-2
00:24:47.108 --> 00:24:51.404
roombooking in Australia that happens,
doesn't it? You know, who manages that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3167-0
00:24:52.794 --> 00:24:57.749
So essentially we managed their own
bookings of future on the day as

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3167-1
00:24:57.749 --> 00:24:59.114
reception, so like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3172-0
00:25:00.804 --> 00:25:02.324
Here or London?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3186-0
00:25:06.764 --> 00:25:07.724
Yeah. So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3187-0
00:25:08.204 --> 00:25:10.564
Can we get a rerout to a team?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3188-0
00:25:10.564 --> 00:25:12.964
That's not on ServiceNow.
How did that work?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3220-0
00:25:13.954 --> 00:25:17.175
For for CDBG and so on the same day
bookings, if it's future,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3198-0
00:25:15.084 --> 00:25:15.564
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3220-1
00:25:17.175 --> 00:25:19.617
so say I wanted to put something for
tomorrow,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3220-2
00:25:19.617 --> 00:25:22.994
would I come to you or would I right, OK,
so literally same day.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3240-0
00:25:23.564 --> 00:25:27.108
So that we just did.
Then we'd have to go to reception to book

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3240-1
00:25:27.108 --> 00:25:28.684
this room. But you actually.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3241-0
00:25:29.164 --> 00:25:30.404
Not classical, no, but classical.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3242-0
00:25:30.404 --> 00:25:31.724
Is definitely that classical stuff.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3255-0
00:25:32.974 --> 00:25:35.014
In London, yes. You want anything?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3256-0
00:25:35.134 --> 00:25:35.894
On the day.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3257-0
00:25:36.134 --> 00:25:36.254
In.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3253-0
00:25:36.404 --> 00:25:37.284
What's the reception?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3258-0
00:25:37.454 --> 00:25:38.294
And in Glasgow.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3281-0
00:25:39.854 --> 00:25:43.458
For anything future and on the same day.
And it's interesting,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3278-0
00:25:41.684 --> 00:25:41.884
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3281-1
00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:47.291
conversation is obviously want to get to
Apple going and standing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3281-2
00:25:47.291 --> 00:25:49.294
You know what we can do, I suppose.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3295-0
00:25:51.014 --> 00:25:55.734
Probably what I'm getting is self-service,
so why people can't book their own rooms?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3310-0
00:25:57.934 --> 00:26:03.794
This is a conversation I don't know.
We want to talk about later in the day

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3310-1
00:26:03.794 --> 00:26:05.414
with integration, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3312-0
00:26:04.054 --> 00:26:04.254
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3333-0
00:26:05.724 --> 00:26:09.524
I've already started the conversation
going where intimation you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3334-0
00:26:09.524 --> 00:26:13.051
Mentioned Mark you.
I wasn't on the call on Friday,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3334-1
00:26:13.051 --> 00:26:15.764
was it MRI for scanning company like he?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3351-0
00:26:17.654 --> 00:26:24.881
In London and eventually every office in
Ashers are going to have a thing called

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3351-1
00:26:24.881 --> 00:26:25.774
NTR Rooms.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3383-0
00:26:26.904 --> 00:26:30.224
Which essentially means that you can send
teams like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3384-0
00:26:30.264 --> 00:26:30.864
Straight to that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3385-0
00:26:30.864 --> 00:26:34.929
Room. Yes. So again,
it does streamlining process,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3385-1
00:26:34.929 --> 00:26:41.067
removing the manual steps or even any
human interaction problem that we have

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3385-2
00:26:41.067 --> 00:26:41.944
for London.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3414-0
00:26:42.724 --> 00:26:45.418
Because they have actually have the NDTR
rooms.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3414-1
00:26:45.418 --> 00:26:48.001
Is that the systems does speak to each
other,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3414-2
00:26:48.001 --> 00:26:52.604
so when they create a teams link and they
see I want this room, we need to check.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3444-0
00:26:51.504 --> 00:26:51.744
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3445-0
00:26:52.664 --> 00:26:56.340
Two systems,
so we need to check a note calendar and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3445-1
00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.848
then consider the MRI.
Sorry to make sure the rooms align is the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3445-2
00:27:00.848 --> 00:27:05.704
correct meeting and that the team was
like is on the correct meeting.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3468-0
00:27:10.604 --> 00:27:15.201
So what the MRI contract,
we have integration in it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3468-1
00:27:15.201 --> 00:27:18.324
So I've had conversations to see is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3509-0
00:27:20.604 --> 00:27:24.573
8 hours integration.
That's how long it's going to take. Very,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3509-1
00:27:24.573 --> 00:27:28.982
very cheap because we already have
contract and it works via outlook.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3509-2
00:27:28.982 --> 00:27:33.581
So it's just a plug in. Yeah.
And then essentially the form is on teams,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3509-3
00:27:33.581 --> 00:27:38.684
yeah, sorry on outlook. So now that line,
what do you need in terms of catering?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3542-0
00:27:39.314 --> 00:27:43.998
Yeah, Leo, attendees,
teams link and then they book it that way

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3542-1
00:27:43.998 --> 00:27:47.804
through to us for approval because I
managed space.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3542-2
00:27:47.804 --> 00:27:53.074
It's going to then approve that no emails.
So it wouldn't come through.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3571-0
00:27:54.324 --> 00:27:55.004
So it would.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3572-0
00:27:55.004 --> 00:28:01.866
Be be at Outlook and again it's just
because reception have access to MRI.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3572-1
00:28:01.866 --> 00:28:09.004
I've been seeing have access to MRI to
book rooms and the LND department, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3625-0
00:28:09.934 --> 00:28:14.559
There's more than one team have access to
put rooms and we have this two.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3625-1
00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:19.748
We think anything that's booked in jumbo,
anything smooth changed and updated will

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3625-2
00:28:19.748 --> 00:28:24.936
be deflected and that host calendar, yeah.
And I know service now have hundreds of

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3625-3
00:28:24.936 --> 00:28:29.374
you know as they've expanded their
portfolio over the years all these.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3626-0
00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:30.334
Club cases are.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3638-0
00:28:30.724 --> 00:28:34.324
Direct that we'll have an action to have
a look at that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3685-0
00:28:34.914 --> 00:28:37.874
Direct integration because it just sounds
like there's a lot.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3686-0
00:28:37.874 --> 00:28:38.194
Of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3655-0
00:28:38.804 --> 00:28:40.804
It's not approved yet.
It's not approved yet.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3687-0
00:28:39.114 --> 00:28:41.354
Back and forth so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3688-0
00:28:42.154 --> 00:28:44.674
The process we have to manually do it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3689-0
00:28:44.674 --> 00:28:48.529
On every OK.
And when that's a project that you're

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3689-1
00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:52.535
working through, yeah,
assessing from the NT albums,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3689-2
00:28:52.535 --> 00:28:53.594
which are all.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3693-0
00:28:54.974 --> 00:28:55.134
Been.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3702-0
00:28:57.774 --> 00:28:58.574
Refreshed so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3703-0
00:28:58.574 --> 00:29:00.214
They're wanting to know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3721-0
00:29:05.444 --> 00:29:06.084
There's a lot.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3722-0
00:29:06.084 --> 00:29:10.364
Of potential as well so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3751-0
00:29:11.964 --> 00:29:17.932
Somebody who can just press that button
and that so that we're looking at the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3751-1
00:29:17.932 --> 00:29:22.369
integration as well,
just to help solve any human errors,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3751-2
00:29:22.369 --> 00:29:23.364
any mistakes?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3752-0
00:29:23.644 --> 00:29:25.004
Joining codes that they shouldn't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3755-0
00:29:26.764 --> 00:29:28.084
Yeah. And obviously.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3762-0
00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:30.594
What shows on the meeting invites?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3775-0
00:29:32.764 --> 00:29:33.604
So that's why.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3776-0
00:29:34.164 --> 00:29:38.444
It's not fully went live yet,
still looking at all the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3779-0
00:29:40.724 --> 00:29:41.244
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3804-0
00:29:41.684 --> 00:29:44.244
Yeah. And presumably for the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3805-0
00:29:45.164 --> 00:29:48.844
Client ones you know,
they've got to feel confident that their.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3806-0
00:29:48.844 --> 00:29:50.444
Confidentiality. Would that mean?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3832-0
00:29:52.564 --> 00:29:55.084
Is dealt with almost exclusively.
Do you know?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3833-0
00:29:55.284 --> 00:29:59.340
What the figured problem is women's
change so much in London,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3833-1
00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:03.004
so we need to speak with that and get the
processes so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3837-0
00:30:04.194 --> 00:30:05.834
They can change 10 times.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3840-0
00:30:07.364 --> 00:30:08.004
Up to 10 times.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3842-0
00:30:09.194 --> 00:30:09.554
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3853-0
00:30:12.124 --> 00:30:22.484
Who comes first etc.
And essentially hierarchy.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3884-0
00:30:24.644 --> 00:30:27.237
Requesting like you know,
I've seen another legal firms,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3884-1
00:30:27.237 --> 00:30:29.239
we have the same issue.
We infer my bucket.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3884-2
00:30:29.239 --> 00:30:32.333
It's usually because there's something
that works better in a room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3884-3
00:30:32.333 --> 00:30:35.564
This is usually there's something about
if there's a fight for A room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3917-0
00:30:36.754 --> 00:30:40.582
Or a preference for a roommate,
because I don't know the audio is better,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3917-1
00:30:40.582 --> 00:30:44.566
the layout is better, it's more spacious,
or there's more light in the room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3917-2
00:30:44.566 --> 00:30:45.394
I never find it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3918-0
00:30:45.394 --> 00:30:46.074
Because.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3919-0
00:30:46.394 --> 00:30:48.874
That's my room. You know,
it's not like Sheldon's spot.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3930-0
00:30:52.294 --> 00:30:53.494
So is this stuff that's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3931-0
00:30:53.494 --> 00:30:54.094
Lacking in the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3932-0
00:30:54.094 --> 00:30:55.974
Other rooms that no, no. So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3945-0
00:30:57.614 --> 00:31:00.294
Very very small. So OK, so there's a.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3946-0
00:31:00.294 --> 00:31:01.054
Brief opinion, OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3947-0
00:31:02.254 --> 00:31:04.014
But one of the partners?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3969-0
00:31:07.334 --> 00:31:12.839
So we've got to move everything that's in
that certain room if you want.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3969-1
00:31:12.839 --> 00:31:17.214
So give me 5 Jenkins.
Paul Jenkins only sent to room 411.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3973-0
00:31:18.144 --> 00:31:19.944
We look to everything.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/3976-0
00:31:21.654 --> 00:31:21.774
And.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4015-0
00:31:23.454 --> 00:31:24.254
So it's the changes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4016-0
00:31:24.414 --> 00:31:27.672
I mean, Mark,
can you probably interject this,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4016-1
00:31:27.672 --> 00:31:31.070
but you can have sort of a room set up
you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4016-2
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:36.894
so room name you know so some of that can
be systemized where there's this metrics.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4033-0
00:31:39.414 --> 00:31:44.629
It will all to assign a room for people
based on what rooms they like East facing

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4033-1
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:45.774
West facing light.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4045-0
00:31:46.524 --> 00:31:49.950
That table round table, not square tech,
whatever their purpose is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4045-1
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.764
I understand that there is probably.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4054-0
00:31:53.334 --> 00:31:54.854
Their preferences, as you said, it's not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4084-0
00:31:55.004 --> 00:31:59.154
It's not their room, but it's their room.
I don't care, but that that sort of thing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4060-0
00:31:57.024 --> 00:31:58.224
Yes, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4084-1
00:31:59.154 --> 00:32:02.768
You probably over the year could see this
person was always in that room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4084-2
00:32:02.768 --> 00:32:06.284
Not saying that should be the way forward,
but we could certainly look.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4086-0
00:32:08.404 --> 00:32:08.924
Primary.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4100-0
00:32:10.644 --> 00:32:14.324
List where if they want to go to rooms,
it's defaulted to them for example.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4108-0
00:32:14.534 --> 00:32:16.134
Hey. Oh, it's time. It's not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4107-0
00:32:16.044 --> 00:32:16.244
Available.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4109-0
00:32:16.494 --> 00:32:17.414
This is the problem.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4135-0
00:32:18.324 --> 00:32:21.739
Last minutes,
other people got it and then we're moving

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4135-1
00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:24.484
people out into it.
That's why we give them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4136-0
00:32:24.604 --> 00:32:26.759
Yeah.
And I suppose there is that modelling

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4136-1
00:32:26.759 --> 00:32:27.004
good.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4137-0
00:32:27.004 --> 00:32:28.764
Behaviour of you know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4150-0
00:32:29.824 --> 00:32:33.762
Rooms are neutral and then,
but I completely understand that actually

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4150-1
00:32:33.762 --> 00:32:34.944
there is a hierarchy.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4156-0
00:32:34.284 --> 00:32:35.844
Are there rules we can put?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4168-0
00:32:36.234 --> 00:32:40.415
You find that the exactly right.
So to get these groups right?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4168-1
00:32:40.415 --> 00:32:42.274
So this is what I can do so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4176-0
00:32:46.324 --> 00:32:49.604
There are no known 4040 have accepted.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4181-0
00:32:51.324 --> 00:32:51.844
Of course, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4213-0
00:32:52.474 --> 00:32:52.954
I'd love to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4214-0
00:32:52.954 --> 00:32:53.434
Put those in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4215-0
00:32:53.434 --> 00:32:55.800
Place,
but is there ones where we can say we

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4215-1
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.114
know there's a hierarchy and I think,
Mark?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4216-0
00:32:58.114 --> 00:33:00.757
Can help with this.
That's what we're just saying about the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4216-1
00:33:00.757 --> 00:33:03.621
skills matrix that you can if it if they
need that room. Mm-hmm.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4216-2
00:33:03.621 --> 00:33:04.634
You'll be auto alerted.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4236-0
00:33:04.484 --> 00:33:10.044
Yeah, it's not like an actual.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4237-0
00:33:05.494 --> 00:33:08.777
Of the structure of move, you know,
there was the notification.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4237-1
00:33:08.777 --> 00:33:10.214
That's the power of it, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4238-0
00:33:10.104 --> 00:33:15.064
<v Mark Sedge>If facilities if facilities manage their
buildings and their assets and you</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4238-1
00:33:15.064 --> 00:33:19.958
<v Mark Sedge>actually track rooms as assets because
you can do that in enterprise asset</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4238-2
00:33:19.958 --> 00:33:22.699
<v Mark Sedge>module,
then you start to sort of have an</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4238-3
00:33:22.699 --> 00:33:25.635
<v Mark Sedge>association with that asset regularly
users.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4238-4
00:33:25.635 --> 00:33:27.984
<v Mark Sedge>The thing for me though is that the.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4242-0
00:33:28.984 --> 00:33:33.003
<v Mark Sedge>There's sort of a financial justification.
If it's someone's just personal</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4242-1
00:33:33.003 --> 00:33:35.683
<v Mark Sedge>preference,
but it causes you guys failure demand</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4242-2
00:33:35.683 --> 00:33:39.166
<v Mark Sedge>because the moment they go,
I want that room and if it's already</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4242-3
00:33:39.166 --> 00:33:42.971
<v Mark Sedge>booked, you can't go. Sorry,
it's booked here, have an equivalent one.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4242-4
00:33:42.971 --> 00:33:47.419
<v Mark Sedge>If the technology within that room's the
same and if they kick off that for me and</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4242-5
00:33:47.419 --> 00:33:48.544
<v Mark Sedge>that causes you like.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4246-0
00:33:48.624 --> 00:33:52.405
<v Mark Sedge>1015 moves of all these other people
shuffling around for me,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4246-1
00:33:52.405 --> 00:33:56.248
<v Mark Sedge>I think that's something that
organizationally the leadership,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4246-2
00:33:56.248 --> 00:34:00.456
<v Mark Sedge>seniors need to think about,
whether that's something that they want</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4246-3
00:34:00.456 --> 00:34:05.396
<v Mark Sedge>to promote because what you permit you
promote and the issue for me here is that</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4245-0
00:34:01.744 --> 00:34:01.904
None.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4246-4
00:34:05.396 --> 00:34:08.384
<v Mark Sedge>you, you guys,
you guys in essence do something.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4248-0
00:34:08.504 --> 00:34:14.094
<v Mark Sedge>Multitude of times because of that
behavioural pattern that is permitted.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4248-1
00:34:14.094 --> 00:34:19.834
<v Mark Sedge>So it might be actually that we we look
towards you know the organisational</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4248-2
00:34:19.834 --> 00:34:24.064
<v Mark Sedge>change team or or up to the leadership to
say actually.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4252-0
00:34:24.384 --> 00:34:27.290
<v Mark Sedge>Is this the right thing to be permitting?
And if it is,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4252-1
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.923
<v Mark Sedge>and if someone wants that room,
then actually what you do is you say,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4252-2
00:34:30.923 --> 00:34:34.244
<v Mark Sedge>well, you're going to reserve that room,
it's allocated to you,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4252-3
00:34:34.244 --> 00:34:38.136
<v Mark Sedge>but you're going to pay for it, right?
So there's other things you can do,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4252-4
00:34:38.136 --> 00:34:41.561
<v Mark Sedge>albeit wooden dollars. But, you know,
there's a number of things.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4252-5
00:34:41.561 --> 00:34:44.104
<v Mark Sedge>So if facilities track the room and the
room is.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4255-0
00:34:44.264 --> 00:34:48.490
<v Mark Sedge>Assigned to an individual because they
always want that room, you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4255-1
00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:51.718
<v Mark Sedge>ready for them.
Then you basically just allocate it to</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4255-2
00:34:51.718 --> 00:34:55.357
<v Mark Sedge>them and and you know,
they sort of take ownership of it at a</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4255-3
00:34:55.357 --> 00:34:59.935
<v Mark Sedge>fee. Just, you know, I'm getting at.
I think there's things that we should be</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4255-4
00:34:59.935 --> 00:35:02.224
<v Mark Sedge>able to push for you because it's just.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4295-0
00:35:00.704 --> 00:35:04.744
I don't think that would work because
they.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4296-0
00:35:04.944 --> 00:35:08.104
Don't use it regularly enough.
It's just maybe last minute.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4273-0
00:35:07.994 --> 00:35:08.234
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4297-0
00:35:08.344 --> 00:35:10.104
And then we're having to like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4298-0
00:35:10.384 --> 00:35:13.431
Lock back other people who can use the
room on a day-to-day basis just because

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4298-1
00:35:13.431 --> 00:35:13.624
they.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4299-0
00:35:13.624 --> 00:35:14.224
Want to use it once?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4300-0
00:35:14.224 --> 00:35:15.704
A month that wouldn't work.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4304-0
00:35:16.494 --> 00:35:17.534
Right. So I'll just give you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4308-0
00:35:16.744 --> 00:35:19.455
<v Mark Sedge>So, so therefore, so therefore,
if it won't work,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4308-1
00:35:19.455 --> 00:35:23.412
<v Mark Sedge>therefore they if you give them an
equivalent room that's got all of the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4308-2
00:35:23.412 --> 00:35:26.719
<v Mark Sedge>right facilities in,
they should just suck it up and use the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4308-3
00:35:26.719 --> 00:35:30.784
<v Mark Sedge>room rather than you have to move person
X, then person Y and then person.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4314-0
00:35:31.134 --> 00:35:32.774
That is, that is that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4315-0
00:35:34.424 --> 00:35:37.504
<v Mark Sedge>Well, we should be challenged. You should.
We should use this opportunity to</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4315-1
00:35:37.504 --> 00:35:37.904
<v Mark Sedge>challenge.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4320-0
00:35:38.334 --> 00:35:38.614
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4331-0
00:35:38.534 --> 00:35:40.294
Well, would you know what that is?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4332-0
00:35:40.734 --> 00:35:43.424
A good opportunity.
It's not better not come from me because

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4332-1
00:35:43.424 --> 00:35:44.174
we've tried this.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4345-0
00:35:44.204 --> 00:35:48.204
Yeah.
Last year we found out the higher part of

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4341-0
00:35:45.774 --> 00:35:45.814
I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4345-1
00:35:48.204 --> 00:35:50.204
London who wish to book.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4375-0
00:35:52.534 --> 00:35:57.497
And for whatever reason and our higher
partners is I need the room from my

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4355-0
00:35:55.574 --> 00:35:55.894
Let's see.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4375-1
00:35:57.497 --> 00:36:02.923
flight. You can't have it for your client.
So that's spiralled to leading to this

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4375-2
00:36:02.923 --> 00:36:03.254
part.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4379-0
00:36:05.134 --> 00:36:05.814
Partner one.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4388-0
00:36:05.654 --> 00:36:09.602
Partner one,
the lower partner spiralling site.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4388-1
00:36:09.602 --> 00:36:11.494
This massive e-mail to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4400-0
00:36:13.414 --> 00:36:17.654
Office London management partner to see
lesson that we put procedures in place.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4406-0
00:36:18.234 --> 00:36:19.994
And client needs come first.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4421-0
00:36:21.534 --> 00:36:26.094
I'd even remember the structures client
meet ends interviews pro bono.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4422-0
00:36:26.554 --> 00:36:26.834
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4429-0
00:36:30.434 --> 00:36:31.074
That's like, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4458-0
00:36:31.774 --> 00:36:35.403
Entertainment associate decline,
but maybe that's best spoken,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4458-1
00:36:35.403 --> 00:36:38.802
Miss Katrina. Maybe.
But it was like it's a fear and those

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4458-2
00:36:38.802 --> 00:36:42.374
clients. So yeah, we need that assurance.
So we did try that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4472-0
00:36:43.494 --> 00:36:47.580
It went straight to the higher the
highest person in London and it came back

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4472-1
00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.854
saying first come first.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4515-0
00:36:52.204 --> 00:36:55.568
And So what I said to the team was I said
what service?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4515-1
00:36:55.568 --> 00:36:58.632
Now we want to cut out the middleman,
which is us,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4515-2
00:36:58.632 --> 00:37:03.438
where the room availability comes in.
Yeah. So we would suggest that, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4515-3
00:37:03.438 --> 00:37:07.644
what change the hierarchy. You can go.
You can. You can challenge it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4517-0
00:37:08.494 --> 00:37:08.574
Now.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4562-0
00:37:10.774 --> 00:37:13.994
As you said,
there could be some rooms that would take

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4523-0
00:37:11.824 --> 00:37:12.184
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4562-1
00:37:13.994 --> 00:37:17.214
this room. For example,
you don't just have. You know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4562-2
00:37:17.214 --> 00:37:21.019
maybe we could categorise the type of
meeting that, as you said,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4562-3
00:37:21.019 --> 00:37:24.942
the clients training you know and that's
probably where it starts.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4562-4
00:37:24.942 --> 00:37:27.694
You've got we know the portfolio of the
rooms.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4599-0
00:37:28.124 --> 00:37:30.730
OK,
last year and monthly and you can sort to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4599-1
00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:34.754
set set some rules that this meeting room
can only be for the clients.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4599-2
00:37:34.754 --> 00:37:36.964
What this meeting room can only be for?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4592-0
00:37:36.364 --> 00:37:37.004
I think you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4593-0
00:37:37.364 --> 00:37:38.724
Know something that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4600-0
00:37:38.804 --> 00:37:39.164
Now.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4627-0
00:37:40.324 --> 00:37:43.546
We have because we have a lot of internal
trainings that because the client and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4627-1
00:37:43.546 --> 00:37:46.164
that walls around us moving a lot of
their interest to feel the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4628-0
00:37:46.164 --> 00:37:47.964
Client and so they weren't allowed on the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4629-0
00:37:47.964 --> 00:37:50.564
4th floor. If we could do that, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4671-0
00:37:50.804 --> 00:37:56.164
It's it's really,
really different from so, but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4672-0
00:37:56.484 --> 00:38:00.043
That's a good place to start because you
can start to categorise your as.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4662-0
00:37:57.144 --> 00:38:00.984
Yeah, yeah, she's not. But yeah,
one question.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4672-1
00:38:00.043 --> 00:38:03.939
I think Mark alluded to is that it seems
as an asset and you start to categorise

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4672-2
00:38:03.939 --> 00:38:04.084
it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4715-0
00:38:04.894 --> 00:38:08.053
So it has a high value. Again,
we don't speak it up term,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4715-1
00:38:08.053 --> 00:38:10.558
but it has a high value client like you
know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4715-2
00:38:10.558 --> 00:38:14.807
I'd quite like to sit in here some days
just to get a bit of space for for my

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4715-3
00:38:14.807 --> 00:38:17.857
emails, but no W can't,
but it does set those rules of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4715-4
00:38:17.857 --> 00:38:20.254
This is the purpose of this room,
you know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4741-0
00:38:20.924 --> 00:38:23.986
It's it's a tool, isn't it?
So you're using this room for that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4741-1
00:38:23.986 --> 00:38:24.764
particular tool.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4742-0
00:38:24.764 --> 00:38:29.110
That is really good one. If not,
because not name and names but as a

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4742-1
00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:30.244
partner in London.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4751-0
00:38:30.814 --> 00:38:34.414
Just just, I'll let you know,
maybe just have a balance.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4752-0
00:38:34.654 --> 00:38:35.054
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4782-0
00:38:35.654 --> 00:38:39.425
Exactly so. So yes,
because he likes the atmosphere of that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4782-1
00:38:39.425 --> 00:38:40.054
room, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4783-0
00:38:40.054 --> 00:38:43.294
He needs to be on his own when he's
Saturday's lunch, even though we.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4784-0
00:38:43.294 --> 00:38:46.854
Have a room in London for lunch for the
partners.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4791-0
00:38:49.014 --> 00:38:51.854
Famous is the opportunity because NFS
Computer says no.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4822-0
00:38:53.454 --> 00:38:56.518
That's a very good place to start.
If we could, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4822-1
00:38:56.518 --> 00:38:59.107
we know all the room numbers,
but they're fixed.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4801-0
00:38:56.584 --> 00:38:56.944
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4822-2
00:38:59.107 --> 00:39:03.070
They don't move and we can start to
categorise them. And then as you said,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4817-0
00:39:02.904 --> 00:39:03.184
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4822-3
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:04.814
let the system be the gatekeeper.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4826-0
00:39:05.304 --> 00:39:10.777
<v Mark Sedge>I've also I've I've also seen if it helps,
some organisations will do it via the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4824-0
00:39:05.364 --> 00:39:06.084
Not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4826-1
00:39:10.777 --> 00:39:14.290
<v Mark Sedge>invitees,
so if you've got 12 invitees on your your</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4826-2
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.263
<v Mark Sedge>list,
it'll automatically move forwards the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4826-3
00:39:17.263 --> 00:39:21.384
<v Mark Sedge>rooms that have the 12 seats.
So if there's only two of you.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4829-0
00:39:21.584 --> 00:39:25.632
<v Mark Sedge>And you try and book a 24 seater room or
whatever it is you.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4829-1
00:39:25.632 --> 00:39:29.215
<v Mark Sedge>You just won't even see it as being
available to you.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4829-2
00:39:29.215 --> 00:39:34.257
<v Mark Sedge>It would only bring forward those
appropriate to your now the challenge you</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4829-3
00:39:34.257 --> 00:39:39.831
<v Mark Sedge>have is obviously if if as a user of that
system you suddenly invite another couple</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4829-4
00:39:39.831 --> 00:39:41.224
<v Mark Sedge>of people, then it's.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4835-0
00:39:41.304 --> 00:39:45.226
<v Mark Sedge>Down to you to restructure,
because if you don't say I've got four</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4835-1
00:39:45.226 --> 00:39:47.977
<v Mark Sedge>people,
what you want the system to say is the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4835-2
00:39:47.977 --> 00:39:51.664
<v Mark Sedge>room you've got isn't appropriate.
Here's here's some options.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4834-0
00:39:51.104 --> 00:39:51.584
Yeah, I mean.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4835-3
00:39:51.664 --> 00:39:56.346
<v Mark Sedge>So we would we would need to be clever in
terms of how we shape that and how we</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4835-4
00:39:56.346 --> 00:39:57.224
<v Mark Sedge>structure that.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4836-0
00:39:57.664 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Mark Sedge>But that would prevent some of those
folks who are just a single invitee book</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4836-1
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.104
<v Mark Sedge>in A room.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4856-0
00:40:03.804 --> 00:40:07.587
Yeah.
So we could start with category of room,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4856-1
00:40:07.587 --> 00:40:10.324
a capacity of room, you know, CB4.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4886-0
00:40:09.394 --> 00:40:09.874
Do we have?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4887-0
00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:12.153
Like have dedicated like training or like
422.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4887-1
00:40:12.153 --> 00:40:15.886
So like say if people are saying it's for
training I think you don't see the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4887-2
00:40:15.886 --> 00:40:17.874
availability all that room and that fees.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4888-0
00:40:17.874 --> 00:40:20.816
Up and it's not long before.
That's the move training.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4888-1
00:40:20.816 --> 00:40:22.314
That's the room and you can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4921-0
00:40:23.094 --> 00:40:24.774
Have the layouts be probably laughing at.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4899-0
00:40:23.554 --> 00:40:24.314
At the morning.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4922-0
00:40:24.774 --> 00:40:26.094
The time and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4923-0
00:40:26.094 --> 00:40:28.871
Other stories,
but we'll just we'll just for we've

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4923-1
00:40:28.871 --> 00:40:33.174
actually just returned 422 to the actual
central booking system after a fight.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4930-0
00:40:35.004 --> 00:40:37.444
Because it's one of the more softer rooms
again.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4934-0
00:40:38.134 --> 00:40:39.254
The workshop that we were.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4936-0
00:40:41.384 --> 00:40:44.304
Yeah. So we have taken that back again.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4945-0
00:40:45.854 --> 00:40:47.974
Just because there's more approved this
is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4956-0
00:40:50.974 --> 00:40:54.294
Can you look music stone or like,
what is the appetite for external?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4957-0
00:40:51.954 --> 00:40:54.514
Do you know?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4996-0
00:40:56.214 --> 00:40:58.712
I know it's cost,
but then if you know that like so,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4996-1
00:40:58.712 --> 00:41:01.777
we've got a similar issue and especially
London being expensive,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4996-2
00:41:01.777 --> 00:41:04.134
I don't think you're running training
every week.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4997-0
00:41:04.414 --> 00:41:05.174
If I'm honest, but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4998-0
00:41:05.454 --> 00:41:06.134
If you're running.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4999-0
00:41:06.134 --> 00:41:08.614
Training. Let's say once 1/4 per key.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/4992-0
00:41:08.324 --> 00:41:08.644
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5000-0
00:41:09.374 --> 00:41:10.214
To save.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5009-0
00:41:12.134 --> 00:41:13.894
I don't know have a headset so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5011-0
00:41:13.934 --> 00:41:15.134
Yes. What is the?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5059-0
00:41:17.014 --> 00:41:20.497
Same time. Yeah, the problem.
So there's maybe like four or five teams

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5059-1
00:41:20.497 --> 00:41:24.225
running away in between 12:00 and 1:00
and they're all over inflating their

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5059-2
00:41:24.225 --> 00:41:26.580
numbers,
so they'll say it's 30 people and they

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5059-3
00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:27.414
can't show up or.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5060-0
00:41:27.414 --> 00:41:30.817
Maybe it's mark in your homework. No,
you do the check on it. Actually,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5060-1
00:41:30.817 --> 00:41:33.417
you booked the room and Mark's what he's
saying. Like,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5060-2
00:41:33.417 --> 00:41:36.774
wouldn't dollars look penalty's not
paying for the room, but actually.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5112-0
00:41:37.854 --> 00:41:42.145
We'll start modelling good behaviour.
Yeah, but you booked it. Actually,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5112-1
00:41:42.145 --> 00:41:46.495
these are the amount of people that
checked into the room when we have AI

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5112-2
00:41:46.495 --> 00:41:51.374
checked into that room sort of facility.
And they were really 50% under. You know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5112-3
00:41:51.374 --> 00:41:56.135
you can start to get service down gives
you great data that you can start to see

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5112-4
00:41:56.135 --> 00:41:58.134
this insight that retrospectively.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5134-0
00:41:59.084 --> 00:42:01.457
All these issues you're talking about,
you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5134-1
00:42:01.457 --> 00:42:03.734
like we will hopefully if you said to me,
Deb,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5134-2
00:42:03.734 --> 00:42:06.204
actually eating your lunch in here was
not really.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5170-0
00:42:08.654 --> 00:42:12.175
You started the old, you know,
after a while it does sink in that if

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5170-1
00:42:12.175 --> 00:42:13.094
you're correct it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5171-0
00:42:13.214 --> 00:42:14.854
Everybody knows that you're doing that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5163-0
00:42:14.384 --> 00:42:15.264
Yeah, I'm sorry.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5172-0
00:42:14.974 --> 00:42:17.094
And nobody else is doing that, it's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5190-0
00:42:17.454 --> 00:42:17.574
You.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5191-0
00:42:17.574 --> 00:42:20.101
Could start to use that insight to
correct behaviour.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5191-1
00:42:20.101 --> 00:42:23.798
You know checking in the number of people
that actually checked into training,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5191-2
00:42:23.798 --> 00:42:24.734
for example on that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5193-0
00:42:24.464 --> 00:42:29.962
<v Mark Sedge>Another another thing you can do if it
helps is to if for any reason you do</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5193-1
00:42:29.962 --> 00:42:35.388
<v Mark Sedge>consume an external source room or
whatever and you know the cost of that,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5193-2
00:42:35.388 --> 00:42:41.248
<v Mark Sedge>what you can do is you can use that as a
benchmark cost and equivalent size room</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5193-3
00:42:41.248 --> 00:42:42.984
<v Mark Sedge>internally. So by using.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5196-0
00:42:43.064 --> 00:42:47.232
<v Mark Sedge>I think so. If you go, you know,
sometimes it'll be, I don't know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5196-1
00:42:47.232 --> 00:42:50.404
<v Mark Sedge>£100 an hour.
Let's just make it £100 an hour for,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5196-2
00:42:50.404 --> 00:42:53.141
<v Mark Sedge>you know,
an 8 seater room in some sensible</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5196-3
00:42:53.141 --> 00:42:58.055
<v Mark Sedge>location and you've got 8 seater rooms.
What you can do is you can arbitrarily</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5196-4
00:42:58.055 --> 00:42:58.304
<v Mark Sedge>say.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5199-0
00:42:58.744 --> 00:43:03.101
<v Mark Sedge>If you know not fulfilling this room
means that the organisation might be</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5199-1
00:43:03.101 --> 00:43:07.281
<v Mark Sedge>spending someone else in the organisation
might be spending, you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5199-2
00:43:07.281 --> 00:43:10.460
<v Mark Sedge>so you can you can,
although you you can't, you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5199-3
00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.933
<v Mark Sedge>pull the cost lever.
You can do an indicative view because</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5199-4
00:43:13.933 --> 00:43:18.584
<v Mark Sedge>what that also means is it say I was
booking a room and I knew typically what.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5203-0
00:43:18.704 --> 00:43:22.301
<v Mark Sedge>It would cost locally to do that and I
couldn't get a room.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5203-1
00:43:22.301 --> 00:43:26.676
<v Mark Sedge>At least I could budget for it.
And then maybe maybe take action myself.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5203-2
00:43:26.676 --> 00:43:29.493
<v Mark Sedge>Right.
So you've got it enables your customers</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5203-3
00:43:29.493 --> 00:43:34.049
<v Mark Sedge>1:00 to be able to effectively book two
enables you to stop some of the bad</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5203-4
00:43:34.049 --> 00:43:38.544
<v Mark Sedge>behaviour and it makes it a little bit
more transparent about the options.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5204-0
00:43:38.704 --> 00:43:43.046
<v Mark Sedge>They potentially will face if they can't
get the location or the room,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5204-1
00:43:43.046 --> 00:43:45.064
<v Mark Sedge>or the facilities that they want.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5249-0
00:43:46.534 --> 00:43:49.867
I mean, it's a good point.
It's bad if you say, Mark,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5206-0
00:43:46.704 --> 00:43:46.984
<v Mark Sedge>Some.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5249-1
00:43:49.867 --> 00:43:52.891
this room has a value of X which is call
it 100.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5249-2
00:43:52.891 --> 00:43:57.767
The default number and it had one person
and the meeting was called, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5249-3
00:43:57.767 --> 00:44:01.531
had no client name in.
You could as said that the person you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5249-4
00:44:01.531 --> 00:44:02.334
start to add.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5285-0
00:44:03.454 --> 00:44:07.789
The reason for and the booking is your
insight. You know it's very informal,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5285-1
00:44:07.789 --> 00:44:11.900
but you can get this metrics that
actually there was one person in there

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5285-2
00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.898
eating their lunch or there was 20 people
doing training and it costs.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5285-3
00:44:15.898 --> 00:44:18.094
So that could be for each of the rooms.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5289-0
00:44:16.314 --> 00:44:16.594
1.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5294-0
00:44:18.244 --> 00:44:20.684
We can start to give a price, capacity.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5307-0
00:44:22.414 --> 00:44:25.094
And the categories it can be useful,
but at least it's a good.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5330-0
00:44:25.114 --> 00:44:29.900
Short employees, but it's flexible.
It's the bad behaviour,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5330-1
00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:36.202
is frustrating and it's just because of
essentially the services they can get.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5330-2
00:44:36.202 --> 00:44:39.074
So we have the weekly internal team.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5368-0
00:44:41.534 --> 00:44:45.785
They can have an APE laptop,
so this is where it is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5368-1
00:44:45.785 --> 00:44:51.962
We've challenged us over the years.
Recently I suggested for London that all

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5368-2
00:44:51.962 --> 00:44:56.374
internal meetings with kids and go to the
third floor.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5371-0
00:44:57.214 --> 00:44:57.254
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5403-0
00:45:00.054 --> 00:45:04.382
Due to the kitchen media and that was one
of the main priorities,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5403-1
00:45:04.382 --> 00:45:08.317
kitchen on the 3rd floor was easy to
develop food etcetera,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5403-2
00:45:08.317 --> 00:45:11.334
but due to the fianna's on that floor it
was.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5412-0
00:45:13.324 --> 00:45:16.884
Because they don't want anybody outside
the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5418-0
00:45:18.404 --> 00:45:22.244
I think then yeah, because it's yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5427-0
00:45:23.054 --> 00:45:25.814
So that was at all.
It would have the capacity.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5446-0
00:45:27.854 --> 00:45:33.614
For KM and for second floor,
they don't ask for address.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5480-0
00:45:34.074 --> 00:45:37.150
So,
and I think walls for each walls for each

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5480-1
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:42.434
room. So I just said 4th floor can have,
you know it was something to build a.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5466-0
00:45:42.404 --> 00:45:42.804
Matrix.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5481-0
00:45:42.874 --> 00:45:46.262
Here so that this client maybe you don't
just get catering,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5481-1
00:45:46.262 --> 00:45:48.634
the fact that you've booked the 4th floor.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5505-0
00:45:49.414 --> 00:45:52.576
You know that's against the rules of that
particular time of meeting,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5505-1
00:45:52.576 --> 00:45:56.054
so maybe there are, I don't know,
if team meetings are entitled to catering.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5506-0
00:45:56.694 --> 00:45:57.014
The RFP.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5549-0
00:45:59.584 --> 00:46:04.137
OK, so there's some rules there.
So meeting with cost code equals access

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5549-1
00:46:04.137 --> 00:46:09.126
to catering meetings without Costco,
even though you might be on the 4th floor.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5549-2
00:46:09.126 --> 00:46:13.866
No jumping up and down that it might be.
I've always been on the 4th floor.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5549-3
00:46:13.866 --> 00:46:14.864
I always get my.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5554-0
00:46:16.134 --> 00:46:17.974
Catering or order of my.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5562-0
00:46:19.534 --> 00:46:20.414
I think 15 people.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5573-0
00:46:22.614 --> 00:46:25.814
There's like 3 people who have scheduled
their meet at the same time, Steve.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5615-0
00:46:27.534 --> 00:46:30.606
I just ordered like a day.
It would make it so much easier,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5615-1
00:46:30.606 --> 00:46:33.525
but it's closer.
Booking it all at the exact same point.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5615-2
00:46:33.525 --> 00:46:37.519
So then we're having names across the
large meeting rooms which if they could

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5615-3
00:46:37.519 --> 00:46:40.694
choose a age then that would help us,
we could put that back.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5616-0
00:46:41.334 --> 00:46:42.054
I mean, yeah, that's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5617-0
00:46:41.744 --> 00:46:46.734
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, this is. This is the challenges,
your challenges evening out the capacity</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5617-1
00:46:46.734 --> 00:46:51.474
<v Mark Sedge>right in in sort of IT terms demand
versus capacity just as you save if the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5617-2
00:46:51.474 --> 00:46:56.588
<v Mark Sedge>communications if teams sort of learnt to
not all try and have their team meeting</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5617-3
00:46:56.588 --> 00:47:00.704
<v Mark Sedge>on a Monday sucking up all of the meeting
rooms, but you sort of.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5621-0
00:47:00.784 --> 00:47:04.273
<v Mark Sedge>You're able to take the view to stagger
it or whatever,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5621-1
00:47:04.273 --> 00:47:07.076
<v Mark Sedge>and some of those messaging again it's
it's,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5621-2
00:47:07.076 --> 00:47:11.935
<v Mark Sedge>you know through through the behavioural
pattern of the booking you'd like to</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5621-3
00:47:11.935 --> 00:47:16.544
<v Mark Sedge>think that they'd get to that position
where they'd start to even it out.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5674-0
00:47:17.374 --> 00:47:19.853
Airlines used to,
I mean like remember airlines,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5674-1
00:47:19.853 --> 00:47:23.799
were these overbooked by 10% if they're
seats and then they would almost give

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5641-0
00:47:21.674 --> 00:47:22.034
Thank you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5674-2
00:47:23.799 --> 00:47:26.177
somebody a reward if you move. Yeah.
You know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5674-3
00:47:26.177 --> 00:47:29.566
you could have two extra flights if you
know there's an incentive.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5674-4
00:47:29.566 --> 00:47:32.703
Not suggesting this,
but you could be that actually why don't

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5674-5
00:47:32.703 --> 00:47:35.334
you we've got this capacity if we need
some adjust.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5707-0
00:47:36.174 --> 00:47:40.344
Ment is it possible?
I know that possibly bundled up two days

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5707-1
00:47:40.344 --> 00:47:43.774
back in a week mandatory.
Is that right and these?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5697-0
00:47:44.134 --> 00:47:45.094
Then you bought your 3.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5708-0
00:47:45.294 --> 00:47:49.974
That everyone, if they could say,
actually we're going to do, you know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5712-0
00:47:51.854 --> 00:47:52.694
A good Wednesday.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5758-0
00:47:53.924 --> 00:47:57.551
Tuesday, Wednesday. Well, you know,
come into, we're going to adjust it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5758-1
00:47:57.551 --> 00:48:01.477
There was room for because it's not
regulatory or compliance, is it? They can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5758-2
00:48:01.477 --> 00:48:05.054
They're not bound by a day, you know,
certain things may be in finance.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5758-3
00:48:05.054 --> 00:48:08.384
You're bound on a particular day.
You have to do it because you're

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5758-4
00:48:08.384 --> 00:48:10.967
regulated.
But internal team meetings there is that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5758-5
00:48:10.967 --> 00:48:11.564
flexibility.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5767-0
00:48:12.374 --> 00:48:13.614
As a change that suggested.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5813-0
00:48:13.854 --> 00:48:14.534
Yes, as I can't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5814-0
00:48:14.534 --> 00:48:15.654
Hear him training but like they.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5815-0
00:48:15.654 --> 00:48:18.136
Could like,
but even if it's like once at 9 ones at

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5815-1
00:48:18.136 --> 00:48:18.614
lunch and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5816-0
00:48:18.614 --> 00:48:19.054
One's good.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5783-0
00:48:19.074 --> 00:48:19.274
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5817-0
00:48:19.174 --> 00:48:22.591
Afternoon.
You can only use 422 at all with the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5817-1
00:48:22.591 --> 00:48:26.578
exact same point,
especially in months as with clients,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5817-2
00:48:26.578 --> 00:48:26.934
yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5818-0
00:48:27.054 --> 00:48:30.215
So you've got an option though.
If you've got. If you still get morning,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5818-1
00:48:30.215 --> 00:48:31.254
mid, morning, afternoon.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5850-0
00:48:32.054 --> 00:48:33.094
This probably you could try the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5851-0
00:48:33.094 --> 00:48:33.414
Day.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5852-0
00:48:33.414 --> 00:48:38.551
In three and you've got three days.
There's nine options for them to say,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5852-1
00:48:38.551 --> 00:48:39.454
you know can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5853-0
00:48:39.734 --> 00:48:40.014
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5854-0
00:48:40.214 --> 00:48:44.012
Is there a possibility and which one if
you would like to model good behaviour

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5854-1
00:48:44.012 --> 00:48:44.734
first you know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5860-0
00:48:45.454 --> 00:48:46.614
Pulled out for, you know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5867-0
00:48:49.374 --> 00:48:50.414
Obviously it sounds.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5870-0
00:48:51.624 --> 00:48:52.944
They'll do it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5888-0
00:48:53.894 --> 00:48:59.934
If it just keep then you could have like
you just change their days.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5914-0
00:48:59.924 --> 00:49:04.741
Yeah. Which I'll bunch breakfast or lunch,
and obviously the facilities as well

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5914-1
00:49:04.741 --> 00:49:05.404
because on.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5915-0
00:49:05.404 --> 00:49:06.364
The 4th floor.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5916-0
00:49:07.084 --> 00:49:12.709
They don't have to use them on laptop,
so for the Council that Council training

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5916-1
00:49:12.709 --> 00:49:16.084
previously would have to take their own
laptop.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5922-0
00:49:17.174 --> 00:49:17.774
Presentation.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5937-0
00:49:19.384 --> 00:49:21.224
Oh, I see. So you can still work and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5938-0
00:49:21.224 --> 00:49:21.824
I'll catch you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5946-0
00:49:21.254 --> 00:49:22.014
So the 4th.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5947-0
00:49:22.014 --> 00:49:26.814
Floor. They can have a room laptop,
so that's one of the again services.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5984-0
00:49:27.464 --> 00:49:27.824
Simply.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5951-0
00:49:28.414 --> 00:49:29.534
Do they? Could they? I mean, that's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5985-0
00:49:29.824 --> 00:49:30.944
Pushing back, do they?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5986-0
00:49:31.224 --> 00:49:32.304
Could they bring the room laptop?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5987-0
00:49:32.304 --> 00:49:32.624
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5988-0
00:49:32.944 --> 00:49:35.169
OK,
so there's an opportunity sort of there

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5988-1
00:49:35.169 --> 00:49:35.624
that you?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5989-0
00:49:35.624 --> 00:49:35.984
Could.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5990-0
00:49:36.864 --> 00:49:41.255
Streamline and could just bring your own
laptop. I mean, that's not for this remit,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5990-1
00:49:41.255 --> 00:49:42.824
but part of that conversation.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/5995-0
00:49:47.774 --> 00:49:48.574
On laptop.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6002-0
00:49:50.694 --> 00:49:51.694
The only thing I'm thinking is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6035-0
00:49:51.854 --> 00:49:55.933
To make the possible less special,
and it's nice. But if we try and make it,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6035-1
00:49:55.933 --> 00:49:59.694
if we reduce a disparity between the
other meeting grades, that might.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6036-0
00:49:59.694 --> 00:50:01.734
Be just EV. Don't want to give them to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6037-0
00:50:01.734 --> 00:50:01.854
The.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6056-0
00:50:03.654 --> 00:50:06.974
Board. So we've added so they won't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6062-0
00:50:04.134 --> 00:50:05.174
Just not a genius.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6063-0
00:50:05.454 --> 00:50:07.134
Yeah, like some nice sunshines.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6064-0
00:50:07.654 --> 00:50:09.895
Yeah,
but we've got some quick wins that you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6064-1
00:50:09.895 --> 00:50:10.094
got.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6105-0
00:50:11.654 --> 00:50:12.574
As you said, training we.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6106-0
00:50:12.574 --> 00:50:12.774
Could.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6107-0
00:50:13.654 --> 00:50:18.346
It's working our system, you know.
Is it possible we're looking at this?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6083-0
00:50:14.774 --> 00:50:15.094
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6107-1
00:50:18.346 --> 00:50:21.816
Use the system. You know,
we're modelling the system.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6107-2
00:50:21.816 --> 00:50:25.994
It's part of the trial.
Can we showcase moving free training our

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6107-3
00:50:25.994 --> 00:50:26.894
meetings over?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6120-0
00:50:27.774 --> 00:50:32.054
The course of three days or three times
in the day it's worth a challenge.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6121-0
00:50:31.174 --> 00:50:31.894
It's actually.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6172-0
00:50:32.744 --> 00:50:34.944
Or is it more occasional like it's normal?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6173-0
00:50:34.944 --> 00:50:37.584
Yeah. I think listening to it, I think.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6174-0
00:50:37.584 --> 00:50:39.344
What we're trying to, Sophie,
is a cultural.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6175-0
00:50:39.344 --> 00:50:40.264
Issue, aren't we?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6176-0
00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:43.982
And technology doesn't fix culture.
Wonderful as it has,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6149-0
00:50:42.774 --> 00:50:43.094
No.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6154-0
00:50:43.174 --> 00:50:43.294
No.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6176-1
00:50:43.982 --> 00:50:47.433
but I think there are.
I think the key thing is for Mark is

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6176-2
00:50:47.433 --> 00:50:51.344
talking about with the dollars approach
where we can actually show.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6213-0
00:50:51.774 --> 00:50:56.236
The cost of the culture,
because that's when you can then build

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6213-1
00:50:56.236 --> 00:51:01.883
some consensus around how do we want to
actually behave and and treat each other

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6206-0
00:50:59.504 --> 00:51:03.024
Yes, you must get more points, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6192-0
00:50:59.624 --> 00:51:00.664
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6213-2
00:51:01.883 --> 00:51:04.254
and then then the system can help.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6217-0
00:51:04.514 --> 00:51:05.394
Yes, you know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6225-0
00:51:06.224 --> 00:51:09.977
Model the behaviour,
but I think fundamentally it's a culture

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6225-1
00:51:09.977 --> 00:51:10.704
problem and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6230-0
00:51:10.944 --> 00:51:16.289
<v Mark Sedge>But what? Sorry I was in support of that.
One of the things we need to do is even</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6228-0
00:51:13.014 --> 00:51:13.534
Yep, no.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6230-1
00:51:16.289 --> 00:51:19.679
<v Mark Sedge>even if you,
even if we can't necessarily shift the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6230-2
00:51:19.679 --> 00:51:23.199
<v Mark Sedge>behaviours,
it's about level of transparency and what</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6230-3
00:51:23.199 --> 00:51:26.980
<v Mark Sedge>it impacts on the organisation, right?
The people effort,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6230-4
00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:30.304
<v Mark Sedge>I I talk a lot about failure demand IE
the things.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6233-0
00:51:30.384 --> 00:51:34.532
<v Mark Sedge>You have to do because someone's done
something or hasn't done something</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6233-1
00:51:34.532 --> 00:51:39.305
<v Mark Sedge>properly or whatever it is, it's you know,
and if organisations really saw the VAT,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6233-2
00:51:39.305 --> 00:51:43.793
<v Mark Sedge>the the sort of cost of that and with the
impact on their overall bottom line,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6233-3
00:51:43.793 --> 00:51:45.384
<v Mark Sedge>you'd see behaviours change.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6236-0
00:51:45.744 --> 00:51:51.165
<v Mark Sedge>But it's so it's so invisible to the
audience, it just happens. Whatever.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6236-1
00:51:51.165 --> 00:51:57.099
<v Mark Sedge>You're just an overhead. And it just,
you know, no one considers that, you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6236-2
00:51:57.099 --> 00:52:02.960
<v Mark Sedge>if in in other less can I put this less
cash rich, maybe organisations or less,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6236-3
00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.304
<v Mark Sedge>you know, wealthy organisations.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6239-0
00:52:05.584 --> 00:52:09.862
<v Mark Sedge>They'd be all over this like a rash
because they can't afford not to be</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6239-1
00:52:09.862 --> 00:52:14.497
<v Mark Sedge>because they can't afford to have people
doing stuff to, you know, nursemaid.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6239-2
00:52:14.497 --> 00:52:18.477
<v Mark Sedge>Those that can't, you know,
book meetings properly and blah, blah,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6239-3
00:52:18.477 --> 00:52:21.270
<v Mark Sedge>blah. Right.
So I think you've got two things,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6239-4
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.864
<v Mark Sedge>I think 1.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6242-0
00:52:22.584 --> 00:52:26.436
<v Mark Sedge>We use the systems to do that.
Transparency cost per seat cost per</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6242-1
00:52:26.436 --> 00:52:31.207
<v Mark Sedge>whatever it is, cost. If you have a loan,
a laptop in included in that package for</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6242-2
00:52:31.207 --> 00:52:33.909
<v Mark Sedge>that room,
things like that to get that value.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6242-3
00:52:33.909 --> 00:52:38.623
<v Mark Sedge>But then I think the second thing is we
have to take it up the leadership line to</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6242-4
00:52:38.623 --> 00:52:41.784
<v Mark Sedge>say we're investing all this effort to
try to control.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6246-0
00:52:42.144 --> 00:52:46.915
<v Mark Sedge>Because people are saying I want that one,
you know that type of mindset, right?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6246-1
00:52:46.915 --> 00:52:51.215
<v Mark Sedge>Do you know what I mean? And.
And that's what you're fighting. Yeah. So.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6246-2
00:52:51.215 --> 00:52:55.103
<v Mark Sedge>So when we look at this,
we should be building a bit of a picture</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6246-3
00:52:55.103 --> 00:53:00.051
<v Mark Sedge>that says Sid and crew right up the stack.
These are some of the bold conversations</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6246-4
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:01.464
<v Mark Sedge>you've got to be having.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6249-0
00:53:01.704 --> 00:53:06.635
<v Mark Sedge>With the folks about and the impacts it
has on the organisation and then if they</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6249-1
00:53:06.635 --> 00:53:11.443
<v Mark Sedge>say yeah, but we're happy to fund it,
then that becomes a different story then</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6249-2
00:53:11.443 --> 00:53:14.852
<v Mark Sedge>it becomes a system management.
How do we make it easy?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6249-3
00:53:14.852 --> 00:53:19.965
<v Mark Sedge>And then if they get if you're producing
your demand volume and you're saying well,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6249-4
00:53:19.965 --> 00:53:21.304
<v Mark Sedge>you know last week we.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6251-0
00:53:21.424 --> 00:53:24.777
<v Mark Sedge>We will operate in 120% because we got
loads of moves etcetera,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6251-1
00:53:24.777 --> 00:53:27.239
<v Mark Sedge>we could do with another player on the
ground.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6251-2
00:53:27.239 --> 00:53:30.906
<v Mark Sedge>They shouldn't argue with that because
you've got the metrics to say,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6251-3
00:53:30.906 --> 00:53:33.997
<v Mark Sedge>this is what you're costing.
And if you want that service,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6251-4
00:53:33.997 --> 00:53:35.464
<v Mark Sedge>then you have to pay for it.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6286-0
00:53:38.394 --> 00:53:41.663
And you're, I mean,
it sounds like it's always in reactive

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6286-1
00:53:41.663 --> 00:53:44.655
mode. It's not.
You can use the system to at least be

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6286-2
00:53:44.655 --> 00:53:47.315
proactive on the starting point here,
you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6286-3
00:53:47.315 --> 00:53:51.194
because on an aeroplane that analogy
again, there is only one a seat.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6326-0
00:53:51.974 --> 00:53:55.519
That's by the door. Quick exits.
You know they can't shuffle everybody

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6326-1
00:53:55.519 --> 00:53:58.166
around when you're on the flight.
You know there is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6326-2
00:53:58.166 --> 00:54:01.561
And they set those rules.
And to Mark's point that if you want that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6326-3
00:54:01.561 --> 00:54:04.857
seat, you pay a bit more.
And if you want it this seat, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6326-4
00:54:04.857 --> 00:54:07.254
bit more leg when you pay a bit more,
you know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6365-0
00:54:08.224 --> 00:54:12.506
There is that culture that they couldn't
believe it when my airline started to do

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6365-1
00:54:12.506 --> 00:54:16.058
that. What I can, you know,
choose my seat. And I have to pay more.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6365-2
00:54:16.058 --> 00:54:19.348
You know that type of thing.
But it's part of our mindset now,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6365-3
00:54:19.348 --> 00:54:22.064
but we certainly categorise those rooms
at the 1st.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6377-0
00:54:22.854 --> 00:54:24.654
Points which might be useful starting
points.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6417-0
00:54:23.614 --> 00:54:25.546
Yes,
I'm thinking I'm thinking that the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6417-1
00:54:25.546 --> 00:54:28.783
approval that's coming into mind,
so if they go into the template,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6390-0
00:54:27.174 --> 00:54:27.534
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6417-2
00:54:28.783 --> 00:54:32.214
is that on the form and it's actually
just an internal room, but they.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6396-0
00:54:30.214 --> 00:54:30.414
Yep.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6418-0
00:54:32.214 --> 00:54:32.694
Want the four?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6419-0
00:54:32.694 --> 00:54:37.694
Foot we go and say. Yeah. Yeah.
So that's probably the first.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6411-0
00:54:35.254 --> 00:54:35.734
Approver.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6421-0
00:54:38.054 --> 00:54:38.254
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6427-0
00:54:40.984 --> 00:54:42.664
Yeah. And I understand that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6446-0
00:54:44.904 --> 00:54:48.891
You you are a law firm and there's
partners and they're generating. Look,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6446-1
00:54:48.891 --> 00:54:52.824
I understand that that's the, you know,
it's not a restaurant and we're.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6468-0
00:54:54.244 --> 00:54:58.690
Of of all catering or booking rooms and
the model is there to see and there's

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6468-1
00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:01.484
bringing the money.
It's an authorised managing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6467-0
00:55:00.244 --> 00:55:00.564
I would.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6490-0
00:55:03.264 --> 00:55:07.387
Their ability to do that 80% billing,
90% billing, making it easy,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6490-1
00:55:07.387 --> 00:55:10.464
they can hit the ground running every
single day.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6512-0
00:55:12.264 --> 00:55:16.955
But there are other walls that we could
put in place that that they could be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6512-1
00:55:16.955 --> 00:55:20.504
They the partner could eat his lunch in a
different space.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6543-0
00:55:20.264 --> 00:55:25.551
You know, I think what,
what the process was requesting it was

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6543-1
00:55:25.551 --> 00:55:29.831
booked by three different parties
different times.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6543-2
00:55:29.831 --> 00:55:33.944
So we would then approach these to these
people.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6546-0
00:55:37.454 --> 00:55:37.934
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6580-0
00:55:40.654 --> 00:55:44.936
We can't be that person. We don't have.
We don't have the team to do it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6580-1
00:55:44.936 --> 00:55:49.393
I think we need to pass the ball,
so if they can come in and say let's look

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6580-2
00:55:49.393 --> 00:55:53.734
at this room and such and such as booked,
we would see and unfortunately.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6581-0
00:55:53.054 --> 00:55:53.414
That's all.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6587-0
00:55:55.154 --> 00:55:56.114
Yeah. Call yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6590-0
00:55:55.944 --> 00:55:57.384
So that's the way we're working.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6596-0
00:55:58.424 --> 00:56:00.544
Because you've got my favourite child,
sanchos.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6620-0
00:56:02.144 --> 00:56:05.753
Operations committed to me and partners
because see,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6620-1
00:56:05.753 --> 00:56:09.567
we need that from even though they've
done the process,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6620-2
00:56:09.567 --> 00:56:12.904
they've escalated that and it's contacted
to me.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6628-0
00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:15.984
Again, it's will never, probably.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6631-0
00:56:15.624 --> 00:56:18.435
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, but you shouldn't be.
If they're negotiating.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6631-1
00:56:18.435 --> 00:56:22.002
<v Mark Sedge>If they want to basically chivvy somebody
out room, they have to,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6631-2
00:56:22.002 --> 00:56:26.326
<v Mark Sedge>they have to have the conversation and
they the only way that you do the change</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6631-3
00:56:26.326 --> 00:56:30.379
<v Mark Sedge>is they've got evidence of an e-mail
agreement or whatever it is that that</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6631-4
00:56:30.379 --> 00:56:33.784
<v Mark Sedge>person says I move.
So you almost need to go talk to the hand.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6634-0
00:56:34.344 --> 00:56:37.311
<v Mark Sedge>You need to be able to sort of, say,
talk to the hand.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6634-1
00:56:37.311 --> 00:56:40.170
<v Mark Sedge>You haven't done the negotiation because
you're not.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6633-0
00:56:38.074 --> 00:56:38.274
Oh.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6634-2
00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:43.730
<v Mark Sedge>It's not your job to go into battle.
Now if they're saying it is,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6634-3
00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:46.427
<v Mark Sedge>then that's again,
that's a different cost model.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6634-4
00:56:46.427 --> 00:56:50.904
<v Mark Sedge>That's a different structural piece that
needs to sit in the organisation because.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6637-0
00:56:51.824 --> 00:56:54.873
<v Mark Sedge>You know it,
it sucks up hours negotiating with</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6637-1
00:56:54.873 --> 00:56:57.794
<v Mark Sedge>certainly seniors. You know,
I've seen it in,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6637-2
00:56:57.794 --> 00:57:02.621
<v Mark Sedge>in other organisations where it becomes
an absolute pain in the proverbials</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6637-3
00:57:02.621 --> 00:57:07.512
<v Mark Sedge>because you just backwards and forwards
backwards and forwards until finally</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6637-4
00:57:07.512 --> 00:57:09.544
<v Mark Sedge>someone escalates and they fold.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6638-0
00:57:09.904 --> 00:57:11.904
<v Mark Sedge>Because that's in essence, what happens,
isn't it?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6678-0
00:57:13.274 --> 00:57:16.897
And it's honestly right up to the last
minutes of that. Actually,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6678-1
00:57:16.897 --> 00:57:21.069
I'm in the room. I'm not moving. Yes,
you know, I'm actually, I'm not even.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6678-2
00:57:21.069 --> 00:57:24.088
I'm not going.
So I can imagine that at that point for

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6678-3
00:57:24.088 --> 00:57:27.985
repetitive, whatever it might be.
But I know we're going slightly off,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6678-4
00:57:27.985 --> 00:57:28.754
but certainly.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6718-0
00:57:29.544 --> 00:57:32.908
I don't know. I mean,
we've talked about owners of processes,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6718-1
00:57:32.908 --> 00:57:35.621
owners of data owners,
but maybe there isn't not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6718-2
00:57:35.621 --> 00:57:40.016
But I'm suggesting that there is owners
of a room as well that they can book it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6718-3
00:57:40.016 --> 00:57:42.784
I mean probably in your report from the
last year.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6758-0
00:57:43.464 --> 00:57:47.038
We could start to say actually this
person has always, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6758-1
00:57:47.038 --> 00:57:50.941
you can start to get a structure and
these I know that these bonds are

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6758-2
00:57:50.941 --> 00:57:54.790
probably particularly noisy.
They take up a lot of your time for that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6758-3
00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:58.144
reactive mode rather than it's just a
room. Can you not sit?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6759-0
00:57:58.144 --> 00:57:58.544
In the room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6792-0
00:57:59.504 --> 00:58:02.852
But I understand that they're they
probably like to set the seat.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6792-1
00:58:02.852 --> 00:58:06.911
They know that they want to set. See,
maybe for a client or a meeting and stand

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6792-2
00:58:06.911 --> 00:58:09.498
their ethos. You know, it has to be right.
I mean,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6792-3
00:58:09.498 --> 00:58:11.984
particularly like this room that sets the
scene.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6796-0
00:58:13.534 --> 00:58:13.774
Sorry.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6820-0
00:58:14.344 --> 00:58:14.584
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6821-0
00:58:15.064 --> 00:58:16.384
If there is a stand off is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6822-0
00:58:16.384 --> 00:58:16.624
It.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6823-0
00:58:17.624 --> 00:58:22.624
Do you then have to become the arbitrator?
Do you escalate it or do you?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6824-0
00:58:22.664 --> 00:58:23.424
Say you need to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6828-0
00:58:22.754 --> 00:58:26.114
So I see a team should be sleeping.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6859-0
00:58:26.734 --> 00:58:32.481
See who was booked at and leave it at.
We would see come back to us when it's

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6859-1
00:58:32.481 --> 00:58:37.786
been moved, approved, etcetera.
Then we can rebook it and then look all

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6859-2
00:58:37.786 --> 00:58:39.334
and argue themselves.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6882-0
00:58:39.914 --> 00:58:46.637
Depending on the outcome and the case,
So what happens is most of the females

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6882-1
00:58:46.637 --> 00:58:51.034
head of operations are coming and then I
will say.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6908-0
00:58:52.704 --> 00:58:58.064
And then if I can't do that,
I pass back and say it needs to go above.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6909-0
00:58:58.984 --> 00:58:59.544
But don't get.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6910-0
00:58:59.544 --> 00:59:01.904
Me wrong.
It's it's not like that all the time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6913-0
00:59:02.304 --> 00:59:04.544
Yeah, I mean, this is what we're seeing,
but these are the ones.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6961-0
00:59:05.974 --> 00:59:06.494
Once a month.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6962-0
00:59:07.294 --> 00:59:09.094
Siobhan yeah, probably.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6963-0
00:59:09.094 --> 00:59:09.854
At least once.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6928-0
00:59:09.894 --> 00:59:10.454
OK. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6964-0
00:59:09.934 --> 00:59:12.941
A week. But they take up what I'm saying.
They're noisy,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6936-0
00:59:12.784 --> 00:59:13.264
Oh yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6964-1
00:59:12.941 --> 00:59:16.054
they're very reactive and noisy,
and probably, as you say,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6964-2
00:59:16.054 --> 00:59:20.274
goes from 1:00 to 1:00, Simon. And again,
this is where the system will come in

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6964-3
00:59:20.274 --> 00:59:22.174
that we can start to set some rules.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6985-0
00:59:23.134 --> 00:59:26.594
And reduce that noise.
There'll always be that partner.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6985-1
00:59:26.594 --> 00:59:30.734
That's what paper scissors.
Is anybody out on the situation? They.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/6998-0
00:59:32.694 --> 00:59:35.134
Actually acknowledge that behaviour is
failed with the PNS.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7015-0
00:59:37.834 --> 00:59:46.764
Do they actually realise like they're
really doing it? That makes sense,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7015-1
00:59:46.764 --> 00:59:48.354
I think it's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7018-0
00:59:49.624 --> 00:59:50.144
Select.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7020-0
00:59:50.864 --> 00:59:51.024
Like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7030-0
00:59:53.534 --> 00:59:55.374
I hope he wants to be the PE that goes
back.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7040-0
00:59:55.544 --> 00:59:58.774
Yeah,
it's visa and she goes to kind of someone,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7056-0
00:59:57.094 --> 01:00:01.612
Yeah. And if he's be trying to,
but here we know exactly how we feel it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7040-1
00:59:58.774 --> 00:59:59.104
yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7056-1
01:00:01.612 --> 01:00:02.974
They know it's coming.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7057-0
01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:05.134
We do it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7071-0
01:00:06.504 --> 01:00:07.184
Yeah, of course.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7072-0
01:00:07.184 --> 01:00:11.309
Essentially, we can move this,
but you need to approach some,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7072-1
01:00:11.309 --> 01:00:13.904
but that that is a worst case scenario.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7121-0
01:00:15.434 --> 01:00:18.855
At least, for instance,
it's like a client wanted for an internal

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7121-1
01:00:18.855 --> 01:00:21.395
like training machine.
Basically it's hierarchy.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7121-2
01:00:21.395 --> 01:00:25.023
You need to move. Basically,
these clients want more than you come in

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7104-0
01:00:23.034 --> 01:00:23.794
Yeah, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7121-3
01:00:25.023 --> 01:00:27.771
at that point,
but if it's client versus client then

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7121-4
01:00:27.771 --> 01:00:29.274
something like tell us, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7122-0
01:00:29.354 --> 01:00:30.314
Yeah, that's difficult.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7126-0
01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:31.414
I'm sorry.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7158-0
01:00:31.764 --> 01:00:34.406
I was sorry I took the reason I asked
because I was wondering whether we need

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7158-1
01:00:34.406 --> 01:00:35.084
to define some sort.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7159-0
01:00:35.084 --> 01:00:35.164
Of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7160-0
01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:39.123
Escalation process if you guys need to
trigger that and sell us competing

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7160-1
01:00:39.123 --> 01:00:41.798
request,
here is the process because there may be

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7160-2
01:00:41.798 --> 01:00:43.564
a legitimate reason like you say.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7173-0
01:00:45.584 --> 01:00:49.209
Or whether that is something that you
just don't duck to your hands with and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7173-1
01:00:49.209 --> 01:00:50.104
you say listen, we.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7219-0
01:00:52.484 --> 01:00:56.338
We're not gonna hold this. I was like,
there may be situations when you do

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7219-1
01:00:56.338 --> 01:01:00.500
actually to trigger an escalation and at
that point probably protects you to say

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7219-2
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.326
this is the escalation procedure.
This is who goes to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7219-3
01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:06.564
And that's the decision maker.
And we take the output of that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7220-0
01:01:06.564 --> 01:01:07.964
Decision and it's the force for.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7221-0
01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:09.564
The only time you have.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7227-0
01:01:11.304 --> 01:01:12.224
And what's the?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7230-0
01:01:13.634 --> 01:01:15.074
No. Why is it just? It's just.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7237-0
01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:19.854
Yeah, I can't see. Yeah. Yeah.
So you've got.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7240-0
01:01:19.744 --> 01:01:23.274
<v Mark Sedge>Interestingly, sorry, Deb,
just kind of pick up on that escalation.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7240-1
01:01:23.274 --> 01:01:26.595
<v Mark Sedge>Interestingly enough, again,
I'm still going back to my sort of</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7240-2
01:01:26.595 --> 01:01:29.243
<v Mark Sedge>history.
It's a it's a slightly different context,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7240-3
01:01:29.243 --> 01:01:33.499
<v Mark Sedge>but it's it was a pharmaceutical company
and they were lab stations and they were</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7240-4
01:01:33.499 --> 01:01:36.042
<v Mark Sedge>good lab stations and not and this
organisation,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7240-5
01:01:36.042 --> 01:01:39.104
<v Mark Sedge>the teams who managed the lab stations
used to have an an.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7244-0
01:01:39.264 --> 01:01:42.553
<v Mark Sedge>Escalation record.
So what they would do is they would open</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7244-1
01:01:42.553 --> 01:01:45.952
<v Mark Sedge>a record that they'd had to escalate,
that had to start time,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7244-2
01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:50.502
<v Mark Sedge>and then it goes through all the process
and they'd catch all the people that were</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7244-3
01:01:50.502 --> 01:01:54.559
<v Mark Sedge>involved in the screaming match, right.
And then they closed that record,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7244-4
01:01:54.559 --> 01:01:58.944
<v Mark Sedge>but then they would cost it based upon
organisational structural cost. So what?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7245-0
01:01:59.024 --> 01:02:04.409
<v Mark Sedge>They started to do is able to think and
they had a they had a cost for lost</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7245-1
01:02:04.409 --> 01:02:07.880
<v Mark Sedge>science,
so they would cost the downtime for the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7245-2
01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:13.619
<v Mark Sedge>person not being able to get to lab to do
the bit that they needed to do and the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7245-3
01:02:13.619 --> 01:02:15.744
<v Mark Sedge>cost of the leadership's time.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7248-0
01:02:16.624 --> 01:02:20.810
<v Mark Sedge>To do an escalation and when they started
to expose the level escalation,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7248-1
01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:24.940
<v Mark Sedge>the behaviour started to shift because
they had the start of the record,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7248-2
01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:28.674
<v Mark Sedge>they had an escalation record.
They could track opening of it and</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7248-3
01:02:28.674 --> 01:02:32.068
<v Mark Sedge>conclusion of it,
and therefore they had an hour, you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7248-4
01:02:32.068 --> 01:02:32.464
<v Mark Sedge>a time.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7251-0
01:02:32.824 --> 01:02:38.171
<v Mark Sedge>Lag and also it helped the team who
managed the lab stations manage their</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7251-1
01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:43.880
<v Mark Sedge>demand because they could show how much
time they were spending on some of the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7251-2
01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:49.660
<v Mark Sedge>petty exchanges because people you know
were being I like the one by the window</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7251-3
01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:50.744
<v Mark Sedge>type behaviour.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7252-0
01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:51.944
<v Mark Sedge>I'll kid you now.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7283-0
01:02:54.544 --> 01:02:59.299
But I think there's an opportunity like
training could be presumably legit.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7283-1
01:02:59.299 --> 01:03:03.741
That's a regular schedule event.
So we've got an opportunity to manage

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7283-2
01:03:03.741 --> 01:03:06.744
that.
Actually if they're in a particular room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7327-0
01:03:07.734 --> 01:03:12.333
They don't get trumped by a client
meeting that might be a an opportunity.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7327-1
01:03:12.333 --> 01:03:16.994
You can select A room that actually in
its room type is always for training

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7327-2
01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:20.673
that's been parked.
So that might help not having to remove

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7327-3
01:03:20.673 --> 01:03:23.494
them.
And there's probably similar rooms for.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7380-0
01:03:24.184 --> 01:03:27.401
You know, you know,
and there's a wide issue is it do you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7380-1
01:03:27.401 --> 01:03:30.784
think you're coming into do you think you
need a room these?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7381-0
01:03:30.784 --> 01:03:30.904
Are.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7382-0
01:03:30.904 --> 01:03:35.090
The type it's that once room types of
rather than, it's just a free for.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7382-1
01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:38.759
You can have anything you like.
Actually these have been set as

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7382-2
01:03:38.759 --> 01:03:41.626
categories.
That's probably a mindset that we can

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7382-3
01:03:41.626 --> 01:03:42.544
start embedding.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7423-0
01:03:43.374 --> 01:03:46.300
And when they start to book a room,
if it's for, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7423-1
01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:49.573
set your what's it for?
And these are the only rooms available to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7423-2
01:03:49.573 --> 01:03:53.094
you. I mean, the system, as you say,
could be the first gatekeeper of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7424-0
01:03:53.094 --> 01:03:57.774
That see if obviously I'm all serious now
can say permission, so obviously.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7456-0
01:03:58.664 --> 01:04:03.258
The 300. Yeah. Great.
We try not to put external clients in

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7429-0
01:04:00.164 --> 01:04:00.484
Yep.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7456-1
01:04:03.258 --> 01:04:07.853
them. Yeah, Even so again,
there is no set in place because

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7442-0
01:04:04.944 --> 01:04:05.024
FM.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7456-2
01:04:07.853 --> 01:04:12.984
essentially I've removed that from the
team. So obviously, Ashley.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7491-0
01:04:14.174 --> 01:04:16.014
That was there. We had.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7492-0
01:04:16.414 --> 01:04:17.494
To get the approval, we.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7493-0
01:04:17.494 --> 01:04:21.281
Took it then back,
but we had to copy some sort of agreement.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7493-1
01:04:21.281 --> 01:04:26.291
So can we put in place where they can't
put any further advance in four weeks for

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7493-2
01:04:26.291 --> 01:04:27.574
training week, right?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7525-0
01:04:26.824 --> 01:04:31.736
Of course, getting up. You could do that.
Yeah, those rules that they can't just,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7525-1
01:04:31.736 --> 01:04:35.989
you know, I've got this for a year,
you know, and that's it. You know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7525-2
01:04:35.989 --> 01:04:38.984
I might not ever use it so that the
system. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7520-0
01:04:36.084 --> 01:04:37.044
Yeah, we took the same.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7560-0
01:04:38.694 --> 01:04:42.075
Call, but more than sorry,
say for partners if they want a

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7560-1
01:04:42.075 --> 01:04:46.086
particular group, say the PE,
you kind of know when you're coming in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7560-2
01:04:46.086 --> 01:04:50.555
So I think it's for certain rooms that
can only book like the day in advance.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7560-3
01:04:50.555 --> 01:04:53.134
If they want a meeting room with our
client.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7571-0
01:04:54.134 --> 01:04:57.459
And then if they want on client floor,
I think it's no more than a week in

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7571-1
01:04:57.459 --> 01:04:57.814
advance.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7595-0
01:04:59.564 --> 01:05:03.498
But it actually helped because they knew
when they were.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7595-1
01:05:03.498 --> 01:05:06.879
See that and it stopped the top Trump
behaviour.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7595-2
01:05:06.879 --> 01:05:09.364
But it's probably more painful to P.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7630-0
01:05:09.564 --> 01:05:12.595
It's basically a PE,
are probably the group that we might want

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7630-1
01:05:12.595 --> 01:05:16.397
to speak to in terms of what the customer,
make sure whatever we're proposing,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7630-2
01:05:16.397 --> 01:05:19.044
whether it's the rules and stuff is
actually feasible.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7631-0
01:05:19.044 --> 01:05:22.584
Because you know, something like,
is that planning advance that I know that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7631-1
01:05:22.584 --> 01:05:22.724
we.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7632-0
01:05:22.724 --> 01:05:24.204
All do. We're busy. Wake up.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7642-0
01:05:25.184 --> 01:05:27.744
In in the morning,
what does my calendar look like? OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7679-0
01:05:29.664 --> 01:05:32.397
What is that?
If you that sort of Friday night admin

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7679-1
01:05:32.397 --> 01:05:36.575
looking at your task then I can sort of
see the week ahead of you know it's that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7679-2
01:05:36.575 --> 01:05:40.547
mindset the week ahead of me and then
booking the rooms you know rather than

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7679-3
01:05:40.547 --> 01:05:41.424
this last minute.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7724-0
01:05:42.474 --> 01:05:46.826
And they don't forget that they've
actually called their own Facebook. Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7724-1
01:05:46.826 --> 01:05:47.514
And so then.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7725-0
01:05:47.834 --> 01:05:48.834
We'll send them like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7696-0
01:05:48.374 --> 01:05:49.174
Yes, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7726-0
01:05:48.834 --> 01:05:51.595
The check and then,
but I'll just cancel it so it's not even

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7726-1
01:05:51.595 --> 01:05:53.994
needed. It's just, yeah,
they're booking it just to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7727-0
01:05:53.994 --> 01:05:57.514
Have it so we can put all that in place.
You know, you said maybe for.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7730-0
01:05:56.234 --> 01:05:57.354
Yes, we still have.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7735-0
01:05:58.374 --> 01:06:01.414
Non clients also non clients non training.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7761-0
01:06:03.574 --> 01:06:07.326
External you know those.
So there's probably a subset of those

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7761-1
01:06:07.326 --> 01:06:10.840
internal meetings.
I would like it because that they can't

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7761-2
01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:14.414
block book or it can only be 55 working
days in advance or.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7762-0
01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:14.824
<v Mark Sedge>So.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7766-0
01:06:15.524 --> 01:06:15.884
Special.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7775-0
01:06:16.194 --> 01:06:19.532
Before it's,
I know that I did it for this because

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7771-0
01:06:17.664 --> 01:06:18.024
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7775-1
01:06:19.532 --> 01:06:20.514
it's a project.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7776-0
01:06:21.184 --> 01:06:24.916
<v Mark Sedge>And what you can do,
what you can do is you can have unique</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7776-1
01:06:24.916 --> 01:06:28.149
<v Mark Sedge>permissions for say,
your team who could book some.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7776-2
01:06:28.149 --> 01:06:32.130
<v Mark Sedge>So if I say I'm scheduling,
I've got a client coming over who's</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7776-3
01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:36.918
<v Mark Sedge>flying over from somewhere. You know,
I need to arrange that and it might be</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7776-4
01:06:36.918 --> 01:06:38.224
<v Mark Sedge>3-4 weeks in advance.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7779-0
01:06:38.544 --> 01:06:41.877
<v Mark Sedge>There's a mechanism where they can
request a future book,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7779-1
01:06:41.877 --> 01:06:46.646
<v Mark Sedge>which means that your team or controlled
group only has the ability to book beyond</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7779-2
01:06:46.646 --> 01:06:51.070
<v Mark Sedge>and outside that window and again,
ServiceNow can structure a whole stack of</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7779-3
01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:54.402
<v Mark Sedge>those you know,
through user group controls as to who has</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7779-4
01:06:54.402 --> 01:06:58.424
<v Mark Sedge>permissions to do certain things,
but you can again, it's just about.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7782-0
01:06:58.504 --> 01:07:03.360
<v Mark Sedge>Trying to regain some of that control.
So where something is scheduled, as I say,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7782-1
01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:07.150
<v Mark Sedge>there will be times almost certain where
there'll be, you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7782-2
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:11.887
<v Mark Sedge>something booked ahead that's critical
that they need a mechanism to be able to</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7782-3
01:07:11.887 --> 01:07:15.736
<v Mark Sedge>say, can I secure that?
Because I've got party of 16 coming over</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7782-4
01:07:15.736 --> 01:07:18.104
<v Mark Sedge>for this session. They're flying all in.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7785-0
01:07:18.304 --> 01:07:21.352
<v Mark Sedge>Blah blah blah.
You're not dissimilar for what we do with</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7785-1
01:07:21.352 --> 01:07:23.875
<v Mark Sedge>our workshops. For example,
with those flights.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7785-2
01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:26.923
<v Mark Sedge>And those things were planned number of
weeks in advance.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7785-3
01:07:26.923 --> 01:07:29.603
<v Mark Sedge>You guys have the ability through a
control group,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7785-4
01:07:29.603 --> 01:07:32.599
<v Mark Sedge>certain people can book that outside and
over and above.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7785-5
01:07:32.599 --> 01:07:35.384
<v Mark Sedge>But you have a mechanism when they're
requesting it.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7787-0
01:07:35.864 --> 01:07:39.884
<v Mark Sedge>To actually raise that as a request to
say, please can you book me something?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7787-1
01:07:39.884 --> 01:07:42.409
<v Mark Sedge>But again,
it puts you on the front foot because</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7787-2
01:07:42.409 --> 01:07:44.264
<v Mark Sedge>you're in, it's a proactive control.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7818-0
01:07:46.114 --> 01:07:46.834
I think you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7788-0
01:07:46.264 --> 01:07:46.904
<v Mark Sedge>Make sense?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7819-0
01:07:47.474 --> 01:07:48.394
Yeah, definitely.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7820-0
01:07:48.514 --> 01:07:51.383
I think the escalation,
when I think there's a lot of people that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7820-1
01:07:51.383 --> 01:07:54.991
can't shout and then you guys are be in
the middle when you're picking the middle,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7820-2
01:07:54.991 --> 01:07:57.034
who do you shout and say actually I need
help.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7825-0
01:07:56.904 --> 01:07:58.864
OK, so I would.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7826-0
01:07:59.094 --> 01:07:59.854
Probably.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7837-0
01:08:01.614 --> 01:08:05.254
Fix the problem just because I probably
had a good relationship.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7831-0
01:08:01.964 --> 01:08:02.204
Thanks.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7862-0
01:08:07.954 --> 01:08:12.157
And they know what's gonna happen if it's
higher up,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7862-1
01:08:12.157 --> 01:08:17.074
they know eventually it's gonna lead to,
you know, moving or.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7854-0
01:08:13.004 --> 01:08:13.564
Maybe.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7863-0
01:08:17.214 --> 01:08:18.654
This is nothing you're going to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7903-0
01:08:19.864 --> 01:08:22.815
Just thinking,
in the future we we are trying to make

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7903-1
01:08:22.815 --> 01:08:27.242
the Nirvana here and what we're Nirvana
be for your explanation or we'll try and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7903-2
01:08:27.242 --> 01:08:30.904
stop things obviously coming down the
track but down the straight.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7905-0
01:08:30.024 --> 01:08:31.424
Yeah, we first come first serve.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7906-0
01:08:31.504 --> 01:08:31.904
Isn't it?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7904-0
01:08:31.944 --> 01:08:33.184
I suppose, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7907-0
01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:33.784
That would be all.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7912-0
01:08:35.384 --> 01:08:36.784
Requests just an update.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7915-0
01:08:38.974 --> 01:08:40.534
2827.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7923-0
01:08:46.304 --> 01:08:48.584
Special.
Was it like the Olympics or something?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7926-0
01:08:50.584 --> 01:08:50.824
No, no.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7931-0
01:08:53.584 --> 01:08:54.504
It's a.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7937-0
01:08:57.384 --> 01:08:57.664
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7964-0
01:09:00.784 --> 01:09:05.347
Definitely.
I've really really like the idea of the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7964-1
01:09:05.347 --> 01:09:11.929
rooms in place. Yes, escalations again,
we could probably talk about that,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7964-2
01:09:11.929 --> 01:09:15.264
but I guess it's not all the time, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7977-0
01:09:15.704 --> 01:09:16.824
I said it's once or twice a week.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7995-0
01:09:16.264 --> 01:09:16.824
You said it's one.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7996-0
01:09:16.824 --> 01:09:18.944
Sort of question.
I'm probably not to the point of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7997-0
01:09:18.944 --> 01:09:20.264
Escalates eventually through to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/7998-0
01:09:20.304 --> 01:09:22.664
Me. Oh, swaps are all the like basic ones.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8004-0
01:09:24.984 --> 01:09:26.584
Deal with that. They shouldn't.
They're gonna.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8056-0
01:09:26.014 --> 01:09:30.698
But the rules might prevent these. I mean,
you're literally putting these rules in

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8056-1
01:09:30.698 --> 01:09:33.294
place.
There could be notifications back when

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8056-2
01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:37.526
they book the room on that the and to
prevent those escalations, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8056-3
01:09:37.526 --> 01:09:41.759
escalation is at the last resort. So.
But these rules are there so that it

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8043-0
01:09:38.314 --> 01:09:38.714
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8056-4
01:09:41.759 --> 01:09:43.734
actually takes them through lounge.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8072-0
01:09:45.294 --> 01:09:50.787
As well, yeah.
So I would love because we have a lot of

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8072-1
01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:53.534
emails to say, can we check?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8111-0
01:09:54.224 --> 01:09:58.161
1550 weeks. I'm ******* check 50 dates.
Aye. So available.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8081-0
01:09:55.994 --> 01:09:57.154
Sorry 50 days.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8111-1
01:09:58.161 --> 01:10:02.699
And then you want to be provisionally
booked. Half of those states.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8111-2
01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:07.704
So if we had those in place to say no,
you can have three days only. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8112-0
01:10:07.914 --> 01:10:09.354
I'm sad as yes also.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8150-0
01:10:10.134 --> 01:10:12.728
All those, all those rules we can put in,
you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8150-1
01:10:12.728 --> 01:10:16.868
and already those user stories are coming
out today and this is this is what we're

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8150-2
01:10:16.868 --> 01:10:19.611
talking about.
User stories is that the scenarios real

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8150-3
01:10:19.611 --> 01:10:22.854
life scenarios that the system can do the
heavy lifting for you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8204-0
01:10:24.734 --> 01:10:24.974
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8156-0
01:10:24.984 --> 01:10:25.344
So you can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8205-0
01:10:25.374 --> 01:10:28.974
Only do the following.
You can't just blanket room and only use

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8205-1
01:10:28.974 --> 01:10:33.193
because units for this blanket room block
book and it becomes unavailable.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8205-2
01:10:33.193 --> 01:10:37.525
But actually I only wanted it between
10:00 and 11:00 so it prevents it from

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8205-3
01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:41.012
being used by anybody else,
but actually it streamlines that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8205-4
01:10:41.012 --> 01:10:44.894
Actually from those block bookings if
they didn't do it in that way.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8211-0
01:10:45.694 --> 01:10:48.014
50 percent, 70% more capacity.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8248-0
01:10:49.664 --> 01:10:53.724
So all of that can be upfront,
we can set that the matrix behind the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8248-1
01:10:53.724 --> 01:10:57.902
scenes and type through size of the room.
Maybe an owner of that room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8248-2
01:10:57.902 --> 01:11:02.904
If you look at an annual report from last
year who sat where and what actually felt.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8275-0
01:11:05.784 --> 01:11:09.160
And we can start. Yeah,
doing those rules up front and then it

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8275-1
01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:13.179
gets signed and then they can book it
accordingly and then movement can be

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8275-2
01:11:13.179 --> 01:11:15.645
booked.
So you're not even having to have the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8275-3
01:11:15.645 --> 01:11:16.824
query. I mean, that's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8283-0
01:11:17.474 --> 01:11:18.274
Ideally and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8284-0
01:11:19.274 --> 01:11:20.394
Are you suggesting that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8285-0
01:11:20.394 --> 01:11:21.274
People self-serve.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8301-0
01:11:22.944 --> 01:11:25.251
Self-serve and put the ring themselves on
the portal.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8301-1
01:11:25.251 --> 01:11:26.704
Or do you still want them to call?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8308-0
01:11:27.084 --> 01:11:27.964
That was the composition.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8309-0
01:11:27.964 --> 01:11:30.484
What intention? Yes, that's yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8306-0
01:11:29.144 --> 01:11:29.624
So, right.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8315-0
01:11:31.384 --> 01:11:32.144
Just for me.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8316-0
01:11:32.544 --> 01:11:32.624
To.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8317-0
01:11:32.624 --> 01:11:34.384
Understand from a change perspective.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8318-0
01:11:34.214 --> 01:11:35.134
Yeah. So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8348-0
01:11:37.414 --> 01:11:43.501
The the NTR project was essentially to
remove bookings from our team and they

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8348-1
01:11:43.501 --> 01:11:47.715
would be able to put their own rooms via
room Finder.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8348-2
01:11:47.715 --> 01:11:51.774
So obviously that floor would only need
that floor.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8366-0
01:11:53.054 --> 01:11:57.055
And then it was down to the project
manager to put an escalations to see who

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8366-1
01:11:57.055 --> 01:11:58.614
would be able to accept those.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8380-0
01:11:59.444 --> 01:12:05.011
Generally,
but that is Grant midway through because

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8380-1
01:12:05.011 --> 01:12:06.724
of the possible.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8382-0
01:12:08.734 --> 01:12:09.014
Adverse.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8389-0
01:12:11.334 --> 01:12:15.054
Ity was the NTR rooms, so they had to put.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8401-0
01:12:17.654 --> 01:12:21.916
Back into the teams procession,
but with integration,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8394-0
01:12:18.384 --> 01:12:18.784
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8401-1
01:12:21.916 --> 01:12:23.574
there would be again.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8417-0
01:12:25.334 --> 01:12:30.717
They've got to locate them permissions,
so we basically just book at room and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8417-1
01:12:30.717 --> 01:12:32.374
that's it and tell them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8460-0
01:12:33.514 --> 01:12:36.469
So at the moment,
so if we take all the queries coming to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8460-1
01:12:36.469 --> 01:12:39.729
you, I want this date,
this number of people for this time. OK,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8460-2
01:12:39.729 --> 01:12:43.194
you know and because you know it's on the
4th floor. So that's how.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8461-0
01:12:43.194 --> 01:12:43.434
All.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8462-0
01:12:43.434 --> 01:12:48.040
Your currently the room booking comes.
You have to do all the room bookings for

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8462-1
01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:48.674
every room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8503-0
01:12:49.494 --> 01:12:54.191
There's no self-serve of anybody,
even though it's in their calendar.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8503-1
01:12:54.191 --> 01:12:58.620
They then type. Actually,
we're in the public semi invites route,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8503-2
01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:02.512
room number TBC and then once you've
approved the update,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8503-3
01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:05.934
they update the invite based on the room,
yes. OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8538-0
01:13:06.854 --> 01:13:10.397
Maybe we should,
but in the process we've got lots of at

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8538-1
01:13:10.397 --> 01:13:14.313
the moment you've got.
I saw that there was put up to internal

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8538-2
01:13:14.313 --> 01:13:17.359
rooms.
I think there's external processes and if

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8538-3
01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:20.654
you do the internal,
you'll have the times one room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8551-0
01:13:21.774 --> 01:13:25.721
One date, one activity or one client.
Is that how it comes into?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8551-1
01:13:25.721 --> 01:13:26.814
Then you have one.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8554-0
01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:29.214
1.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8572-0
01:13:30.934 --> 01:13:32.254
Meeting or multiple dates in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8573-0
01:13:32.654 --> 01:13:35.634
Same people.
So we've got a booking things,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8573-1
01:13:35.634 --> 01:13:39.494
a SharePoint form,
OK introduced probably two years ago.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8577-0
01:13:39.914 --> 01:13:40.834
OK, perfect.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8592-0
01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:42.969
Again,
because they want to prevent the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8592-1
01:13:42.969 --> 01:13:47.315
information at the start,
so the emails that were sent through was

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8592-2
01:13:47.315 --> 01:13:48.094
2 sentences.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8601-0
01:13:49.414 --> 01:13:52.814
585 people 2:50. Yeah, it's fine. No.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8633-0
01:13:55.334 --> 01:14:04.008
So form together this information because
we change course. OK,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8606-0
01:13:55.654 --> 01:13:55.854
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8633-1
01:14:04.008 --> 01:14:06.854
so I tried to put it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8634-0
01:14:06.854 --> 01:14:08.614
Here every meeting have to have a.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8635-0
01:14:08.614 --> 01:14:10.174
Cost code so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8636-0
01:14:10.134 --> 01:14:10.894
Play Halo.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8644-0
01:14:12.304 --> 01:14:12.744
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8645-0
01:14:12.824 --> 01:14:14.864
I will find the shower before you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8650-0
01:14:16.454 --> 01:14:16.774
Get in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8651-0
01:14:16.784 --> 01:14:17.184
If they got.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8668-0
01:14:19.094 --> 01:14:19.934
If they got.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8669-0
01:14:20.254 --> 01:14:24.054
Trouble. Yeah. And we've got a card.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8667-0
01:14:24.584 --> 01:14:24.904
Sorry.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8671-0
01:14:27.734 --> 01:14:28.174
No.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8682-0
01:14:32.454 --> 01:14:32.654
No.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8680-0
01:14:34.144 --> 01:14:34.864
Oh, OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8684-0
01:14:36.544 --> 01:14:37.264
3rd floor.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8700-0
01:14:39.184 --> 01:14:42.224
Have the exception because they they they
spoke, they raised the issue.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8701-0
01:14:42.224 --> 01:14:42.744
They say but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8702-0
01:14:42.744 --> 01:14:45.504
They can't have the charge codes, yes,
because.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8720-0
01:14:45.744 --> 01:14:49.316
So the room,
the contemplate and again we push to push

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8720-1
01:14:49.316 --> 01:14:52.824
to pushed and it's CLO again we need to
go back into.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8736-0
01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:57.066
Well,
I think the system will just and Mark

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8734-0
01:14:56.364 --> 01:14:56.724
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8736-1
01:14:57.066 --> 01:14:58.544
will say actually if it says.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8748-0
01:14:59.814 --> 01:15:01.534
If you want Katie,
that child code is mandatory.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8759-0
01:15:01.784 --> 01:15:05.944
We can't even actually,
you can't actually get past the form, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8753-0
01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:04.424
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So what on a pic?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8758-0
01:15:05.574 --> 01:15:05.854
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8761-0
01:15:06.304 --> 01:15:08.900
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.
So typically you'd by their selections of</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8761-1
01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:11.442
<v Mark Sedge>what they needed,
what facilities they needed,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8761-2
01:15:11.442 --> 01:15:15.769
<v Mark Sedge>IE you know whether there's a screen,
whether it was a, you know, presentation,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8761-3
01:15:15.769 --> 01:15:19.014
<v Mark Sedge>whatever catering,
as soon as they take catering to submit,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8761-4
01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:20.744
<v Mark Sedge>they have to put a cost code in.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8762-0
01:15:21.384 --> 01:15:21.904
<v Mark Sedge>All right, so we.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8768-0
01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:22.804
They can't BTP.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8778-0
01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:28.264
I could put somewhere,
do not go to them on teams directly, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8785-0
01:15:30.534 --> 01:15:32.574
To direct them and say have you filled
anything?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8786-0
01:15:32.224 --> 01:15:35.984
<v Mark Sedge>No, but even to so,
the point is they can't submit the form</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8786-1
01:15:35.984 --> 01:15:40.810
<v Mark Sedge>and if we know if the cost codes are
standardised in terms of their look and</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8786-2
01:15:40.810 --> 01:15:45.698
<v Mark Sedge>feel, and that letters and numbers,
what we can do is control what they have,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8786-3
01:15:45.698 --> 01:15:49.144
<v Mark Sedge>so they can't just put two BC or 12345
and make it up.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8789-0
01:15:49.424 --> 01:15:53.403
<v Mark Sedge>If it doesn't follow the pattern,
it will get rejected and they can't</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8789-1
01:15:53.403 --> 01:15:56.927
<v Mark Sedge>submit the request.
So you can put the and make it mandatory.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8789-2
01:15:56.927 --> 01:16:01.418
<v Mark Sedge>So if they turn off catering then it
disappears. If they put it back on again,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8789-3
01:16:01.418 --> 01:16:04.544
<v Mark Sedge>they have to put a cost code in to submit
the request.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8802-0
01:16:05.514 --> 01:16:07.678
And if it was very clever the person
requested, I mean,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8802-1
01:16:07.678 --> 01:16:10.074
they might be under the Costco that
you're not using someone.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8809-0
01:16:11.654 --> 01:16:12.934
You know that or use mine.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8844-0
01:16:13.654 --> 01:16:16.351
A few months,
but there's some clever things,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8844-1
01:16:16.351 --> 01:16:18.990
but certainly that SharePoint form you
have.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8844-2
01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:23.565
We could be that would be the upfront
service that's the entry point and they

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8828-0
01:16:22.304 --> 01:16:22.504
<v Mark Sedge>We.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8844-3
01:16:23.565 --> 01:16:27.494
get used to doing that.
This is the information that we need Trio.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8849-0
01:16:25.824 --> 01:16:28.879
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.
One of the thing in one of the things,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8849-1
01:16:28.879 --> 01:16:34.039
<v Mark Sedge>sorry, just as a bit of background,
one of the things we're trying to do as</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8847-0
01:16:28.934 --> 01:16:29.214
And then.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8849-2
01:16:34.039 --> 01:16:39.673
<v Mark Sedge>part of our foundational data is pull a
cost cost code associated to every person.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8849-3
01:16:39.673 --> 01:16:43.203
<v Mark Sedge>So even even if you're just doing a
request for IT,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8849-4
01:16:43.203 --> 01:16:45.104
<v Mark Sedge>it automatically identifies.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8852-0
01:16:45.504 --> 01:16:49.907
<v Mark Sedge>Or cost centre that you're associated
with whether there's any charging or not</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8852-1
01:16:49.907 --> 01:16:52.972
<v Mark Sedge>doesn't matter.
The point is it captures it so and you</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8852-2
01:16:52.972 --> 01:16:55.647
<v Mark Sedge>can have,
I'm sure you have potentially project</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8852-3
01:16:55.647 --> 01:16:58.601
<v Mark Sedge>codes as well.
So you might have an individuals cost</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8852-4
01:16:58.601 --> 01:17:02.000
<v Mark Sedge>code say at the top of the form,
but if they click catering,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8852-5
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.344
<v Mark Sedge>it will ask them again for the cost code
that the catering.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8855-0
01:17:05.424 --> 01:17:11.042
<v Mark Sedge>Will be charged to and it might be their
own or it might be a project one you know.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8855-1
01:17:11.042 --> 01:17:16.459
<v Mark Sedge>But the point is you cature it and and
the controls within the tool set stops it</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8855-2
01:17:16.459 --> 01:17:18.264
<v Mark Sedge>being submitted without it.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8864-0
01:17:19.614 --> 01:17:21.752
And it's almost that language who's
paying.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8864-1
01:17:21.752 --> 01:17:23.454
Exactly who's paying for this room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8878-0
01:17:23.904 --> 01:17:29.904
See the the the template form we have pre
populated all the templates yes so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8880-0
01:17:30.054 --> 01:17:30.974
It's only today.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8884-0
01:17:31.994 --> 01:17:32.354
No.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8917-0
01:17:32.854 --> 01:17:33.614
And and so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8918-0

01:17:35.494 --> 01:17:37.414
A certain amount of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8920-0
01:17:37.414 --> 01:17:40.294
Days. What are we left? See, I booked.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8921-0
01:17:40.814 --> 01:17:41.774
A room for tomorrow.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8922-0
01:17:41.774 --> 01:17:44.894
And I want to take it and what happens,
but you just don't get it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8927-0
01:17:45.084 --> 01:17:47.884
OK, bye.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8939-0
01:17:47.294 --> 01:17:49.134
So you just so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8940-0
01:17:50.654 --> 01:17:53.414
That needs a mindset of on the form that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8956-0
01:17:54.284 --> 01:17:57.616
You know,
knowledge article or that mindset of

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8956-1
01:17:57.616 --> 01:18:00.524
change that you need 48 hours to request.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8961-0
01:18:00.764 --> 01:18:02.564
We just staying on vacations for people.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8967-0
01:18:03.914 --> 01:18:04.114
Like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/8966-0
01:18:04.144 --> 01:18:04.184
Like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9003-0
01:18:06.464 --> 01:18:07.104
Just.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9004-0
01:18:07.104 --> 01:18:10.331
Yeah, but if they're,
if they're booking upfront that more

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9004-1
01:18:10.331 --> 01:18:14.106
information will be on that,
it could be that if you wanted lunch 48

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9004-2
01:18:14.106 --> 01:18:17.224
hours, maybe tea and coffee might be 24.
You know, it's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9005-0
01:18:17.224 --> 01:18:19.024
Like nicely. I think it's all.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9010-0
01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:21.834
Yeah, he said that. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9033-0
01:18:20.904 --> 01:18:24.357
If I was seeing coffee,
but if they actually physically want,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9033-1
01:18:24.357 --> 01:18:25.304
yeah, so we need.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9034-0
01:18:25.344 --> 01:18:26.824
To detail like so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9035-0
01:18:26.824 --> 01:18:29.145
Say for Kate,
then if it was just tea and coffee,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9035-1
01:18:29.145 --> 01:18:30.584
that would be fine. Yeah, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9076-0
01:18:31.304 --> 01:18:33.031
How? How does it work?
Just having the form?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9076-1
01:18:33.031 --> 01:18:35.104
Do you just take a box sitting coffee?
Or is it like?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9077-0
01:18:35.344 --> 01:18:37.769
That's exciting,
just get added automatically for like

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9077-1
01:18:37.769 --> 01:18:40.502
time and refreshments.
But if it's like internally we need to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9077-2
01:18:40.502 --> 01:18:41.384
request it if we're.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9078-0
01:18:41.384 --> 01:18:43.144
Looking for something like that but they
don't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9079-0
01:18:43.144 --> 01:18:43.744
Usually add the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9080-0
01:18:43.744 --> 01:18:45.584
Document. But if we could see that form.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9082-0
01:18:44.824 --> 01:18:48.981
<v Mark Sedge>What? One of the things you can do again,
I've seen this. I'll go go.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9082-1
01:18:48.981 --> 01:18:52.901
<v Mark Sedge>It goes back to not necessarily exactly
the same context of this,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9082-2
01:18:52.901 --> 01:18:57.652
<v Mark Sedge>but the the pharma company who'd needed
things like waist scales and other bits</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9082-3
01:18:57.652 --> 01:19:00.859
<v Mark Sedge>and pieces,
what they would do is because there was a</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9082-4
01:19:00.859 --> 01:19:03.531
<v Mark Sedge>time.
So if you booked something and you say</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9082-5
01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:04.184
<v Mark Sedge>you wanted.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9088-0
01:19:04.864 --> 01:19:09.564
<v Mark Sedge>You booked and it was next day the
catering option will be greyed out, right?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9088-1
01:19:09.564 --> 01:19:14.564
<v Mark Sedge>So then you then you'd switch the day so
and if you gave three days notice then it</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9086-0
01:19:10.404 --> 01:19:12.084
OK. Yeah, that's it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9088-2
01:19:14.564 --> 01:19:19.023
<v Mark Sedge>would appear and at the top of the form
you'd give the guide notes to say</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9088-3
01:19:19.023 --> 01:19:24.144
<v Mark Sedge>catering. You need 48 hours. Refreshments.
You need this sandwiches. This, whatever.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9090-0
01:19:24.464 --> 01:19:28.541
<v Mark Sedge>And then depending on the day,
it would just grey it out so they can't</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9090-1
01:19:28.541 --> 01:19:33.193
<v Mark Sedge>even select it because they haven't given
you enough notice so you can again the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9090-2
01:19:33.193 --> 01:19:37.844
<v Mark Sedge>tool is able to do these things you know
to enable you to manage the audience as</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9090-3
01:19:37.844 --> 01:19:39.624
<v Mark Sedge>they're populating information.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9091-0
01:19:40.864 --> 01:19:43.064
<v Mark Sedge>Does that,
that sort of thing I think might help you.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9142-0
01:19:43.614 --> 01:19:46.863
Yeah, that would be good.
And we're just looking at the SharePoint

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9142-1
01:19:46.863 --> 01:19:49.432
form and we're maybe on display on the
screen later,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9142-2
01:19:49.432 --> 01:19:52.439
but there's lots of information at
lectern TV, you know that,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9142-3
01:19:52.439 --> 01:19:55.251
but that could be part of the asset of
that room as well.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9142-4
01:19:55.251 --> 01:19:57.094
All the equipment that's within there.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9143-0
01:19:57.254 --> 01:19:58.774
Yeah. And I'm wondering, is it worth?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9144-0
01:19:58.774 --> 01:20:01.414
Taking a screenshot that and putting it
in there as connect.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9150-0
01:20:01.694 --> 01:20:05.094
Yeah, that'd be great.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9151-0
01:20:05.864 --> 01:20:09.144
<v Mark Sedge>And those so those are the things that
you, sorry, Deborah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9167-0
01:20:09.464 --> 01:20:10.864
All screenshots might be I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9168-0
01:20:11.064 --> 01:20:11.424
Know it's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9169-0
01:20:11.904 --> 01:20:14.344
About the things she won't see the drop
downs, but don't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9170-0
01:20:15.064 --> 01:20:15.264
Worry.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9171-0
01:20:15.264 --> 01:20:16.544
About that now, isn't it?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9173-0
01:20:16.304 --> 01:20:19.744
<v Mark Sedge>But they'll be pickless what you'd do in
service now is you'd have them.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9175-0
01:20:20.674 --> 01:20:20.914
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9181-0
01:20:21.624 --> 01:20:25.480
<v Mark Sedge>Sorry. No, no, no. You're right.
That's OK. The point is,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9180-0
01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:24.924
I'm sorry. We're just talking about Paul.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9181-1
01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:30.798
<v Mark Sedge>you'd have the facilities of the room.
Not only do you have number of seats and</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9181-2
01:20:30.798 --> 01:20:35.784
<v Mark Sedge>what have you'd have. Do you need,
you know, collaboration tool, you know?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9184-0
01:20:36.344 --> 01:20:41.810
<v Mark Sedge>Screens, TV lectern. All of those things.
You just have lip tick items because that</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9184-1
01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:46.885
<v Mark Sedge>narrows down which room that you're
aligned to and then you can basically use</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9184-2
01:20:46.885 --> 01:20:51.505
<v Mark Sedge>those selectables to enable to drive the
room and then as an audience,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9184-3
01:20:51.505 --> 01:20:55.344
<v Mark Sedge>if I can go well,
how material is it not to have electrum?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9189-0
01:20:55.384 --> 01:20:59.762
<v Mark Sedge>Well, actually I can stand at the front.
I'll be all right as long as I've got a</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9189-1
01:20:59.762 --> 01:21:03.654
<v Mark Sedge>big screen or something and it enables
the audience to pick and select.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9189-2
01:21:03.654 --> 01:21:06.303
<v Mark Sedge>But if you had a layout.
So I've seen somewhere.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9188-0
01:21:04.064 --> 01:21:04.304
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9189-3
01:21:06.303 --> 01:21:09.329
<v Mark Sedge>If there's a layout change often they'd
need, you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9189-4
01:21:09.329 --> 01:21:13.113
<v Mark Sedge>48 hours to be able to change all the
room around. If it's, you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9189-5
01:21:13.113 --> 01:21:14.464
<v Mark Sedge>if you're doing say like.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9192-0
01:21:16.384 --> 01:21:19.657
<v Mark Sedge>Structured training where there's an exam
at the end, for example,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9192-1
01:21:19.657 --> 01:21:22.245
<v Mark Sedge>you might change the layout of the room
accordingly.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9192-2
01:21:22.245 --> 01:21:25.224
<v Mark Sedge>That takes time for someone to be able to
do that. So again,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9192-3
01:21:25.224 --> 01:21:28.497
<v Mark Sedge>you'd have that option greyed out if you
were booking it next day.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9192-4
01:21:28.497 --> 01:21:31.916
<v Mark Sedge>But if you were booking it the day after,
then it would be available.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9192-5
01:21:31.916 --> 01:21:34.504
<v Mark Sedge>So there's a number of things.
If we understand the.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9195-0
01:21:34.544 --> 01:21:39.632
<v Mark Sedge>Rules and what's in the rooms and provide
a pick list for your audience.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9195-1
01:21:39.632 --> 01:21:43.744
<v Mark Sedge>It makes it so much easier for it to be
facilitated, yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9227-0
01:21:43.894 --> 01:21:44.134
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9228-0
01:21:44.214 --> 01:21:46.580
She said.
And that room doesn't have that lectern

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9228-1
01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:48.900
or that,
and you can't go and get it and move it

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9228-2
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:52.024
to make your, you know, those you know,
if you want these things,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9228-3
01:21:52.024 --> 01:21:54.958
you're in that room.
But then we're not going to start moving

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9228-4
01:21:54.958 --> 01:21:55.574
stuff around.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9231-0
01:21:58.014 --> 01:21:58.214
Unless.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9239-0
01:22:00.814 --> 01:22:02.854
Yeah. Great. I'll put that in the same.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9244-0
01:22:04.734 --> 01:22:05.374
Crystal by myself.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9254-0
01:22:05.984 --> 01:22:08.464
And that whole that would be a great
entry points for you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9306-0
01:22:07.914 --> 01:22:08.074
What?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9307-0
01:22:08.594 --> 01:22:09.554
You bother then.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9308-0
01:22:09.994 --> 01:22:12.874
I'll let the system do the heavy lifting
of the choosing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9309-0
01:22:13.994 --> 01:22:15.794
Can I just ask? I could have got.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9310-0
01:22:15.794 --> 01:22:18.755
A short me,
but you mentioned that Caitlyn needs to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9310-1
01:22:18.755 --> 01:22:23.082
be approved. Like if it's Bill. Katie.
So how does that work just now? Say,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9287-0
01:22:21.584 --> 01:22:21.784
Mm-hmm.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9310-2
01:22:23.082 --> 01:22:27.581
fill out the form and they say they need
full payment because it automatically

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9310-3
01:22:27.581 --> 01:22:28.834
send something to the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9314-0
01:22:29.334 --> 01:22:31.454
That's for the MRI.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9334-0
01:22:33.054 --> 01:22:39.491
So it's it's just calendar and you would
add the services as a shared system. Yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9334-1
01:22:39.491 --> 01:22:40.334
perception.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9382-0
01:22:44.964 --> 01:22:51.525
So they would see a new report,
so they would tell you what are serious

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9382-1
01:22:51.525 --> 01:22:53.804
and important, et cetera.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9383-0
01:22:54.084 --> 01:22:55.924
And serious. Now that could do that.
That's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9384-0
01:22:55.924 --> 01:22:59.475
Also, assignments with roots,
so it may get a notification that this

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9384-1
01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:02.099
has been.
So who do they approve it at that point?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9384-2
01:23:02.099 --> 01:23:04.724
Or is it assumed to prove it's basically
an order?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9387-0
01:23:05.364 --> 01:23:05.804
Also.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9389-0
01:23:06.054 --> 01:23:07.134
Which should have been made.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9419-0
01:23:08.704 --> 01:23:12.970
So they would see.
So if it's catering on their catering on

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9419-1
01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:18.802
that fields assignment task that they've
received it, they could add notes to it,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9419-2
01:23:18.802 --> 01:23:20.224
but can be fed back.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9435-0
01:23:22.184 --> 01:23:26.224
Which it widens that conversation,
doesn't it? Dietary peanut allergies.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9452-0
01:23:27.904 --> 01:23:30.342
Etcetera.
But that could be captured up front as

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9452-1
01:23:30.342 --> 01:23:32.780
well.
You know when they're requesting the form,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9452-2
01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:34.024
any dietary requirements?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9467-0
01:23:34.734 --> 01:23:38.915
Of the individuals. Mm-hmm.
Right up front, as you say,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9467-1
01:23:38.915 --> 01:23:42.574
getting as much information upfront as
possible.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9519-0
01:23:44.464 --> 01:23:47.474
So when KG is required,
it comes in and they can be notified at

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9519-1
01:23:47.474 --> 01:23:49.780
the same time.
It doesn't need to be part of the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9519-2
01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:52.461
workflow you've got it is room booking
and they call it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9519-3
01:23:52.461 --> 01:23:56.036
Essentially it doesn't need to be
sequential, it could be at the same time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9519-4
01:23:56.036 --> 01:23:57.824
Yeah. And Keenan aren't on share rail.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9520-0
01:23:57.824 --> 01:23:58.384
At the moment.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9521-0
01:23:58.384 --> 01:24:00.264
But the plan is for them to go on
ServiceNow.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9523-0
01:24:01.344 --> 01:24:01.584
Thanks.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9533-0
01:24:01.564 --> 01:24:03.844
But they could get if they're.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9542-0
01:24:03.184 --> 01:24:03.384
E-mail.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9543-0
01:24:04.144 --> 01:24:05.624
Because I was just thinking if they were
on.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9544-0
01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:08.184
ServiceNow they have like a dashboard of
like kids.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9545-0
01:24:07.534 --> 01:24:07.894
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9549-0
01:24:08.184 --> 01:24:12.841
<v Mark Sedge>But this is, but you're absolutely right,
but this is where it actually becomes a</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9549-1
01:24:12.841 --> 01:24:17.156
<v Mark Sedge>bolder conversation to say, you know,
why wouldn't you be on service now if</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9549-2
01:24:17.156 --> 01:24:21.245
<v Mark Sedge>you've got a controlled route in and it's
going to be efficient for the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9549-3
01:24:21.245 --> 01:24:24.368
<v Mark Sedge>organisation?
Because I've seen some organisation will</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9549-4
01:24:24.368 --> 01:24:27.264
<v Mark Sedge>present menus, you know,
you can even pick if you.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9552-0
01:24:27.424 --> 01:24:32.180
<v Mark Sedge>What are the typical standard menu that
the catering you know, standard standard,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9552-1
01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:34.964
<v Mark Sedge>you know,
sandwich array with biscuits and what</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9552-2
01:24:34.964 --> 01:24:37.748
<v Mark Sedge>have you.
You take those items and it literally</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9552-3
01:24:37.748 --> 01:24:41.866
<v Mark Sedge>goes straight in and they pick it off and
then they action against it.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9552-4
01:24:41.866 --> 01:24:45.694
<v Mark Sedge>Why would you not, you know?
And this is where I think it's that.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9552-5
01:24:45.694 --> 01:24:47.144
<v Mark Sedge>How do you and we I know.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9553-0
01:24:47.304 --> 01:24:51.376
<v Mark Sedge>We talk about enterprise and we've got
our enterprise scope that we're looking</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9553-1
01:24:51.376 --> 01:24:53.851
<v Mark Sedge>at here,
but this is where ServiceNow does push</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9553-2
01:24:53.851 --> 01:24:57.304
<v Mark Sedge>into the broader enterprise, right,
because it's got that ability.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9556-0
01:24:58.014 --> 01:24:58.374
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9590-0
01:24:59.934 --> 01:25:03.235
What happens if people change their mind
last minute about catering?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9590-1
01:25:03.235 --> 01:25:06.392
They ordered 40 bit 30 and coming that
wasted money, wasted food.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9590-2
01:25:06.392 --> 01:25:08.975
How does that go?
Do you just have to keep going back

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9600-0
01:25:08.584 --> 01:25:11.864
So what we do is we're going to send them
a check.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9590-3
01:25:08.975 --> 01:25:09.454
shapering?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9633-0
01:25:12.074 --> 01:25:17.345
So we said send out check I was hired to
the meeting. So it's been pre booked.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9633-1
01:25:17.345 --> 01:25:20.348
Yeah,
they've ordered 100 calories and so we

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9633-2
01:25:20.348 --> 01:25:25.619
send a horrible manual e-mail because we
can't take the absolute to check each

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9626-0
01:25:23.914 --> 01:25:24.274
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9633-3
01:25:25.619 --> 01:25:27.154
book in that case then.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9681-0
01:25:28.414 --> 01:25:32.431
The form and send it to the relevant
people to see. Do you still need that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9681-1
01:25:32.431 --> 01:25:36.395
Do you need to put changes within the 40
hour window? We can make changes,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9681-2
01:25:36.395 --> 01:25:39.355
we can cancel,
so it's that's 40 hour window period and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9681-3
01:25:39.355 --> 01:25:43.214
they can change it anything out or 8
again goes to Caitlin for approval.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9682-0
01:25:43.414 --> 01:25:46.429
Yeah.
And I think that comes into that form up

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9682-1
01:25:46.429 --> 01:25:46.814
front.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9729-0
01:25:47.274 --> 01:25:49.707
As you said, Mark,
to enhance that experience,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9729-1
01:25:49.707 --> 01:25:52.399
I'm getting a room.
You're booking a room and gosh,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9729-2
01:25:52.399 --> 01:25:56.282
there's this extra concierge service
upfront. I can select my, as you say,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9729-3
01:25:56.282 --> 01:26:00.269
canopies or sandwich or coffee or spark.
You know, it starts to feel Cookie.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9729-4
01:26:00.269 --> 01:26:02.754
This is nice. You know,
when you're setting up.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9767-0
01:26:04.574 --> 01:26:08.751
And you become responsible for it.
And then it goes to catering and yourself.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9767-1
01:26:08.751 --> 01:26:11.803
And then 48 hours,
the system can send the notification,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9767-2
01:26:11.803 --> 01:26:16.140
you know? Are you sure you want this?
It's charged at certain cost. It has that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9767-3
01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:17.854
Wouldn't you know, it had cases.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9773-0
01:26:18.784 --> 01:26:19.784
Yes, yeah, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9813-0
01:26:19.824 --> 01:26:25.625
They are signing their name that actually
on Crikey. Yeah, I am responsible.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9774-0
01:26:20.744 --> 01:26:23.424
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah, exactly,
exactly.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9813-1
01:26:25.625 --> 01:26:31.201
I've just ordered 100, you know,
100 canopies. I am responsible for that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9813-2
01:26:31.201 --> 01:26:35.872
I mean it. You can't.
We presumably have a directive on waste

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9813-3
01:26:35.872 --> 01:26:37.304
at Ashurst as well.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9834-0
01:26:38.144 --> 01:26:42.914
But you know what to be. Yeah. You know,
you're not meant to be throwing away food

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9834-1
01:26:42.914 --> 01:26:45.557
or wasting things on anything.
And therefore,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9834-2
01:26:45.557 --> 01:26:47.224
they're responsible for that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9879-0
01:26:47.804 --> 01:26:51.909
100 canopies turning up and they
authorise it. You don't even touch it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9839-0
01:26:48.624 --> 01:26:49.464
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9879-1
01:26:51.909 --> 01:26:56.641
If the system sends it to them that from
they're alerted and they have to sign and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9879-2
01:26:56.641 --> 01:26:57.724
unless they sign I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9880-0
01:26:57.724 --> 01:26:57.884
Mean.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9881-0
01:26:58.964 --> 01:27:01.666
It's part of the remit. You can't.
They can't assume that just because

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9881-1
01:27:01.666 --> 01:27:03.797
they've done it,
it's still going to be there when they

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9881-2
01:27:03.797 --> 01:27:05.244
arrive, so they get that notification.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9896-0
01:27:06.024 --> 01:27:09.220
It might not land with one person.
There could be because they might be away,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9896-1
01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:11.064
so it could be an assignment group or the
P.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9898-0
01:27:11.184 --> 01:27:14.665
<v Mark Sedge>But but the other thing that ServiceNow
can do, sorry, Debra,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9898-1
01:27:14.665 --> 01:27:18.089
<v Mark Sedge>just jumping in there,
the other thing they can do is if for</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9898-2
01:27:18.089 --> 01:27:22.468
<v Mark Sedge>whatever reason they're in transit,
they can put a delegate to approve things</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9898-3
01:27:22.468 --> 01:27:25.388
<v Mark Sedge>as well, right?
So that and that's for all types of</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9898-4
01:27:25.388 --> 01:27:29.486
<v Mark Sedge>requests or approvals or anything.
So there's more than one way of which</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9898-5
01:27:29.486 --> 01:27:30.384
<v Mark Sedge>they can ensure.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9901-0
01:27:30.784 --> 01:27:35.110
<v Mark Sedge>And what you can do is when you send out
the notification when they book it,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9901-1
01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:39.603
<v Mark Sedge>what you can do is you can say X amount
of days before you're going to get this</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9901-2
01:27:39.603 --> 01:27:42.243
<v Mark Sedge>you need to be available to approve to
secure.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9901-3
01:27:42.243 --> 01:27:46.400
<v Mark Sedge>So you already tell them in one
notification and then there's no surprise</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9901-4
01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.984
<v Mark Sedge>when the next one arrives for them to
action.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9952-0
01:27:50.254 --> 01:27:54.494
So for us that I've done it and we've
seen another law firm. So let's say I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9953-0
01:27:54.494 --> 01:27:55.054
Book A room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9954-0
01:27:55.654 --> 01:27:58.983
But I have to also give a delegate and
the partner and the PE,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9954-1
01:27:58.983 --> 01:28:02.735
so it's just that like Mark said or like
Deborah said, if I can leave,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9954-2
01:28:02.735 --> 01:28:06.804
we don't want no catering because I'm
sure that's gonna be a problem for you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9944-0
01:28:04.224 --> 01:28:04.424
Mm-hmm.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9954-3
01:28:06.804 --> 01:28:07.174
anyway.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9983-0
01:28:07.974 --> 01:28:11.071
Someone's going to complain,
but at least there's other points of

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9983-1
01:28:11.071 --> 01:28:14.779
contact that they're like. Actually,
it's a bulk e-mail that goes to all four,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9983-2
01:28:14.779 --> 01:28:17.783
and then there's transparency and
ownership, like Deborah said,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9983-3
01:28:17.783 --> 01:28:19.614
on the individual to to make it happen.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/9992-0
01:28:19.984 --> 01:28:22.344
Yeah, I think that would be, you know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10043-0
01:28:20.564 --> 01:28:20.684
The.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10044-0
01:28:22.524 --> 01:28:25.845
In service sound,
it sounds like we've taken that you can

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10044-1
01:28:25.845 --> 01:28:30.312
achieve and have to look at any queries,
but you'll have a dashboard that has

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10044-2
01:28:30.312 --> 01:28:33.404
these. The meetings in 48 hours,
we've heard nothing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10045-0
01:28:33.404 --> 01:28:33.564
You.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10046-0
01:28:34.044 --> 01:28:37.888
Know you get this sort of ageing or
something that gets tomorrow.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10029-0
01:28:34.464 --> 01:28:34.624
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10046-1
01:28:37.888 --> 01:28:41.324
We still need whatever might be.
So you can you still can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10100-0
01:28:41.604 --> 01:28:45.123
Manage that query.
Maybe the approval needs to be 72 hours

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10100-1
01:28:45.123 --> 01:28:49.895
to give catering that window to do it,
but you certainly can have the dashboard

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10100-2
01:28:49.895 --> 01:28:53.593
that says room booked,
outstanding catering approval from the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10100-3
01:28:53.593 --> 01:28:57.172
request you know,
so you've got that ability to manage your

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10100-4
01:28:57.172 --> 01:29:02.004
dashboard with any outstanding actions
that you might need to just intervene on.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10113-0
01:29:02.454 --> 01:29:08.934
Certainly the heavy lifting bit can be
the workflow would be meeting means book.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10150-0
01:29:10.894 --> 01:29:16.238
To the white class client and then the
structure of that catering and on your

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10150-1
01:29:16.238 --> 01:29:21.720
dashboard would be both groups or both
active ready to go checked in everyone's

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10150-2
01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:24.735
happy.
Or you could have meeting room group

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10150-3
01:29:24.735 --> 01:29:26.174
catering outstanding.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10168-0
01:29:27.094 --> 01:29:32.005
Or lecture outstanding facility, you know,
whatever other checklists and you'll see

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10168-1
01:29:32.005 --> 01:29:33.934
all of that as an active package.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10179-0
01:29:34.924 --> 01:29:35.924
But you could check.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10184-0
01:29:35.984 --> 01:29:38.584
From do we know who's running the
facilities?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10186-0
01:29:40.814 --> 01:29:41.614
Oh, is that is that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10204-0
01:29:44.014 --> 01:29:45.574
I mean, without knowing a lot about.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10205-0
01:29:45.574 --> 01:29:46.454
It I actually think.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10206-0
01:29:46.454 --> 01:29:48.574
It would be really beneficial to get.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10208-0
01:29:50.174 --> 01:29:50.294
Off.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10232-0
01:29:51.914 --> 01:29:55.034
Swaroop, I I should pay it. I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10215-0
01:29:52.294 --> 01:29:53.014
The reception.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10233-0
01:29:55.074 --> 01:29:58.114
Just because you think dashboard.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10244-0
01:29:56.454 --> 01:29:56.494
I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10245-0
01:29:56.734 --> 01:30:00.045
It is.
There is a thought process of why would

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10245-1
01:30:00.045 --> 01:30:04.694
you know what? I'm busy enough.
There's no scope for change, but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10306-0
01:30:05.414 --> 01:30:08.038
Showcasing actually the like you just
said,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10306-1
01:30:08.038 --> 01:30:13.047
you get notified and get notified that we
are amazing and actually you can start to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10306-2
01:30:13.047 --> 01:30:17.699
add value rather than just firefighting.
We have to start to add value to the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10306-3
01:30:17.699 --> 01:30:18.534
whole service.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10307-0
01:30:18.854 --> 01:30:20.054
Evenly reporting and stuff.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10308-0
01:30:20.054 --> 01:30:21.974
Yeah,
that's easier than what they've got and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10289-0
01:30:20.444 --> 01:30:21.124
Yeah, it's watching.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10309-0
01:30:21.974 --> 01:30:22.534
Now you're going.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10310-0
01:30:22.534 --> 01:30:23.654
To literally as you said through.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10301-0
01:30:23.214 --> 01:30:23.414
Mm-hmm.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10311-0
01:30:23.654 --> 01:30:26.094
Ordinance and we get to some of those
reports.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10320-0
01:30:26.694 --> 01:30:30.654
Talks and yeah, yeah,
all of that which I was reading.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10339-0
01:30:33.054 --> 01:30:39.716
But definitely because I was when we were
looking at the indication for obviously

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10339-1
01:30:39.716 --> 01:30:40.854
communication.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10373-0
01:30:42.454 --> 01:30:47.281
Overview That reception can't see each
other, so they don't. They can't see each,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10373-1
01:30:47.281 --> 01:30:50.871
so they always can through eyes to see OK,
what's happening.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10373-2
01:30:50.871 --> 01:30:55.581
So if they were able to view initially
request to take care all the information

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10373-3
01:30:55.581 --> 01:30:55.934
again.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10392-0
01:30:56.804 --> 01:30:58.979
The fact that that, that question,
we said,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10380-0
01:30:56.824 --> 01:30:58.024
And then you know the question.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10392-1
01:30:58.979 --> 01:31:02.044
what question text you know if someone is
raising a question.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10386-0
01:31:00.864 --> 01:31:01.064
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10444-0
01:31:02.094 --> 01:31:05.289
What's happening?
There's a there's a case to be made that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10444-1
01:31:05.289 --> 01:31:09.620
they should have service now because they
could just go in the morning. No, no,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10444-2
01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:13.844
it will give any information of what's
happening and it should, their rights.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10418-0
01:31:13.144 --> 01:31:13.824
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, and.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10444-3
01:31:13.844 --> 01:31:17.743
They don't. They can't change,
they can't edit them, can't modify them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10444-4
01:31:17.743 --> 01:31:22.183
But that question that comes up front,
what's happening is alleviated. It's gone.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10444-5
01:31:22.183 --> 01:31:22.454
They.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10454-0
01:31:22.894 --> 01:31:25.934
We can go in self-service,
answer their own questions.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10455-0
01:31:25.544 --> 01:31:26.144
Exactly.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10453-0
01:31:26.544 --> 01:31:26.864
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10477-0
01:31:27.854 --> 01:31:31.654
Again, make any changes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10461-0
01:31:31.784 --> 01:31:32.584
Yeah, again.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10478-0
01:31:32.574 --> 01:31:37.214
No need for an e-mail to come through to
our team to go and find out.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10472-0
01:31:37.944 --> 01:31:38.144
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10479-0
01:31:38.054 --> 01:31:39.654
What they have? Yep.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10491-0
01:31:42.304 --> 01:31:44.544
That would be really good.
You're at the facilities.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10490-0
01:31:45.774 --> 01:31:46.094
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10505-0
01:31:50.304 --> 01:31:54.250
That would be,
especially when it comes to Kate and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10505-1
01:31:54.250 --> 01:31:55.464
reception, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10511-0
01:31:56.154 --> 01:31:57.234
Yes, actually that was.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10514-0
01:31:58.684 --> 01:31:59.524
So we've got.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10516-0
01:31:59.024 --> 01:32:01.652
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, we'd what?
What you'd established for,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10516-1
01:32:01.652 --> 01:32:04.222
<v Mark Sedge>though you'd have unique controlled
groups.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10516-2
01:32:04.222 --> 01:32:08.777
<v Mark Sedge>So they've been like a user group who
would have read only type permission to</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10516-3
01:32:08.777 --> 01:32:13.740
<v Mark Sedge>be able to view and self assess, you know,
because Katie would want to see different</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10516-4
01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:17.828
<v Mark Sedge>things for the receptionist, probably.
And what have you or you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10516-5
01:32:17.828 --> 01:32:18.704
<v Mark Sedge>so you'd you'd.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10519-0
01:32:18.784 --> 01:32:22.896
<v Mark Sedge>Should be able to cater,
so no pun intended for those specific</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10519-1
01:32:22.896 --> 01:32:27.661
<v Mark Sedge>needs of what they want to view.
And then what ServiceNow can do is make</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10519-2
01:32:27.661 --> 01:32:31.904
<v Mark Sedge>available to specific tables or data that
they only need to see.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10535-0
01:32:33.504 --> 01:32:37.664
Anybody that's asking you a question,
what's happening, they can leave.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10552-0
01:32:37.784 --> 01:32:42.749
That's a good case for them to, yeah,
to be honest. Yeah. So I know we've.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10552-1
01:32:42.749 --> 01:32:43.544
I mean, I'm.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10553-0
01:32:43.984 --> 01:32:44.584
We are talking.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10576-0
01:32:44.584 --> 01:32:47.864
To each other process and we didn't want
it to be line by line because these

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10576-1
01:32:47.864 --> 01:32:50.462
stories are great.
They sort of promote these conversations,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10585-0
01:32:47.944 --> 01:32:48.584
I guess you're.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10586-0
01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:53.505
Thinking about it,
because you don't actually from from you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10576-2
01:32:50.462 --> 01:32:51.144
which you won't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10586-1
01:32:53.505 --> 01:32:55.504
guys not knowing what the process is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10588-0
01:32:57.664 --> 01:32:58.624
For the stories.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10628-0
01:32:59.994 --> 01:33:03.894
Yeah, I know I'm not. You're talking.
I'm thinking about scenarios where I have

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10628-1
01:33:03.894 --> 01:33:06.673
friends that you might turn up to a
restaurant. They go,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10628-2
01:33:06.673 --> 01:33:09.306
that's they want my table.
Can they ask them to move?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10628-3
01:33:09.306 --> 01:33:12.280
I can't ask them to move with my table.
You know, there are.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10628-4
01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:14.474
You can bring it to life that I can
imagine.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10656-0
01:33:15.264 --> 01:33:18.064
That it's not as easy as it's, you know,
appears have you?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10657-0
01:33:18.064 --> 01:33:21.994
Seen the the we work room book in logic
system. Yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10657-1
01:33:21.994 --> 01:33:26.944
there's a very credit based some amount
of star the month purchase.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10668-0
01:33:28.434 --> 01:33:30.649
And things like that.
But it's obviously a bit different

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10668-1
01:33:30.649 --> 01:33:31.154
because it's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10672-0
01:33:30.874 --> 01:33:32.754
That might like land like a legend.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10676-0
01:33:34.064 --> 01:33:35.344
Upwards of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10689-0
01:33:37.464 --> 01:33:40.124
Yes, I paid for.
I can imagine there was some

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10689-1
01:33:40.124 --> 01:33:41.744
conversations that happened.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10705-0
01:33:41.184 --> 01:33:44.474
Can you actually in London,
we do have prices.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10705-1
01:33:44.474 --> 01:33:47.904
So I have accurate prices,
I can't remember off.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10696-0
01:33:46.574 --> 01:33:47.014
Oh yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10712-0
01:33:48.274 --> 01:33:52.634
Without the fact that that price exists
is a, you know that it's already been.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10725-0
01:33:54.184 --> 01:33:56.504
It's been given a currency.
It could be very powerful.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10728-0
01:33:55.104 --> 01:33:56.944
I think I'm going to. I'm going to two.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10729-0
01:33:56.944 --> 01:33:57.984
150 yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10734-0
01:33:58.304 --> 01:33:59.224
Yeah, for like the larger.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10756-0
01:34:01.694 --> 01:34:04.400
Yeah, that fact.
The fact that that exists,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10756-1
01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:09.383
we could systemize that to put it in to
give a value to a room that really see a

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10756-2
01:34:09.383 --> 01:34:09.814
lot of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10757-0
01:34:09.814 --> 01:34:10.374
People do but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10782-0
01:34:12.504 --> 01:34:16.716
It's. It's weird, right?
So the people who put these rooms are

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10782-1
01:34:16.716 --> 01:34:21.664
essentially they own the office.
So it's like the landlord kind of thing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10784-0
01:34:19.994 --> 01:34:23.074
Right. Yes. OK, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10785-0
01:34:23.584 --> 01:34:23.664
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10789-0
01:34:25.224 --> 01:34:26.104
I don't actually know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10800-0
01:34:27.784 --> 01:34:29.642
Like that,
your average person can put cash.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10800-1
01:34:29.642 --> 01:34:30.344
I don't think so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10823-0
01:34:30.974 --> 01:34:35.029
I would imagine client confidential
immunity to be able to walk around an

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10815-0
01:34:32.374 --> 01:34:35.054
Yes, I love this.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10823-1
01:34:35.029 --> 01:34:37.934
office and start to hear the conversation
and so on.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10835-0
01:34:36.804 --> 01:34:39.804
Party these people with the cold black
friends.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10842-0
01:34:39.914 --> 01:34:40.834
Right. OK. So they'll.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10843-0
01:34:40.834 --> 01:34:43.234
They'll probably you would have fresh
fields or.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10844-0
01:34:43.314 --> 01:34:44.874
No EMS coming in to regular.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10852-0
01:34:46.704 --> 01:34:48.224
Happened. No, they don't actually.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10855-0
01:34:48.304 --> 01:34:49.464
Actually, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10858-0
01:34:50.264 --> 01:34:50.424
Have.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10871-0
01:34:53.504 --> 01:34:55.384
Clients that come through to us, to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10872-0
01:34:55.384 --> 01:34:57.824
Book rooms,
but there's no ashfast employees.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10881-0
01:35:00.544 --> 01:35:03.394
But again,
they've got to come through a PE and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10906-0
01:35:01.344 --> 01:35:02.224
OK, so I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10881-1
01:35:03.394 --> 01:35:04.344
that's going to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10907-0
01:35:04.624 --> 01:35:07.262
Think we've got external? Yeah,
if we could just say so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10907-1
01:35:07.262 --> 01:35:10.224
Internal rooms is great.
We've got this hyper path where we've.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10908-0
01:35:10.224 --> 01:35:10.544
Got.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10909-0
01:35:11.064 --> 01:35:13.744
The scenarios where you might have.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10914-0
01:35:14.664 --> 01:35:16.944
Client internal multi room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10936-0
01:35:18.624 --> 01:35:23.227
One off block booking probably and we can
put some walls in there.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10920-0
01:35:20.834 --> 01:35:21.034
Mm-hmm.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10936-1
01:35:23.227 --> 01:35:24.464
It's all my fault.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10945-0
01:35:24.024 --> 01:35:27.442
You said. See my face? Yeah,
that would be. That would be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10945-1
01:35:27.442 --> 01:35:31.904
It would have to be a managed face.
Rows in place. Yes. Yeah. And approvals.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10972-0
01:35:31.744 --> 01:35:35.328
Yes, exactly.
So we've got all those scenarios which we

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10972-1
01:35:35.328 --> 01:35:40.320
can put some rules around based on you
know your templates and values can and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/10972-2
01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:43.904
the assets you construct that and then
they get booked.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11009-0
01:35:45.744 --> 01:35:48.674
So the query comes into you,
they get booked,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11009-1
01:35:48.674 --> 01:35:53.259
no approval required is there?
Is there additional information that you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11009-2
01:35:53.259 --> 01:35:57.272
populate on that query?
I'm talking now that if they populated

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11009-3
01:35:57.272 --> 01:36:00.584
what you need them to populate,
do you do anything?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11014-0
01:36:01.504 --> 01:36:02.624
Additional to embellish that data.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11031-0
01:36:03.174 --> 01:36:07.854
It's not that we would go and advocate
and services.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11032-0
01:36:07.854 --> 01:36:09.614
And you don't need to know who's on the
invite.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11033-0
01:36:09.614 --> 01:36:12.254
At that or you need to know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11048-0
01:36:13.824 --> 01:36:14.184
Do you need?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11049-0
01:36:14.184 --> 01:36:14.304
The.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11050-0
01:36:14.304 --> 01:36:18.150
Chair, we need the Vienna. Yeah.
So we always need the Vienna. OK?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11050-1
01:36:18.150 --> 01:36:19.184
It's just because.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11084-0
01:36:20.824 --> 01:36:24.354
The people committed course quotes and
telecos course. OK,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11084-1
01:36:24.354 --> 01:36:28.543
so please we have an issue.
We have the P ES we're booking the rooms,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11084-2
01:36:28.543 --> 01:36:32.612
but we're advocating even though when
they give us this cost quote,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11084-3
01:36:32.612 --> 01:36:35.904
this cost quote is 18 via operations
department, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11092-0
01:36:37.654 --> 01:36:40.134
Transactions. It should have been yes. OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11094-0
01:36:39.784 --> 01:36:40.384
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11099-0
01:36:42.904 --> 01:36:44.864
Once the MRI system is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11145-0
01:36:47.224 --> 01:36:50.983
Three,
which means we would have male's

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11145-1
01:36:50.983 --> 01:36:56.246
department maybe? Yeah.
So it's just the question those

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11145-2
01:36:56.246 --> 01:36:58.784
department, yeah, the city.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11146-0
01:36:59.104 --> 01:37:01.864
Copy transactions which should have been
sure so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11147-0
01:37:02.104 --> 01:37:04.971
So we need to, yeah.
Now that is like probably one of the most.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11147-1
01:37:04.971 --> 01:37:06.584
Again, I can put that in any e-mail.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11160-0
01:37:06.664 --> 01:37:10.162
So this is called the client here,
but I'm thinking, yeah, OK, so 5 minutes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11151-0
01:37:08.064 --> 01:37:08.424
Yeah. So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11160-1
01:37:10.162 --> 01:37:11.344
You need to be early, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11180-0
01:37:11.734 --> 01:37:15.534
With internal,
if you're talking about like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11181-0
01:37:15.694 --> 01:37:16.854
Let's give us food.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11174-0
01:37:15.944 --> 01:37:17.104
I just want to book A room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11182-0
01:37:17.214 --> 01:37:19.974
Yeah, I would. I would probably say.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11190-0
01:37:22.304 --> 01:37:23.504
A lot of time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11189-0
01:37:22.594 --> 01:37:23.234
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11226-0
01:37:25.784 --> 01:37:30.051
But if it's one if I'm just booking it,
I've come to the office. I want to work.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11226-1
01:37:30.051 --> 01:37:32.686
I, you know,
I possibly want to have a one to one

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11226-2
01:37:32.686 --> 01:37:35.900
meeting with Josh.
We're going to talk about a project, but,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11226-3
01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:39.324
you know, quite space.
Do you need any additional information at

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11226-4
01:37:39.324 --> 01:37:39.904
that point?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11256-0
01:37:39.424 --> 01:37:44.708
I know if it's not a man in space,
so a man space would be things we care

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11256-1
01:37:44.708 --> 01:37:48.279
about you.
So if they don't need a managed space,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11256-2
01:37:48.279 --> 01:37:52.064
essentially we don't need any more
information than.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11278-0
01:37:53.704 --> 01:37:54.424
Attendees contain.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11279-0
01:37:54.984 --> 01:37:56.264
So you do need attendees.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11281-0
01:37:56.264 --> 01:37:59.972
It would do it, yeah. OK.
And for the client ones as well.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11276-0
01:37:57.074 --> 01:37:59.674
Yes, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11281-1
01:37:59.972 --> 01:38:01.104
Attendees. OK, OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11295-0
01:38:01.464 --> 01:38:04.712
So is that mainly just for London or like,
see if it's Glasgow?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11295-1
01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:06.184
Do you still need the Costco?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11308-0
01:38:07.784 --> 01:38:08.304
Again.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11312-0
01:38:10.074 --> 01:38:12.714
But I think we're looking at
standardising if you're doing it then.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11359-0
01:38:12.744 --> 01:38:14.971
Because what what I'm thinking is like,
see,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11359-1
01:38:14.971 --> 01:38:17.990
we had a form for looking at a room or a
space or like Mark,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11333-0
01:38:17.494 --> 01:38:18.894
The upfront? Yeah. Check.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11359-2
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:21.802
would we be better to have like a drop
down for like location whether it was

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11359-3
01:38:21.802 --> 01:38:25.860
Glasgow and then it feels stiffer if it's
Glasgow because we really don't need as

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11359-4
01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:26.504
much because.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11360-0
01:38:27.104 --> 01:38:27.704
I'm thinking if.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11361-0
01:38:27.704 --> 01:38:29.504
We have Mang, which, if we just have one.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11386-0
01:38:30.314 --> 01:38:30.994
One form and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11387-0
01:38:31.474 --> 01:38:33.434
Then we have mandatory fields.
A lot of them might.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11388-0
01:38:33.434 --> 01:38:34.354
Not be applicable for the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11405-0
01:38:34.144 --> 01:38:37.335
Yeah, we can invite your share. So yeah,
if we do. I mean,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11389-0
01:38:34.354 --> 01:38:35.954
Ave or something you're struggling to?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11405-1
01:38:37.335 --> 01:38:41.283
it sounds like we've got complex.
So like we did complex learning and we

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11405-2
01:38:41.283 --> 01:38:41.824
did build.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11408-0
01:38:43.664 --> 01:38:44.464
I'm trying to add something.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11417-0
01:38:46.704 --> 01:38:48.064
We have another type of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11435-0
01:38:48.304 --> 01:38:52.304
Yes. So we can add in another office,
so yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11436-0
01:38:52.304 --> 01:38:54.144
It's going to be scalable, so yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11443-0
01:38:54.054 --> 01:38:56.814
Because we've been taking over Alice
Perkins next year, OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11452-0
01:38:56.044 --> 01:39:00.855
It's like, yeah, OK, great.
So and that was one of my. Yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11446-0
01:38:56.424 --> 01:38:59.624
<v Mark Sedge>So yeah, if if your facilities.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11452-1
01:39:00.855 --> 01:39:01.644
sorry mum.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11454-0
01:39:00.984 --> 01:39:05.566
<v Mark Sedge>If all if all of the offices, if, if,
when we talk to facilities with we'll</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11454-1
01:39:05.566 --> 01:39:10.569
<v Mark Sedge>establish this, I'm sure. Right. But yeah.
If they have all of the offices and all</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11454-2
01:39:10.569 --> 01:39:15.513
<v Mark Sedge>of the meeting rooms that are in each of
those offices you can scale it right out</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11454-3
01:39:15.513 --> 01:39:17.984
<v Mark Sedge>because the pick list will be the office.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11457-0
01:39:18.464 --> 01:39:23.755
<v Mark Sedge>You know they will literally Scroll down
their type in Brisbane office and their</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11457-1
01:39:23.755 --> 01:39:28.719
<v Mark Sedge>type meeting room or their select their
by their criteria it would pop up a</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11457-2
01:39:28.719 --> 01:39:33.684
<v Mark Sedge>Brisbane meeting room of X size of X
construct to enable them to run right.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11457-3
01:39:33.684 --> 01:39:37.864
<v Mark Sedge>So you know if by having a single form
with the your pick list.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11460-0
01:39:38.664 --> 01:39:41.527
<v Mark Sedge>It it? Yeah.
And and many being appropriately</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11460-1
01:39:41.527 --> 01:39:44.453
<v Mark Sedge>mandatory,
you know to to steer your audience.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11460-2
01:39:44.453 --> 01:39:49.495
<v Mark Sedge>You've got a scalable solution that you
can absolutely rely upon and that's what</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11460-3
01:39:49.495 --> 01:39:50.864
<v Mark Sedge>we want to get you to.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11489-0
01:39:51.804 --> 01:39:55.162
And I think we're just saying, Mark,
that there's some things that you want to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11489-1
01:39:55.162 --> 01:39:58.095
hide and show that the fact that Glasgow
don't have these scenarios,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11489-2
01:39:58.095 --> 01:40:01.284
you don't want them to fill in stuff
that's not applicable, but certainly.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11491-0
01:40:00.664 --> 01:40:00.904
<v Mark Sedge>Play song.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11493-0
01:40:00.944 --> 01:40:04.576
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So if they exactly.
So if they pick Glasgow's their location,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11493-1
01:40:04.576 --> 01:40:07.887
<v Mark Sedge>then a whole load of options just won't
materialise for them.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11493-2
01:40:07.887 --> 01:40:12.106
<v Mark Sedge>Whereas if they pick London then they
might get a whole load more depending on</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11493-3
01:40:12.106 --> 01:40:15.150
<v Mark Sedge>what's on that site and if they pick New
York, you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11493-4
01:40:15.150 --> 01:40:19.636
<v Mark Sedge>they might have instead of I know canapes.
They might have bagels. I'll make it up,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11493-5
01:40:19.636 --> 01:40:20.864
<v Mark Sedge>right, but you get the.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11495-0
01:40:20.944 --> 01:40:25.248
<v Mark Sedge>Yes, you can. Pretty much.
You can pretty much by location,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11495-1
01:40:25.248 --> 01:40:29.264
<v Mark Sedge>flag and control anything by the rules
that you define.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11523-0
01:40:29.744 --> 01:40:32.664
OK.
And all the projects I worked on in

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11523-1
01:40:32.664 --> 01:40:36.022
Africa,
we obviously have French speaking and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11523-2
01:40:36.022 --> 01:40:39.453
English.
So even though the the sort of system

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11523-3
01:40:39.453 --> 01:40:43.104
fields behind the scenes are one default
English.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11547-0
01:40:43.904 --> 01:40:46.970
Your display fields depending on whose
entry, it'll be French or English,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11547-1
01:40:46.970 --> 01:40:49.498
so it doesn't need.
I mean we might have just say everything

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11547-2
01:40:49.498 --> 01:40:50.824
in Azure since it's universally.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11561-0
01:40:52.424 --> 01:40:56.408
English language but there is that
ability in ServiceNow to have language

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11561-1
01:40:56.408 --> 01:40:59.424
options as a displayed field as well if
that helps but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11575-0
01:41:01.534 --> 01:41:05.374
Yeah. Yeah, that's certainly something.
I don't know. What's the other projects.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11598-0
01:41:07.064 --> 01:41:09.791
Mark,
I don't really discussing displaying

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11598-1
01:41:09.791 --> 01:41:13.025
language,
but that could be set depending on who's

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11598-2
01:41:13.025 --> 01:41:17.464
logged in that there that's displayed in
there native language store.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11602-0
01:41:16.384 --> 01:41:20.456
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, these are these are.
I think we've got we've got a couple of,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11599-0
01:41:17.124 --> 01:41:17.364
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11602-1
01:41:20.456 --> 01:41:24.707
<v Mark Sedge>we've got a couple of items that cut
right across all of our workshops</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11602-2
01:41:24.707 --> 01:41:27.760
<v Mark Sedge>etcetera.
One of them's the time time display kind</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11602-3
01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:30.694
<v Mark Sedge>of criteria.
What time zone do we display in and</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11601-0
01:41:28.704 --> 01:41:28.944
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11602-4
01:41:30.694 --> 01:41:33.928
<v Mark Sedge>what's the core language that gets
displayed as well?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11602-5
01:41:33.928 --> 01:41:35.544
<v Mark Sedge>And and you know are there.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11605-0
01:41:35.624 --> 01:41:40.456
<v Mark Sedge>Any local settings where they might
leverage local translation,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11605-1
01:41:40.456 --> 01:41:46.195
<v Mark Sedge>but ultimately we have those two broader
decisions to make. And it's funny,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11605-2
01:41:46.195 --> 01:41:50.121
<v Mark Sedge>actually,
I was this morning I was pinging parek to</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11605-3
01:41:50.121 --> 01:41:55.104
<v Mark Sedge>to he's our architect to see what what's
the what's the timeline?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11609-0
01:41:55.184 --> 01:41:58.197
<v Mark Sedge>Of bottoming that out because it it will
matter.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11609-1
01:41:58.197 --> 01:42:02.378
<v Mark Sedge>Because if I'm in one time zone and I'm
say I'm flying into London,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11609-2
01:42:02.378 --> 01:42:06.681
<v Mark Sedge>I want to book my meeting room.
I want to be booking it in the right.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11609-3
01:42:06.681 --> 01:42:09.509
<v Mark Sedge>Do you know what I mean?
With the right time,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11609-4
01:42:09.509 --> 01:42:11.784
<v Mark Sedge>time zone to work when I land. Right.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11644-0
01:42:11.584 --> 01:42:14.913
Or else, yeah, yeah, to pay.
But all of that's there.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11644-1
01:42:14.913 --> 01:42:19.414
So it's I think 1, you might have saw it.
I think I might have mentioned

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11644-2
01:42:19.414 --> 01:42:22.744
scalability.
These are the things that we're thinking

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11644-3
01:42:22.744 --> 01:42:25.704
about. But it's not just confined to 123,
it's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11671-0
01:42:27.104 --> 01:42:30.699
You can onboard another office,
but not taking four weeks to onboard and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11671-1
01:42:30.699 --> 01:42:34.589
you're on board. You're ready to go.
ServiceNow is great at that cookie cutter

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11671-2
01:42:34.589 --> 01:42:38.184
and you don't have to spend weeks
configuring your it's scalable option.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11674-0
01:42:40.984 --> 01:42:41.664
So we've got.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11720-0
01:42:42.334 --> 01:42:47.173
I think we've discussed quite a lot today
room, different options,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11720-1
01:42:47.173 --> 01:42:52.879
multiple multi block booking rules on 24
hours and then goes catering and then

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11720-2
01:42:52.879 --> 01:42:56.491
post complete presumably that it could
just bulk,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11720-3
01:42:56.491 --> 01:43:02.414
you know if time effective end date of
room is done, they're just close complete.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11744-0
01:43:03.374 --> 01:43:06.954
In Cheryl today that you have to
physically once it's booked,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11744-1
01:43:06.954 --> 01:43:10.014
it's closed or do you keep it open after
the ending?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11750-0
01:43:09.804 --> 01:43:12.063
Silly. Sorry.
Closed it once we confirmed it and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11750-1
01:43:12.063 --> 01:43:12.524
basically.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11755-0
01:43:12.464 --> 01:43:13.744
OK. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11754-0
01:43:14.304 --> 01:43:14.624
Added it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11799-0
01:43:16.424 --> 01:43:21.053
I think it could be that you keep that
open until and the system automatically

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11799-1
01:43:21.053 --> 01:43:25.741
closes for you because you might have
subtasks that come about that you need to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11799-2
01:43:25.741 --> 01:43:28.906
trigger to facilities that you know we
arrived today.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11799-3
01:43:28.906 --> 01:43:33.301
Actually the screen was broken and
whatever would be that you need to have

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11799-4
01:43:33.301 --> 01:43:35.704
some other activities that come came out.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11833-0
01:43:36.214 --> 01:43:41.090
As a result of the people arriving in the
room or there was no catering,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11833-1
01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:46.501
you know they could be that it doesn't
close until after the 4:00 PM end date of

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11833-2
01:43:46.501 --> 01:43:49.574
that meeting. If you need it.
If you need it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11855-0
01:43:49.074 --> 01:43:51.956
Yeah,
I think because we do take bookings like

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11855-1
01:43:51.956 --> 01:43:55.514
so far something's in advance.
I think for a while, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11884-0
01:43:53.344 --> 01:43:57.224
I mean, I mean they.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11885-0
01:43:57.224 --> 01:44:00.637
Would sit there. You won't see them.
They don't need to be displayed,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11885-1
01:44:00.637 --> 01:44:04.537
but it's something that maybe to think
about that they could just be confirmed.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11885-2
01:44:04.537 --> 01:44:07.462
That's the workflow.
But they get closed complete after the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11885-3
01:44:07.462 --> 01:44:10.144
event. So that if you needed to go in,
you can see it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11914-0
01:44:10.944 --> 01:44:15.207
You could add that room didn't work on
that day because power cut. You know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11914-1
01:44:15.207 --> 01:44:19.139
you could do with calls on it and then
you can just use those metrics.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11914-2
01:44:19.139 --> 01:44:22.904
I mean it's just an ability.
ServiceNow does give you that ability.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11961-0
01:44:23.554 --> 01:44:27.255
That you could do some additional reports
along that route or client,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11961-1
01:44:27.255 --> 01:44:30.746
you know cancelled because cancelled on
the morning because yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11961-2
01:44:30.746 --> 01:44:34.817
and you start to get some metrics then
you can say to that client go back to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11961-3
01:44:34.817 --> 01:44:37.567
that partner,
you've actually cancelled the dentist

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11961-4
01:44:37.567 --> 01:44:40.476
three times in a row.
Now you're not having that room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11961-5
01:44:40.476 --> 01:44:42.274
You know you can use it for those.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11966-0
01:44:43.024 --> 01:44:43.224
Those things.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11971-0
01:44:43.394 --> 01:44:44.954
You do anything that I at the moment.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/11976-0
01:44:44.984 --> 01:44:45.904
Cancellation fees.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12004-0
01:44:46.664 --> 01:44:51.366
Thought in terms of reporting like in
rooms and stuff like that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12004-1
01:44:51.366 --> 01:44:56.791
I'm so I would probably do all the team
she wanted to access that as well.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12004-2
01:44:56.791 --> 01:45:00.264
So basically we want to know who's booked
what.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12023-0
01:45:01.664 --> 01:45:06.061
Is the usage of that room and what would
that last year?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12023-1
01:45:06.061 --> 01:45:08.144
What services to that room?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12024-0
01:45:08.624 --> 01:45:09.544
So thanks for that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12025-0
01:45:09.704 --> 01:45:11.264
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12036-0
01:45:12.094 --> 01:45:14.934
I use pypm again. Which one?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12043-0
01:45:18.904 --> 01:45:20.584
People want to know what you can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12044-0
01:45:20.584 --> 01:45:21.704
Get their own pair.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12083-0
01:45:23.304 --> 01:45:28.104
So yeah, I'm just going to share my night.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12084-0
01:45:28.104 --> 01:45:28.544
Yeah, but we.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12085-0
01:45:28.544 --> 01:45:28.664
Can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12086-0
01:45:29.144 --> 01:45:32.686
Certainly have that. I mean,
I'm sort of particular that when you go

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12086-1
01:45:32.686 --> 01:45:35.560
into a room,
it's left how you would expect to find it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12086-2
01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:38.384
So you can almost add on that room.
That room is left.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12096-0
01:45:39.224 --> 01:45:40.864
You know, whatever would be it was 1.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12094-0
01:45:40.144 --> 01:45:40.424
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12097-0
01:45:40.864 --> 01:45:41.904
Really good photo section.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12112-0
01:45:42.264 --> 01:45:50.224
Yeah, but it was left, you know,
debilitated, TSH and lunch behind.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12117-0
01:45:52.824 --> 01:45:53.704
I think it's an important.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12154-0
01:45:54.154 --> 01:45:57.146
You know,
modelling behaviour goes across that you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12154-1
01:45:57.146 --> 01:46:00.315
tidy up, you know,
leave it as you expect to find it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12154-2
01:46:00.315 --> 01:46:03.190
So they might.
So that could be also part of the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12154-3
01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:07.004
reimburking. But you know,
as part of that close, complete left,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12154-4
01:46:07.004 --> 01:46:09.234
you know, with no damage, no meds, no.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12194-0
01:46:10.544 --> 01:46:11.464
How often has that happened?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12195-0
01:46:12.424 --> 01:46:14.744
I rarely find it in professional service.
That's one.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12196-0
01:46:15.464 --> 01:46:19.977
Oh, you'll be surprised. I would.
I think it happens if I go into a remote.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12196-1
01:46:19.977 --> 01:46:21.224
Who was in here last.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12197-0
01:46:21.384 --> 01:46:22.104
Really.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12198-0
01:46:22.184 --> 01:46:23.984
You know, the probably actually were.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12199-0
01:46:24.304 --> 01:46:27.384
Technology for me,
going and something's not working.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12205-0
01:46:32.944 --> 01:46:33.744
In terms of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12207-0
01:46:35.504 --> 01:46:36.024
Like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12209-0
01:46:37.784 --> 01:46:37.944
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12221-0
01:46:42.304 --> 01:46:47.344
So the teams again, see, that's finished.
I'm going to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12231-0
01:46:50.184 --> 01:46:51.104
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12228-0
01:46:51.144 --> 01:46:52.504
Through it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12242-0
01:46:56.024 --> 01:46:56.584
But it might be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12243-0
01:46:56.584 --> 01:46:58.744
Useful to know. Yeah,
you know they didn't have.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12239-0
01:46:56.734 --> 01:46:57.054
But mm-hmm.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12237-0
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.790
<v Mark Sedge>So.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12281-0
01:46:59.384 --> 01:47:02.297
Yeah, that would have been nice to know.
You know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12281-1
01:47:02.297 --> 01:47:06.124
they could be that catering could close
out the ticket with notes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12281-2
01:47:06.124 --> 01:47:09.551
It was left left good state. You know,
I'm just surprising,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12281-3
01:47:09.551 --> 01:47:13.207
but I think it's again,
some insights that you get on behaviour

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12280-0
01:47:12.424 --> 01:47:12.704
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12281-4
01:47:13.207 --> 01:47:13.664
as well.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12284-0
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:17.947
<v Mark Sedge>So in your reporting,
just to play that through in your</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12284-1
01:47:17.947 --> 01:47:21.568
<v Mark Sedge>reporting, when you report occupancy,
usage utilisation,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12284-2
01:47:21.568 --> 01:47:26.397
<v Mark Sedge>do you also catch where for example,
you have over demand say on rooms with</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12284-3
01:47:26.397 --> 01:47:30.590
<v Mark Sedge>you know monitors and other bits and
pieces. So where people are?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12288-0
01:47:31.230 --> 01:47:35.001
<v Mark Sedge>So I do at the end of a.
Someone's had used that room.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12288-1
01:47:35.001 --> 01:47:38.018
<v Mark Sedge>Or do you ever do random surveys,
you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12288-2
01:47:38.018 --> 01:47:43.504
<v Mark Sedge>or do you track that when you weren't
able to provide that person the room with</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12288-3
01:47:43.504 --> 01:47:48.852
<v Mark Sedge>all of the things that they require,
because sometimes that can help you look</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12288-4
01:47:48.852 --> 01:47:50.430
<v Mark Sedge>at it to say, actually?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12290-0
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:53.732
<v Mark Sedge>When we look at our building,
when we look at,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12290-1
01:47:53.732 --> 01:47:57.809
<v Mark Sedge>you know stock in the room,
we might actually put monitors on the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12290-2
01:47:57.809 --> 01:48:01.206
<v Mark Sedge>screen or you have free standing monitors
or wheel up.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12290-3
01:48:01.206 --> 01:48:05.900
<v Mark Sedge>Sometimes you can do wheel up monitors
and portable lectors and lectins and</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12290-4
01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:06.950
<v Mark Sedge>things like that.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12293-0
01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:12.930
<v Mark Sedge>Do you ever have those scenarios where
you track and therefore can you make a</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12293-1
01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:18.310
<v Mark Sedge>room ad hoc like a formal setup with
temporary Cook kit and things like that?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12327-0
01:48:19.394 --> 01:48:24.931
Don't track the ones that we don't have,
so the vast for a laptop, et cetera.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12327-1
01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:28.907
We wouldn't track that.
The system doesn't give us that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12327-2
01:48:28.907 --> 01:48:32.669
information,
but we can track who's used the laptop,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12327-3
01:48:32.669 --> 01:48:35.154
etcetera and most things like that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12334-0
01:48:36.344 --> 01:48:39.784
Again, sometimes services get cancelled.
Oh.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12344-0
01:48:42.584 --> 01:48:47.264
OK, the screen's just spinning.
Sorry that we.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12336-0
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:45.150
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah, I can still hear you.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12347-0
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:51.990
<v Mark Sedge>Nothing, nothing to do with me,
I promise you.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12363-0
01:48:52.104 --> 01:48:56.066
I'll just clarify,
but but are you saying that assets belong

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12363-1
01:48:56.066 --> 01:48:58.664
to a room to track that mobility of the?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12365-0
01:48:57.870 --> 01:49:00.624
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
because because if you to pick it up on</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12365-1
01:49:00.624 --> 01:49:05.534
<v Mark Sedge>your point, if you've got kit failures,
say for example you know someone comes in</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12365-2
01:49:05.534 --> 01:49:10.504
<v Mark Sedge>and you know I don't know the USB sockets
on the power packs aren't working thing.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12365-3
01:49:10.504 --> 01:49:15.354
<v Mark Sedge>If you if you get a feedback for and they
can tell you stuff that enables you to</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12365-4
01:49:15.354 --> 01:49:17.510
<v Mark Sedge>fix it before the next ones come in.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12368-0
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:21.060
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
if someone if someone says the screen was</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12368-1
01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:25.603
<v Mark Sedge>flickering because I don't know that
there was a dodgy USB lead, you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12368-2
01:49:25.603 --> 01:49:30.692
<v Mark Sedge>these are some of the things that you can
then feed into it to sweep up so that the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12368-3
01:49:30.692 --> 01:49:32.510
<v Mark Sedge>next usage is of high quality.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12369-0
01:49:32.830 --> 01:49:33.710
<v Mark Sedge>And what have you, right?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12372-0
01:49:35.134 --> 01:49:36.174
You get inside.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12374-0
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:38.537
<v Mark Sedge>Another sorry, another one too.
While it jumps into another one,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12374-1
01:49:38.537 --> 01:49:42.410
<v Mark Sedge>he's lost and found right because often
when people somebody might leave a Power</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12374-2
01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:44.992
<v Mark Sedge>Pack behind,
someone might left have left their mouse</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12374-3
01:49:44.992 --> 01:49:48.244
<v Mark Sedge>behind or whatever it is.
It also gives you the ability for someone</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12374-4
01:49:48.244 --> 01:49:49.870
<v Mark Sedge>to say, Oh yeah, by the way, I've.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12376-0
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:53.112
<v Mark Sedge>You know, left this or whatever,
and you can,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12376-1
01:49:53.112 --> 01:49:57.804
<v Mark Sedge>I don't know whether you have that
mechanism today that they these items get</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12376-2
01:49:57.804 --> 01:50:00.790
<v Mark Sedge>picked up,
dropped off at reception or whatever.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12394-0
01:50:01.564 --> 01:50:03.804
I think it does cuz I left the cabinet
room in London and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12381-0
01:50:01.734 --> 01:50:01.894
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12395-0
01:50:03.804 --> 01:50:07.724
Went to exception. Yeah, and we found it.
So it's those types of things.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12390-0
01:50:04.464 --> 01:50:04.824
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12399-0
01:50:07.230 --> 01:50:11.156
<v Mark Sedge>So, but there's the point, right? You.
All I'm saying is think about it.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12398-0
01:50:08.984 --> 01:50:09.504
Close, complete.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12399-1
01:50:11.156 --> 01:50:15.567
<v Mark Sedge>There's some additional things that you
could do at close out that helps you prep</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12399-2
01:50:15.567 --> 01:50:16.590
<v Mark Sedge>the room next time.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12456-0
01:50:17.224 --> 01:50:21.137
Yeah, I need to have to go in and go. Oh,
God, I've got to type up.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12403-0
01:50:17.854 --> 01:50:19.134
Would you know what?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12456-1
01:50:21.137 --> 01:50:24.878
But they could just, you know,
if it's if it's dormant after the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12456-2
01:50:24.878 --> 01:50:28.158
effective date close complete within
maybe the same day.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12456-3
01:50:28.158 --> 01:50:32.532
But if they wanted to add some notes
because it was an exceptional case of,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12456-4
01:50:32.532 --> 01:50:35.294
you know,
actually the screen was broken or the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12456-5
01:50:35.294 --> 01:50:37.424
plugs, but whatever it might be that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12462-0
01:50:38.184 --> 01:50:39.744
And the notification.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12477-0
01:50:40.624 --> 01:50:47.064
See the durums? We just find this it.
So the ATM so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12482-0
01:50:48.664 --> 01:50:49.344
Definitely.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12520-0
01:50:49.484 --> 01:50:53.450
Yes, yes, exactly.
So they could be to Mark's point that the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12520-1
01:50:53.450 --> 01:50:58.522
the assets within the room belong to the
room as well. So you don't get that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12520-2
01:50:58.522 --> 01:51:03.138
Who's taken the type of thing.
And so when there's a clean down of the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12520-3
01:51:03.138 --> 01:51:05.284
room or that there's a, you know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12544-0
01:51:06.224 --> 01:51:08.024
Infantry of that sort of you know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12545-0
01:51:08.224 --> 01:51:09.624
Yeah, you send.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12546-0
01:51:09.664 --> 01:51:10.464
Out any like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12547-0
01:51:10.704 --> 01:51:13.304
I don't know is it customer satisfaction
surveys is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12548-0
01:51:13.304 --> 01:51:14.464
That what they're called do you say?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12543-0
01:51:14.104 --> 01:51:14.424
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12556-0
01:51:16.184 --> 01:51:17.904
You didn't have one for sure. Well,
for our team.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12560-0
01:51:19.074 --> 01:51:20.114
So I created one.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12578-0
01:51:22.944 --> 01:51:26.452
I created one and what happens more is
that they would get sent out three days

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12578-1
01:51:26.452 --> 01:51:28.184
after you've booked a meeting room via.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12586-0
01:51:29.334 --> 01:51:31.134
For client only, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12587-0
01:51:31.494 --> 01:51:32.574
OK. Will the client.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12589-0
01:51:32.264 --> 01:51:33.744
It was climate on the floor.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12619-0
01:51:34.464 --> 01:51:37.584
Training maybe? Yeah, absolutely.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12620-0
01:51:37.744 --> 01:51:38.784
And we sent them out.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12621-0
01:51:38.864 --> 01:51:44.225
And then we give feedback to see we don't
have these notification stop them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12621-1
01:51:44.225 --> 01:51:46.384
It's because of our SharePoint.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12627-0
01:51:47.664 --> 01:51:49.424
Like then, we couldn't stop.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12635-0
01:51:50.984 --> 01:51:53.104
That person this evening,
we tend to stop them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12638-0
01:51:55.224 --> 01:51:55.344
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12641-0
01:51:55.230 --> 01:51:59.644
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. So in in ServiceNow.
So in ServiceNow, you module by module,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12640-0
01:51:57.684 --> 01:51:57.964
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12641-1
01:51:59.644 --> 01:52:04.387
<v Mark Sedge>you can select. So as an individual,
you can manage your notifications.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12641-2
01:52:04.387 --> 01:52:08.801
<v Mark Sedge>So you know and that's literally module
by module. So for example,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12641-3
01:52:08.801 --> 01:52:13.874
<v Mark Sedge>if I didn't want to see all the instant
alerts because I was looking at that</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12641-4
01:52:13.874 --> 01:52:14.270
<v Mark Sedge>every.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12644-0
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:18.759
<v Mark Sedge>Everyday I'd turn those ones off,
but if I wanted to see my booking ones</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12644-1
01:52:18.759 --> 01:52:23.573
<v Mark Sedge>and I'd make sure those ones were on.
So it enables you to control through the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12644-2
01:52:23.573 --> 01:52:27.352
<v Mark Sedge>tool and what we would do is we'd have
things like knowledge,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12644-3
01:52:27.352 --> 01:52:32.045
<v Mark Sedge>articles to help folks manage those.
So you don't get notification floods or</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12644-4
01:52:32.045 --> 01:52:33.630
<v Mark Sedge>whatever, but it has that.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12646-0
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:39.009
<v Mark Sedge>Literally it can control module by module
what you see and which notifications you</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12646-1
01:52:39.009 --> 01:52:39.230
<v Mark Sedge>get.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12706-0
01:52:41.234 --> 01:52:42.634
But you would like the customs house.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12707-0
01:52:42.634 --> 01:52:44.394
On yes, because you could trigger.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12708-0
01:52:44.394 --> 01:52:47.499
It so close complete,
you know we're now saying actually you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12708-1
01:52:47.499 --> 01:52:50.146
just closed,
but actually you could just request on

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12708-2
01:52:50.146 --> 01:52:54.270
the system can say or they might you know
they can say do you want to be part of

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12708-3
01:52:54.270 --> 01:52:57.630
the survey to turn it on,
but you could also send it back to them

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12708-4
01:52:57.630 --> 01:53:01.194
to say you know close complete triggers
that survey or you could say.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12739-0
01:53:02.194 --> 01:53:06.074
Manually I'm going to ask them for
satisfaction, but you can let the system.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12740-0
01:53:06.074 --> 01:53:06.274
Do.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12741-0
01:53:06.274 --> 01:53:11.634
That automatically within and then it
comes back into the ServiceNow exactly?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12778-0
01:53:11.124 --> 01:53:13.124
It's not for seven people as well,
exactly.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12779-0
01:53:13.804 --> 01:53:17.020
You could you could? Well,
it could be that you don't want it by

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12779-1
01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:20.730
default that the server goes out.
It sounds like you actually want to have

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12779-2
01:53:20.730 --> 01:53:23.797
some control of it,
and then so you could just manually go in

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12779-3
01:53:23.797 --> 01:53:26.964
service down before you close the
complaint or the next action.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12835-0
01:53:27.744 --> 01:53:30.517
Send customer satisfaction survey,
wait for those results.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12835-1
01:53:30.517 --> 01:53:34.325
They could be systemized they can fill it
in and then close complete and you can

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12835-2
01:53:34.325 --> 01:53:36.064
run the report. Yeah. Honestly, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12836-0
01:53:37.024 --> 01:53:37.544
You can show.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12837-0
01:53:37.864 --> 01:53:41.783
That on the dashboard, you know,
five star for this room and you can sort

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12837-1
01:53:41.783 --> 01:53:44.591
of say actually this room.
Why is it only getting 4?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12837-2
01:53:44.591 --> 01:53:47.504
What do we need it to do in facilities
that this room?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12861-0
01:53:47.974 --> 01:53:54.027
Is not performing it at that level,
so could that just that one room booking

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12841-0
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:51.030
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12861-1
01:53:54.027 --> 01:53:59.294
is starting to grow a picture of the
asset equality feedback, the?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12857-0
01:53:55.424 --> 01:53:55.824
Off.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12864-0
01:53:58.910 --> 01:54:02.637
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, the the other,
the other thing that comes into the mind</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12864-1
01:54:02.637 --> 01:54:06.185
<v Mark Sedge>is if you've got an outsource facilities
provision, right?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12864-2
01:54:06.185 --> 01:54:11.235
<v Mark Sedge>So it's a separate end company that runs
the building, owns the building, you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12864-3
01:54:11.235 --> 01:54:15.263
<v Mark Sedge>provides the facilities,
it enables you to get data to ensure that</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12864-4
01:54:15.263 --> 01:54:18.270
<v Mark Sedge>they're fulfilling their contractual
obligations.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12867-0
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:22.643
<v Mark Sedge>With quality of care, you know,
quality of the rooms and things like that.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12867-1
01:54:22.643 --> 01:54:25.677
<v Mark Sedge>So you know these things when you sort of
step back,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12867-2
01:54:25.677 --> 01:54:30.313
<v Mark Sedge>it goes from just being can we book some
stuff to actually how can we manage our</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12867-3
01:54:30.313 --> 01:54:34.664
<v Mark Sedge>you know our environment you know the the
office accommodation if you like,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12867-4
01:54:34.664 --> 01:54:37.870
<v Mark Sedge>how do we manage that and also manage the
you know the.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12870-0
01:54:38.150 --> 01:54:40.873
<v Mark Sedge>They will provide context to the
commercial teams,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12870-1
01:54:40.873 --> 01:54:44.612
<v Mark Sedge>the vendor management teams who are
managing that building provision.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12870-2
01:54:44.612 --> 01:54:47.389
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
because if you're consistently say having</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12870-3
01:54:47.389 --> 01:54:51.341
<v Mark Sedge>I know plug sockets fail and things
because they haven't particularly put</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12870-4
01:54:51.341 --> 01:54:54.545
<v Mark Sedge>decent ones on there,
you know USB sockets that fail really</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12870-5
01:54:54.545 --> 01:54:57.696
<v Mark Sedge>quickly. You know,
these are things you can go back to and</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12870-6
01:54:57.696 --> 01:54:57.910
<v Mark Sedge>say.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12873-0
01:54:57.990 --> 01:55:00.558
<v Mark Sedge>Actually,
we've seen a trend of feedback saying</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12873-1
01:55:00.558 --> 01:55:04.090
<v Mark Sedge>these things don't work.
You need to go and sort that out for us.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12873-2
01:55:04.090 --> 01:55:07.354
<v Mark Sedge>You need to swap them out over a holiday
period or whatever.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12873-3
01:55:07.354 --> 01:55:11.582
<v Mark Sedge>When the building's under use or whatever
we want you to swap out all of these</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12873-4
01:55:11.582 --> 01:55:15.542
<v Mark Sedge>because they're substandard for what
we're paying for or whatever you can</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12873-5
01:55:15.542 --> 01:55:17.790
<v Mark Sedge>provide that Intel that helps manage that.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12874-0
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:18.630
<v Mark Sedge>Special agreement.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12923-0
01:55:19.464 --> 01:55:22.837
Because it in reality you're in Glasgow
and the rooms are in London.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12923-1
01:55:22.837 --> 01:55:26.846
It's not like you can walk down and have
a look at them. So this is the insights.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12923-2
01:55:26.846 --> 01:55:29.730
You know that it just says, oh,
we're we're booking rooms,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12923-3
01:55:29.730 --> 01:55:33.544
but actually there's a whole load of
stuff that you need to make sure that it

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12923-4
01:55:33.544 --> 01:55:35.304
lands right for the client arriving.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12966-0
01:55:36.104 --> 01:55:39.671
So this workflow can take all that into
account that you're ahead of the curve.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12966-1
01:55:39.671 --> 01:55:41.855
You know that that room is,
you're not going to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12966-2
01:55:41.855 --> 01:55:44.798
It's not going to be noisy.
It's going to be no complaints on the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12966-3
01:55:44.798 --> 01:55:47.384
morning. It's seamless.
People can turn up, use the room,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12966-4
01:55:47.384 --> 01:55:50.104
reputation for the pie. You know,
for those client meetings.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/12979-0
01:55:51.184 --> 01:55:54.424
It's good to and they can actually don't
spend 10 minutes trying to fix a room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13025-0
01:55:55.064 --> 01:55:59.361
When money is clot, sticking,
it's all done up front and it plays into

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13025-1
01:55:59.361 --> 01:56:01.904
that narrative that it's right first time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13026-0
01:56:02.424 --> 01:56:06.781
Is this just for client booking names or
do you have what about for intern when I

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13026-1
01:56:06.781 --> 01:56:09.864
know we took that training but for
internal is that kind?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13027-0
01:56:09.864 --> 01:56:13.104
Of internal you can only services
provided there's really.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13020-0
01:56:09.874 --> 01:56:10.154
And.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13028-0
01:56:13.384 --> 01:56:14.544
Well, it's got the floor.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13050-0
01:56:15.504 --> 01:56:19.638
Because I said so,
we can treat yourself for like 4-4. Yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13050-1
01:56:19.638 --> 01:56:23.704
but first, second and 5th.
Essentially all they can get is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13053-0
01:56:25.044 --> 01:56:25.844
OK. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13095-0
01:56:27.294 --> 01:56:32.734
OK. Yeah. Most of all, that mate. Well,
like what room has?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13096-0
01:56:33.214 --> 01:56:34.974
Yes, we can track.
We can put that into that, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13097-0
01:56:34.974 --> 01:56:38.899
It will be the type of room we categorise
it. Client training,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13097-1
01:56:38.899 --> 01:56:43.946
you know third and the others and then
the equipment that's available to each of

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13097-2
01:56:43.946 --> 01:56:44.694
those rooms.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13115-0
01:56:45.504 --> 01:56:50.108
And the capacity that's available,
so that can all be systemized upfront and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13115-1
01:56:50.108 --> 01:56:51.424
captured soon Toronto.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13151-0
01:56:51.124 --> 01:56:52.764
I'll put it all in to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13152-0
01:56:53.604 --> 01:56:56.966
The teams. Yeah. Perfect. OK.
The room at the end,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13124-0
01:56:55.384 --> 01:56:55.864
Pretty quick.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13152-1
01:56:56.966 --> 01:57:01.844
each room still needs to have the same
regular tidy equipments, you know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13143-0
01:56:59.404 --> 01:57:00.884
You can think, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13144-0
01:57:01.444 --> 01:57:02.924
Yeah, that's yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13153-0
01:57:02.084 --> 01:57:03.044
Still work with that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13154-0
01:57:04.484 --> 01:57:05.884
All good. Talk to the 10 minute break.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13192-0
01:57:06.674 --> 01:57:09.641
Yeah,
they maybe I would just touch upon two

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13192-1
01:57:09.641 --> 01:57:13.664
things to manage room bookings.
So that one trivialise it is

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13192-2
01:57:13.664 --> 01:57:17.290
cancellations. OK,
I think we have touched on external

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13192-3
01:57:17.290 --> 01:57:21.313
because they are tightly,
they're just landlords and not and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13192-4
01:57:21.313 --> 01:57:22.434
Norfolk it's not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13222-0
01:57:23.624 --> 01:57:26.447
They're they're having a meeting with
something completely different.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13222-1
01:57:26.447 --> 01:57:28.584
It's the landlords. I don't know how many.
What the?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13223-0
01:57:29.184 --> 01:57:30.984
Volumes of those are,
I don't actually know and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13224-0
01:57:30.984 --> 01:57:34.584
Do they get? Do they,
do they Trump everybody? No, no,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13224-1
01:57:34.584 --> 01:57:35.304
not at all.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13235-0
01:57:36.444 --> 01:57:38.284
So the owner of the building I'm talking
about.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13254-0
01:57:39.264 --> 01:57:41.224
You should get yeah. OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13255-0
01:57:41.664 --> 01:57:47.758
Previously we would use the rooms well
anyway, because the other landlord,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13255-1
01:57:47.758 --> 01:57:49.384
but now they charge.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13276-0
01:57:50.524 --> 01:57:55.164
The landlords want the building. Sorry,
this is the first we've.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13262-0
01:57:51.544 --> 01:57:52.864
Yeah. Yeah, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13269-0
01:57:55.184 --> 01:57:55.744
They get charged.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13277-0
01:57:56.324 --> 01:57:57.644
Never had that we've said this.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13291-0
01:57:57.304 --> 01:57:59.917
Well, it probably be it.
Like if you went somebody else,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13292-0
01:57:59.384 --> 01:58:02.104
But you know what?
But we we still reheat them as.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13291-1
01:57:59.917 --> 01:58:01.064
somebody they still have.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13296-0
01:58:03.244 --> 01:58:03.564
Good.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13305-0
01:58:03.664 --> 01:58:04.704
So yeah, we we don't even have to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13306-0
01:58:05.024 --> 01:58:05.504
We don't even.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13307-0
01:58:05.504 --> 01:58:06.144
Have to like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13362-0
01:58:07.464 --> 01:58:11.608
OK, so you treat them like and.
Do you put them in particular rooms,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13314-0
01:58:08.944 --> 01:58:09.104
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13362-1
01:58:11.608 --> 01:58:16.293
but internal clients can trump the
landlords. Essentially, if there is there,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13362-2
01:58:16.293 --> 01:58:21.098
the only ones that the hierarchy is the
client can see the ones that are things

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13362-3
01:58:21.098 --> 01:58:24.642
that you treat the external though,
like a client looking.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13365-0
01:58:24.614 --> 01:58:25.894
Yes. Yes, just.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13362-4
01:58:24.642 --> 01:58:26.624
So I'm just thinking I just have.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13366-0
01:58:26.134 --> 01:58:27.294
That one, just that one.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13388-0
01:58:28.024 --> 01:58:29.864
WeChat thing like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13389-0
01:58:30.064 --> 01:58:32.526
So they can't.
But what I'm saying is partner can't

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13389-1
01:58:32.526 --> 01:58:34.184
remove them if they, you know they.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13406-0
01:58:34.574 --> 01:58:36.134
Well, we have the example just last week.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13397-0
01:58:36.464 --> 01:58:38.144
For a partner because he wants to build.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13407-0
01:58:37.854 --> 01:58:39.894
OK, so the partner can Trump.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13409-0
01:58:40.474 --> 01:58:41.114
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13422-0
01:58:43.504 --> 01:58:47.824
So they they paid for any person see,
as long as we move them to another person.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13432-0
01:58:48.124 --> 01:58:51.844
Definitely. OK, OK, right. Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13452-0
01:58:50.424 --> 01:58:51.264
Negotiation is a lot.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13453-0
01:58:52.104 --> 01:58:55.704
OK. All right. OK. All right.
And then we'll just touch upon.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13454-0
01:58:56.224 --> 01:58:56.744
What time do we?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13455-0
01:58:56.744 --> 01:58:57.544
Come back, come.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13456-0
01:58:57.544 --> 01:58:58.504
Back at quarter past.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13457-0
01:58:58.504 --> 01:59:01.024
So we touch upon cancellation, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13461-0
01:59:02.054 --> 01:59:03.694
Sorry, I was noise.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13479-0
01:59:04.614 --> 01:59:05.294
Even.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13473-0
01:59:08.144 --> 01:59:11.384
Over 40. Yeah,
that was always potential fee advice.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13480-0
01:59:11.334 --> 01:59:14.214
For this is for client and training the
others.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13488-0
01:59:20.074 --> 01:59:27.674
You can cancel in the morning, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13491-0
01:59:28.854 --> 01:59:30.934
As long as we yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13498-0
01:59:44.884 --> 01:59:45.924
So the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13509-0
01:59:47.914 --> 01:59:52.674
OK, cool. So we yeah,
counsellors so literally no approval.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13512-0
01:59:54.344 --> 01:59:56.184
I'll get over.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13514-0
01:59:55.944 --> 01:59:57.744
We get charged.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13540-0
01:59:57.704 --> 02:00:00.344
It can be just moved from the system.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13523-0
01:59:59.824 --> 02:00:00.864
Yeah. And then.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13541-0
02:00:00.864 --> 02:00:04.244
Approval for the meeting rooms is not
approval,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13541-1
02:00:04.244 --> 02:00:09.104
it's just ensuring that your codes and
the catering within 48 hours.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13552-0
02:00:13.214 --> 02:00:16.374
Yeah, sorry if it's translations on the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13553-0
02:00:16.374 --> 02:00:18.094
OK, yeah, I've seen that. Mm-hmm.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13558-0
02:00:19.404 --> 02:00:21.164
I've been on that for a long time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13564-0
02:00:21.854 --> 02:00:23.374
Think he's gone because he had a break?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13565-0
02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:25.630
<v Mark Sedge>This spot.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13566-0
02:00:27.150 --> 02:00:28.910
<v Mark Sedge>Back a quarter past Josh, yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13568-0
02:00:29.164 --> 02:00:29.604
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13569-0
02:00:30.350 --> 02:00:31.830
<v Mark Sedge>OK mate, cheers.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13571-0
02:00:32.624 --> 02:00:33.504
That's Josh.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13785-0
02:12:33.854 --> 02:12:36.413
I'm excited.
Like for all of the asking's to to get on

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13785-1
02:12:36.413 --> 02:12:40.089
to him and we obviously know the issues
that you're having. We share, realise.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13785-2
02:12:40.089 --> 02:12:42.136
Hopefully that won't be, you know,
forever.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13785-3
02:12:42.136 --> 02:12:45.486
Hopefully when the updated version gets
released, whenever that may be,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13785-4
02:12:45.486 --> 02:12:48.464
you'll be back to the way it was kind of
wasn't perfect either,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13785-5
02:12:48.464 --> 02:12:49.814
but obviously right now it's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13791-0
02:12:50.834 --> 02:12:51.354
A real pain.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13795-0
02:12:51.984 --> 02:12:54.344
I just. I just want an old mailbox.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13807-0
02:12:58.974 --> 02:13:00.854
To yeah, that would be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13808-0
02:13:00.754 --> 02:13:02.434
I'll need such a bit.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13857-0
02:13:03.784 --> 02:13:03.984
No.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13858-0
02:13:05.304 --> 02:13:09.807
So we have an upgrade a few weeks ago and
it's basically got a bug in it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13858-1
02:13:09.807 --> 02:13:13.824
We are dashboards aren't refreshed,
so they're basically showing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13859-0
02:13:13.824 --> 02:13:16.645
A zero.
So the only work around right now is

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13859-1
02:13:16.645 --> 02:13:19.466
either constantly refreshing or logging
out.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13859-2
02:13:19.466 --> 02:13:22.224
Then in the team are trying to connect
you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13860-0
02:13:22.224 --> 02:13:22.784
For some reason.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13861-0
02:13:22.784 --> 02:13:24.624
Nothing's working,
so you've got individual.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13867-0
02:13:24.954 --> 02:13:27.074
Set up right now to be able to view
what's coming in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13891-0
02:13:28.634 --> 02:13:31.923
So we're basically waiting on advantage,
releasing a new version,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13891-1
02:13:31.923 --> 02:13:34.914
and we'll need to upgrade again.
But obviously when we are.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13905-0
02:13:33.984 --> 02:13:34.864
We solve the problem.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13906-0
02:13:34.984 --> 02:13:38.332
We created last time over so that will be
the last one until end of life,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13906-1
02:13:38.332 --> 02:13:40.504
but we've got no choice other to upgrade
again.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13916-0
02:13:40.714 --> 02:13:44.074
It's the patch. The patcher.
I don't know how long does that take?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13915-0
02:13:41.994 --> 02:13:42.674
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13951-0
02:13:45.634 --> 02:13:49.472
For we upgraded. When did we upgrade?
September, September time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13934-0
02:13:49.294 --> 02:13:50.374
So I would actually.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13951-1
02:13:49.472 --> 02:13:54.019
We've been told imminent by Avanti,
but we're told imminent like 3 weeks ago

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13951-2
02:13:54.019 --> 02:13:54.314
they.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13952-0
02:13:54.314 --> 02:13:57.314
Say that's the same rule there. It's fine.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13953-0
02:13:57.674 --> 02:13:59.194
I'm not sure, I don't know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13981-0
02:14:00.714 --> 02:14:04.228
So I think it was released.
The bug was released two days before we

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13965-0
02:14:03.014 --> 02:14:03.374
Visually.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13981-1
02:14:04.228 --> 02:14:05.314
done the update, but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13982-0
02:14:06.034 --> 02:14:06.794
I don't know if anyone.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13983-0
02:14:06.794 --> 02:14:10.314
Saw it until afterwards,
and then it's obviously been reported.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13984-0
02:14:10.594 --> 02:14:10.834
And.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13990-0
02:14:11.704 --> 02:14:14.744
When it comes to Monday.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/13996-0
02:14:18.754 --> 02:14:21.314
Right now we have outgoing to fall back
on.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14020-0
02:14:23.154 --> 02:14:23.834
Which isn't ideal we.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14021-0
02:14:23.834 --> 02:14:24.954
Don't want people losing that, but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14022-0
02:14:24.954 --> 02:14:28.534
It's way right now when their dashboards
are showing zero and actually they've got

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14022-1
02:14:28.534 --> 02:14:29.354
like 20-30 tickets.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14023-0
02:14:29.354 --> 02:14:30.234
That we should be seeing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14027-0
02:14:31.134 --> 02:14:31.774
So later.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14033-0
02:14:40.150 --> 02:14:43.505
<v Mark Sedge>I am. Yeah, go ahead. I can't.
Can't see the room, though.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14033-1
02:14:43.505 --> 02:14:47.430
<v Mark Sedge>I don't know whether they. Josh,
you need to connect something, but.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14032-0
02:14:46.024 --> 02:14:46.184
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14045-0
02:14:47.994 --> 02:14:51.870
Our democracy, as you mentioned,
would you be able to come along to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14039-0
02:14:48.024 --> 02:14:48.704
I love you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14045-1
02:14:51.870 --> 02:14:52.554
extensively.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14046-0
02:14:52.670 --> 02:14:53.830
<v Mark Sedge>That's perfect. Thank you.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14053-0
02:14:54.534 --> 02:14:56.854
Basically why you can go on teams.
It's up to you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14056-0
02:15:00.974 --> 02:15:03.534
Just know, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14067-0
02:15:05.774 --> 02:15:08.974
It's just because the line is already
placing. It's not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14100-0
02:15:08.724 --> 02:15:09.404
Games, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14101-0
02:15:09.684 --> 02:15:13.877
But actually she caught me up this year
and before I was coming down and she

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14101-1
02:15:13.877 --> 02:15:14.204
asked.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14102-0
02:15:14.204 --> 02:15:17.445
About relation to you about the expected
one tomorrow, so to say.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14102-1
02:15:17.445 --> 02:15:21.324
Don't worry too much if you can't make it
face to face, you shouldn't come on.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14104-0
02:15:24.594 --> 02:15:24.754
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14119-0
02:15:24.604 --> 02:15:24.884
None.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14123-0
02:15:27.274 --> 02:15:30.917
I know we talked about that we might
we've done cancellation there.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14123-1
02:15:30.917 --> 02:15:33.114
I know that we also sort of talked about.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14137-0
02:15:34.674 --> 02:15:36.772
That we might be able to move on to other
ones,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14137-1
02:15:36.772 --> 02:15:38.434
but I also from my notes saw that you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14172-0
02:15:40.674 --> 02:15:45.883
We've talked about council moving the
room and so so there's that scenario.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14172-1
02:15:45.883 --> 02:15:48.967
If you think about, OK,
the 448 hour notice,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14172-2
02:15:48.967 --> 02:15:53.834
I want to be able to move is that tends
to come out that they've then.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14173-0
02:15:54.434 --> 02:15:54.834
Want to?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14192-0
02:15:55.774 --> 02:15:59.150
Upsize. Downsize. Not.
We've talked about departments and out

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14192-1
02:15:59.150 --> 02:16:02.854
trumping that we hopefully address some
of that with the check for.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14205-0
02:16:04.654 --> 02:16:06.216
What situation comes about from the
moving?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14205-1
02:16:06.216 --> 02:16:07.494
Is it because capacity is increased?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14210-0
02:16:09.294 --> 02:16:10.494
Capacity's decreased.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14233-0
02:16:10.604 --> 02:16:19.213
So it could be that time is more suit.
So sometimes if we book the six person

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14233-1
02:16:19.213 --> 02:16:22.524
room, there's only two people.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14239-0
02:16:23.394 --> 02:16:24.474
Attending we've just moved.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14262-0
02:16:25.644 --> 02:16:28.602
Oh yes.
So you could look and how do you get to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14262-1
02:16:28.602 --> 02:16:33.164
be informed that there's only two people
attending because the attendees?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14274-0
02:16:34.834 --> 02:16:36.514
So let's say I'm a karoon.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14275-0
02:16:36.554 --> 02:16:37.714
But I I know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14284-0
02:16:40.934 --> 02:16:44.294
There's gonna be roughly 12 people.
I don't put all 12 people's names.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14295-0
02:16:45.484 --> 02:16:48.164
You can just overwrite that and then I
have to go and have a call.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14298-0
02:16:46.974 --> 02:16:54.734
Yeah, of course. Yeah, of course.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14311-0
02:16:55.184 --> 02:17:00.851
And then so again,
then this model again to pin them on how

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14311-1
02:17:00.851 --> 02:17:03.024
long does it the major?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14328-0
02:17:04.634 --> 02:17:09.184
And this is where the 40 hour check.
Let's get through it. Yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14328-1
02:17:09.184 --> 02:17:13.314
and then we'll be done to. OK,
we'll register. OK, we can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14356-0
02:17:15.434 --> 02:17:16.994
Because we don't want to prevent people.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14357-0
02:17:17.114 --> 02:17:20.200
Even though they put those names out of
funds,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14339-0
02:17:17.264 --> 02:17:17.984
But and yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14357-1
02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:25.585
when do you get informed that that's less
people attended retrospectively in that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14364-0
02:17:25.514 --> 02:17:28.314
So what we do, we tend not to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14357-2
02:17:25.585 --> 02:17:25.914
room?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14368-0
02:17:27.914 --> 02:17:30.234
Is that the check box? Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14400-0
02:17:28.554 --> 02:17:34.547
One bit right, so can I just I'll.
I'll just show you this is easier.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14376-0
02:17:31.564 --> 02:17:31.804
Tissue.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14400-1
02:17:34.547 --> 02:17:40.626
Changes are highlighted by a column.
So M and I is column coordinated.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14400-2
02:17:40.626 --> 02:17:44.394
OK so the process being is 24 hours
before.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14412-0
02:17:46.114 --> 02:17:50.234
The meeting. Yeah, we've written notes.
I think everybody has changed.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14428-0
02:17:51.914 --> 02:17:53.998
So again,
there could be a number of reasons why

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14428-1
02:17:53.998 --> 02:17:56.593
they're a machine.
We don't have to worry that we don't have

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14429-0
02:17:55.954 --> 02:17:56.114
What?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14430-0
02:17:56.314 --> 02:17:56.954
Would look.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14428-2
02:17:56.593 --> 02:17:57.274
details on that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14461-0
02:17:57.864 --> 02:18:02.955
Protests to everyone that was mentioned
on the attendee list or who needs to be,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14461-1
02:18:02.955 --> 02:18:04.464
or all the requests are.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14462-0
02:18:04.864 --> 02:18:08.784
It's just, it's just I wish that. Yeah,
yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14467-0
02:18:08.664 --> 02:18:10.184
Yep, and it should be like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14468-0
02:18:10.184 --> 02:18:10.584
Around.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14514-0
02:18:12.134 --> 02:18:16.185
25 and you tell them why.
So it could be that you triggered it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14514-1
02:18:16.185 --> 02:18:17.894
Yeah, the change. Yeah. OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14483-0
02:18:17.494 --> 02:18:18.254
But do you?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14515-0
02:18:18.254 --> 02:18:19.774
Think and that it's quite a.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14516-0
02:18:19.774 --> 02:18:23.934
Few rooms on the 4th of or third floor.
Do you manually check every day each?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14496-0
02:18:20.794 --> 02:18:21.274
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14507-0
02:18:24.074 --> 02:18:25.554
No one wants someone. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14517-0
02:18:24.374 --> 02:18:24.814
For the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14518-0
02:18:24.814 --> 02:18:27.369
Following day to be like,
is this suitable? Yes. No,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14518-1
02:18:27.369 --> 02:18:28.334
move the room or is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14519-0
02:18:28.414 --> 02:18:28.574
It.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14534-0
02:18:29.474 --> 02:18:32.085
What we what we tend to do is when we
book the room,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14534-1
02:18:32.085 --> 02:18:34.154
we obviously book the appropriate sectrum.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14535-0
02:18:34.744 --> 02:18:35.464
Yeah, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14556-0
02:18:36.314 --> 02:18:39.297
Entertained to see can can we access
rooms?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14556-1
02:18:39.297 --> 02:18:44.314
So by the room template the forms that we
use, the appropriate size room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14554-0
02:18:42.994 --> 02:18:43.194
Yep.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14577-0
02:18:45.834 --> 02:18:50.898
Circumstances have changed depending on
the things have changed,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14577-1
02:18:50.898 --> 02:18:56.274
so the people has decreased increased,
but we'll move things around.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14610-0
02:18:57.634 --> 02:19:02.594
The reason that we do move a lot about is
we book a lot of all day means yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14611-0
02:19:03.034 --> 02:19:03.434
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14612-0
02:19:03.434 --> 02:19:09.171
Again, or just say it downs,
we'll get 15 minutes to say up six hours.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14612-1
02:19:09.171 --> 02:19:11.434
So that's again taking into.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14627-0
02:19:12.874 --> 02:19:16.238
Show you what it looks like.
So this is like I'm not a busy date.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14627-1
02:19:16.238 --> 02:19:18.074
So the rooms are colour coordinated.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14623-0
02:19:16.374 --> 02:19:16.574
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14661-0
02:19:18.374 --> 02:19:20.880
Mark,
we're just looking at a spreadsheet for

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14661-1
02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:22.134
the for Trimble or the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14641-0
02:19:22.190 --> 02:19:23.790
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, figured figured that.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14662-0
02:19:22.414 --> 02:19:23.334
Sort, yeah, but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14663-0
02:19:23.974 --> 02:19:24.654
They don't change.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14664-0
02:19:24.654 --> 02:19:28.094
Process kicks in for my team 24 hours
before and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14654-0
02:19:27.954 --> 02:19:28.874
OK, OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14665-0
02:19:29.734 --> 02:19:30.974
It says what? So that's why.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14686-0
02:19:33.234 --> 02:19:37.519
Your triggered. So it was that.
How do you get informed that less people

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14686-1
02:19:37.519 --> 02:19:38.634
are attending it's?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14687-0
02:19:39.154 --> 02:19:40.834
Not it's not just about the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14729-0
02:19:41.194 --> 02:19:44.799
So maybe it's a client consult saying
they've got like internal training and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14729-1
02:19:44.799 --> 02:19:48.218
they're one of the larger rooms.
We know we can add additional chairs or

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14704-0
02:19:47.914 --> 02:19:48.634
Right. OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14729-2
02:19:48.218 --> 02:19:51.683
like we move into a smaller room,
add the chairs and put client and their

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14729-3
02:19:51.683 --> 02:19:52.994
size room. That makes sense.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14718-0
02:19:53.034 --> 02:19:53.314
Are they?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14730-0
02:19:53.314 --> 02:19:56.354
Just using the only four or like yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14763-0
02:19:56.354 --> 02:20:00.400
And that's orange can tell us it's
because we're not checking every single

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14763-1
02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:02.719
one.
That's so the team has moved that and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14743-0
02:20:00.764 --> 02:20:01.164
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14763-2
02:20:02.719 --> 02:20:06.388
they've changed to 1 inches.
So that's what allowed the room change

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14763-3
02:20:06.388 --> 02:20:08.114
process to begin. OK, 124 hours.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14796-0
02:20:08.224 --> 02:20:12.618
OK, great. So Catering's already in place.
So it just means the catering won't get

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14796-1
02:20:12.618 --> 02:20:16.431
informed automatically from service now
that you know don't go to that,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14776-0
02:20:13.750 --> 02:20:13.870
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14783-0
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:16.030
<v Mark Sedge>Thank you.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14796-2
02:20:16.431 --> 02:20:19.184
you're now going to this room and that's
the power.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14805-0
02:20:18.244 --> 02:20:24.004
So that's just my schedule task. Yeah.
So we've got template.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14794-0
02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:19.910
<v Mark Sedge>Downstairs now.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14804-0
02:20:22.804 --> 02:20:23.244
Essentially.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14806-0
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:27.270
<v Mark Sedge>Go on your bed. You don't go out.
They get on your bed.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14811-0
02:20:27.514 --> 02:20:28.554
24 hours before.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14812-0
02:20:28.634 --> 02:20:29.714
Mark, can you hear us?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14813-0
02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:36.477
<v Mark Sedge>Sorry about that.
I was just having to manage my dog</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14824-0
02:20:36.434 --> 02:20:42.114
I thought it was a hit because I could
hear get on the bed.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14813-1
02:20:36.477 --> 02:20:38.190
<v Mark Sedge>because he was being a pain in the bum.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14830-0
02:20:45.390 --> 02:20:51.193
<v Mark Sedge>I was be be be reassured. Be reassured.
I wasn't talking about my wife.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14830-1
02:20:51.193 --> 02:20:57.158
<v Mark Sedge>She's in the office today. Sorry,
I got distracted and I had to just sort</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14827-0
02:20:53.624 --> 02:20:53.864
Rachel.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14830-2
02:20:57.158 --> 02:21:01.350
<v Mark Sedge>out my mutt from being a pest. Right.
Sorry, recap.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14834-0
02:20:59.904 --> 02:21:02.904
I we we gathered so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14833-0
02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:03.790
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14865-0
02:21:05.584 --> 02:21:09.064
Correct me if I'm wrong.
You go through the timber.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14866-0
02:21:10.144 --> 02:21:13.144
Actually it's actually called.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14867-0
02:21:13.544 --> 02:21:16.704
Yeah, it was pop bar.
I thought it strumble is there's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14853-0
02:21:15.344 --> 02:21:16.224
Why is it?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14870-0
02:21:16.994 --> 02:21:19.034
Whenever I go overseas in my life.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14885-0
02:21:20.064 --> 02:21:22.464
I saw Trimble 3 E as well. There was some.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14886-0
02:21:22.584 --> 02:21:26.104
That's for the hospitality report.
That's another schedule task.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14932-0
02:21:24.944 --> 02:21:29.572
Right, OK, OK. So 24 hours.
Room change notifications can be done so

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14932-1
02:21:29.572 --> 02:21:32.858
the requested could be notified from the
system.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14896-0
02:21:30.444 --> 02:21:30.764
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14932-2
02:21:32.858 --> 02:21:38.023
That can happen and catering also get
informed at the same time that change.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14912-0
02:21:36.214 --> 02:21:36.454
Hello.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14932-3
02:21:38.023 --> 02:21:43.455
It's not a surprise that they turned up
that they find out that they've actually

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14932-4
02:21:43.455 --> 02:21:44.864
moved to a different.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14978-0
02:21:46.104 --> 02:21:49.771
And and Mark,
you'll probably talk to this a bit better,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14978-1
02:21:49.771 --> 02:21:54.339
I'll just than me that the ServiceNow can
also mark that availability.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14978-2
02:21:54.339 --> 02:21:58.199
You know it can rather use managing a
separate spreadsheet.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14978-3
02:21:58.199 --> 02:22:01.094
The fact that that room is active,
inactive,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14978-4
02:22:01.094 --> 02:22:04.504
it has a status as well associated with
it could be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14981-0
02:22:04.110 --> 02:22:08.000
<v Mark Sedge>Yes, yes. Yeah.
So if you're looking at a list for you,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14981-1
02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:12.169
<v Mark Sedge>if you were looking at a list of view of
all of your rooms,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14981-2
02:22:12.169 --> 02:22:16.338
<v Mark Sedge>you'd be able to have one where they're
occupied, you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14981-3
02:22:16.338 --> 02:22:20.716
<v Mark Sedge>free type status or things like that
against or you could see.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14981-4
02:22:20.716 --> 02:22:22.870
<v Mark Sedge>The other thing I've seen done.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14984-0
02:22:23.070 --> 02:22:27.126
<v Mark Sedge>Where you have it like on a scheduled
view. So you literally just have,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14984-1
02:22:27.126 --> 02:22:30.845
<v Mark Sedge>you know it's colour blocks when it's
occupied and when it isn't.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14984-2
02:22:30.845 --> 02:22:33.550
<v Mark Sedge>There's a number of ways that we can show
them.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/14997-0
02:22:34.484 --> 02:22:39.804
You can see the spreadsheet does exactly
what it is like. OK, that's good.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15009-0
02:22:40.144 --> 02:22:42.024
And this is automatic this machine.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15010-0
02:22:42.424 --> 02:22:45.544
No. So it's that sheet. So it's a, it's a,
it's an actual.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15015-0
02:22:45.824 --> 02:22:46.264
It's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15016-0
02:22:46.464 --> 02:22:47.984
Actually system so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15039-0
02:22:49.864 --> 02:22:52.961
You need to actually know this,
because I'm getting up here.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15039-1
02:22:52.961 --> 02:22:56.768
So this is like an old W so there's a
more that could be coming. But yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15039-2
02:22:56.768 --> 02:22:57.784
it's just basically.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15066-0
02:22:59.564 --> 02:23:01.793
And do you like using it?
I mean pain points,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15066-1
02:23:01.793 --> 02:23:05.574
I mean if you were to do translate that
into service now if there's something

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15066-2
02:23:05.574 --> 02:23:07.804
that you go actually that's difficult
moving.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15065-0
02:23:05.894 --> 02:23:06.894
I guess just because.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15071-0
02:23:09.344 --> 02:23:10.304
User using yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15082-0
02:23:11.024 --> 02:23:12.864
It's like second nature, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15083-0
02:23:13.944 --> 02:23:17.024
OK, OK, so that works. So there's no pain.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15084-0
02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:20.777
<v Mark Sedge>So what? So what we need to we're sorry,
just because obviously I,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15084-1
02:23:20.777 --> 02:23:24.194
<v Mark Sedge>you know psychic.
I was able to see what that looked like</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15084-2
02:23:24.194 --> 02:23:27.140
<v Mark Sedge>through the back of the screen through
the walls.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15084-3
02:23:27.140 --> 02:23:31.676
<v Mark Sedge>The thing is what what we would do is
we'd look at those requirements and we</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15084-4
02:23:31.676 --> 02:23:32.030
<v Mark Sedge>would.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15087-0
02:23:32.310 --> 02:23:36.832
<v Mark Sedge>Get something to emulate the same sort of
look and feel for you.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15087-1
02:23:36.832 --> 02:23:42.190
<v Mark Sedge>Driven out of what was, you know,
what's being recorded requested, etcetera.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15128-0
02:23:41.934 --> 02:23:46.827
Yeah, but the fact is that you go into,
you're moving a room in service now it's

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15128-1
02:23:46.827 --> 02:23:49.848
been 422.
You're moving into four and just saying

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15128-2
02:23:49.848 --> 02:23:53.715
423. And that's done. We move,
swap it around. You can do that,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15128-3
02:23:53.715 --> 02:23:56.494
can you can see that it's active or
inactive.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15154-0
02:23:57.544 --> 02:24:01.753
You won't be able to select the room if
it's already at you know if it's not

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15154-1
02:24:01.753 --> 02:24:04.923
available and cature would get told at
the same time. So,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15154-2
02:24:04.923 --> 02:24:07.984
and if there's additional things that
that room needed.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15173-0
02:24:09.584 --> 02:24:13.255
For laptops or whatever,
all of that's built into those,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15173-1
02:24:13.255 --> 02:24:16.862
those triggers,
everyone that needs to know at the same

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15173-2
02:24:16.862 --> 02:24:17.184
time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15208-0
02:24:17.854 --> 02:24:21.218
They get to know, so that.
Did you hear that? Oh, no. I wasn't told.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15208-1
02:24:21.218 --> 02:24:23.606
You know,
everyone who needs to be informed is a

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15208-2
02:24:23.606 --> 02:24:25.654
one stop messaging. And can you set times?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15209-0
02:24:25.654 --> 02:24:26.734
When people get told.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15210-0
02:24:26.894 --> 02:24:29.254
That information,
rather than just like everything.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15255-0
02:24:30.944 --> 02:24:31.624
5 or 6.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15256-0
02:24:31.624 --> 02:24:32.784
Times. So it's not like every time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15257-0
02:24:32.784 --> 02:24:33.384
We're moving, it's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15258-0
02:24:33.384 --> 02:24:35.678
All.
So what you're saying is that if you're

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15258-1
02:24:35.678 --> 02:24:38.736
juggling on this,
that you're moving and you think, oh, no,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15258-2
02:24:38.736 --> 02:24:42.712
actually, I'm going to move it back.
It could be that that's a close complete

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15258-3
02:24:42.712 --> 02:24:45.159
that is approved, as it were.
So at the moment,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15258-4
02:24:45.159 --> 02:24:47.504
you're sort of in draft mode, yes,
moving it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15306-0
02:24:47.984 --> 02:24:52.703
And you're trying to work it out. OK,
if I do that and then you could be so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15306-1
02:24:52.703 --> 02:24:56.258
So you're in that process.
Your move process, as it were.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15306-2
02:24:56.258 --> 02:25:00.793
And then once you've worked it out,
you could just press approve and then

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15306-3
02:25:00.793 --> 02:25:05.084
they get notified rather than,
as you say that you get that calendar,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15306-4
02:25:05.084 --> 02:25:06.984
you get your notification says.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15312-0
02:25:07.824 --> 02:25:09.664
422423426.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15326-0
02:25:11.384 --> 02:25:14.579
Meeting room and everyone.
You can hear the noise coming up your

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15326-1
02:25:14.579 --> 02:25:15.464
rules. So is that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15327-0
02:25:15.464 --> 02:25:16.104
What you mean?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15368-0
02:25:16.894 --> 02:25:20.865
Something to remove it so we only send
our changes like the day before so we

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15368-1
02:25:20.865 --> 02:25:23.393
wouldn't send them like every single one
change.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15368-2
02:25:23.393 --> 02:25:27.055
So if we have to go and approve it every
single time, you'll get that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15368-3
02:25:27.055 --> 02:25:28.654
Maybe can you move such things?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15369-0
02:25:28.654 --> 02:25:31.174
And on certain things,
so do you want to send it 24 hours?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15383-0
02:25:31.984 --> 02:25:34.988
And is that sufficient notice for
everyone that's attending that meeting at

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15388-0
02:25:34.864 --> 02:25:36.704
It won't for Kate you for Kate and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15383-1
02:25:34.988 --> 02:25:35.304
say yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15428-0
02:25:39.304 --> 02:25:41.864
24 hours.
See you could just approve it then. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15428-1
02:25:41.864 --> 02:25:45.753
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You do it that way.
So you're now in this room and catering.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15428-2
02:25:45.753 --> 02:25:48.264
You're now in this room. Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
that's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15429-0
02:25:48.264 --> 02:25:48.784
Possible. OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15430-0
02:25:48.984 --> 02:25:51.299
You can move as you said,
it might be a lead time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15430-1
02:25:51.299 --> 02:25:54.704
I mean we're we're sort of talking about
scenarios where there's 72 hours.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15464-0
02:25:54.874 --> 02:25:58.271
Know on on this week you're talking about
it could be a lead.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15464-1
02:25:58.271 --> 02:26:01.176
What was we're talking about now 4 weekly,
Don't we?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15464-2
02:26:01.176 --> 02:26:05.341
But the rules are that you can't book too
much in advance unless as of your

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15464-3
02:26:05.341 --> 02:26:07.314
approval. But as you said, it could.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15465-0
02:26:07.354 --> 02:26:07.834
Move.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15466-0
02:26:08.234 --> 02:26:09.034
So many times.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15495-0
02:26:09.824 --> 02:26:14.054
But that notification of where you are,
where you're going and what you're doing

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15495-1
02:26:14.054 --> 02:26:17.344
could be 24 hours before. OK,
that's good to make sense, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15513-0
02:26:18.354 --> 02:26:19.914
Please send notifications.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15514-0
02:26:19.954 --> 02:26:20.474
For.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15515-0
02:26:21.074 --> 02:26:24.664
The 24 hour only when you move rooms do
you ever send out a confirmation.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15515-1
02:26:24.664 --> 02:26:26.314
You're absolutely in this room 25.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15563-0
02:26:27.984 --> 02:26:30.707
As well.
So we've saved them our version and then

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15563-1
02:26:30.707 --> 02:26:33.104
reception, that's all.
Reception's not bad.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15564-0
02:26:33.504 --> 02:26:35.304
And why would reception move it?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15565-0
02:26:35.304 --> 02:26:39.728
Could just be a case or someone's not
showed up and then client wants an issue

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15565-1
02:26:39.728 --> 02:26:42.024
room, so they'll move them just a client.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15566-0
02:26:42.024 --> 02:26:43.904
Will actually say I want to find
something.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15575-0
02:26:43.784 --> 02:26:45.664
OK, so say for instance moving there.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15577-0
02:26:45.424 --> 02:26:46.304
Oh, that movement.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15576-0
02:26:45.664 --> 02:26:45.864
1.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15627-0
02:26:47.544 --> 02:26:50.088
Came available so I was not showed up,
so then moved on enter,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15627-1
02:26:50.088 --> 02:26:51.744
things like that or like people can shop.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15628-0
02:26:52.184 --> 02:26:56.144
And that's why a reception into it,
to use the same. Yeah, I've just seen.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15629-0
02:26:56.464 --> 02:26:59.224
With you? Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense for.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15630-0
02:26:59.224 --> 02:27:02.872
The similar workflows and then they
effectively they're still moving, yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15630-1
02:27:02.872 --> 02:27:04.264
it's still the move workflow.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15639-0
02:27:05.464 --> 02:27:05.984
That they're.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15661-0
02:27:05.514 --> 02:27:08.721
They send information on that.
So like that or like some things like

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15649-0
02:27:08.264 --> 02:27:08.944
That's sort of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15661-1
02:27:08.721 --> 02:27:10.813
that.
So they'll do their own check and then

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15661-2
02:27:10.813 --> 02:27:13.834
they'll send that information on the same
thing that would tell.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15676-0
02:27:13.474 --> 02:27:15.740
Well,
if they if they're in there and they do

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15676-1
02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:17.810
that,
then you'll get a notification that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15676-2
02:27:17.810 --> 02:27:20.274
they've added that on the same day
process, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15677-0
02:27:20.634 --> 02:27:21.034
That's good.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15706-0
02:27:22.904 --> 02:27:29.346
The last one I wanted to cover for
managing bookings had offsite as well as

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15706-1
02:27:29.346 --> 02:27:30.024
on site.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15707-0
02:27:30.144 --> 02:27:34.308
Yeah,
so off site is essentially the external

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15707-1
02:27:34.308 --> 02:27:35.304
non client.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15725-0
02:27:35.774 --> 02:27:39.719
Oh, OK yeah, that's what that means. OK,
great. Even though they're on site.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15711-0
02:27:36.984 --> 02:27:37.144
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15724-0
02:27:39.664 --> 02:27:40.024
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15725-1
02:27:39.719 --> 02:27:41.974
So they're external.
We call them off site.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15730-0
02:27:43.304 --> 02:27:45.184
What? What previously?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15733-0
02:27:45.664 --> 02:27:45.824
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15761-0
02:27:47.104 --> 02:27:52.413
We'll see JP Morgan.
So JP Morgan is a client or transparent.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15761-1
02:27:52.413 --> 02:27:58.664
So previously the JP Morgan PE,
which just e-mail us and say can I have?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15786-0
02:28:00.784 --> 02:28:04.476
I'm the that's my client.
I'm the client of John Smith,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15786-1
02:28:04.476 --> 02:28:09.486
so we might book the room that way.
But we we have to get a stop because we

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15786-2
02:28:09.486 --> 02:28:11.464
need is approved like they so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15803-0
02:28:12.294 --> 02:28:14.254
We have to come through our trust.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15804-0
02:28:14.854 --> 02:28:15.534
So it comes to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15805-0
02:28:15.734 --> 02:28:19.654
The P. OK, so OK yeah, Alexa.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15809-0
02:28:22.624 --> 02:28:24.424
OK, that's good.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15813-0
02:28:24.364 --> 02:28:24.684
That's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15829-0
02:28:26.704 --> 02:28:30.360
Do you mind for one minute just talking
about the landlord?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15829-1
02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:31.944
Because that's completely.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15830-0
02:28:31.944 --> 02:28:33.744
What, what the terms of?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15865-0
02:28:35.504 --> 02:28:39.400
How do they use it? Why do they use it?
It's just says I've ever heard,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15865-1
02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:42.323
like an landlord that you rent a building
personally.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15855-0
02:28:41.534 --> 02:28:42.654
I do at tomorrow.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15865-2
02:28:42.323 --> 02:28:46.544
Even if I experience even other laws,
they're like it's ours. We paid friend.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15870-0
02:28:45.644 --> 02:28:47.644
So and I think.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15871-0
02:28:48.204 --> 02:28:50.124
It came down to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15876-0
02:28:52.224 --> 02:28:53.344
Sorry, I do think you can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15885-0
02:28:55.344 --> 02:28:58.224
Because previously Black Bridge were able
to use.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15893-0
02:29:00.024 --> 02:29:03.944
Or lunch, etcetera.
And somewhere down the line.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15916-0
02:29:05.784 --> 02:29:10.885
They made the decision to charge them,
OK and that's relatively new.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15916-1
02:29:10.885 --> 02:29:16.504
It's really cool because it was,
it was new size, it sounds like, yeah, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15951-0
02:29:18.294 --> 02:29:24.951
The meetings are called Blackledge.
So essentially they are kind of this year.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15951-1
02:29:24.951 --> 02:29:30.934
They are first and I don't actually know
that the actual relationship.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15944-0
02:29:29.634 --> 02:29:31.314
That's an.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15952-0
02:29:31.814 --> 02:29:33.574
What priority do they have in the packing?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15960-0
02:29:34.034 --> 02:29:35.114
They would just come through.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15993-0
02:29:35.344 --> 02:29:36.224
They can I look into.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15994-0
02:29:36.264 --> 02:29:41.048
That week so we can accommodate them. No,
actually, they would put that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15981-0
02:29:40.824 --> 02:29:42.184
They were the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15994-1
02:29:41.048 --> 02:29:44.784
So we can't accommodate them.
We can't accommodate them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/15995-0
02:29:44.944 --> 02:29:46.984
That's that's OK.
That's what they have to do.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16002-0
02:29:45.624 --> 02:29:48.864
Access to catering?
Do they see it as their building?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16005-0
02:29:49.514 --> 02:29:49.594
No.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16006-0
02:29:49.594 --> 02:29:50.674
No, it's translating traffic.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16021-0
02:29:50.784 --> 02:29:55.304
Access exactly we through the Porsche and
they have the charge codes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16057-0
02:29:52.824 --> 02:29:53.824
You have said OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16058-0
02:29:55.384 --> 02:29:58.185
Yes.
So they have essentially they are

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16058-1
02:29:58.185 --> 02:30:02.424
separate keeping their separate quotes
because they get a.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16043-0
02:30:01.924 --> 02:30:03.724
Hi again that's also.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16059-0
02:30:02.424 --> 02:30:02.864
Voice.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16060-0
02:30:03.424 --> 02:30:07.444
OK. Because and the request can't come in.
I mean, they're not on ServiceNow.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16060-1
02:30:07.444 --> 02:30:08.784
So you would just have to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16072-0
02:30:10.344 --> 02:30:11.544
No. So we.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16073-0
02:30:11.544 --> 02:30:14.664
Yeah,
we need to put them down as operations.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16085-0
02:30:16.264 --> 02:30:19.888
As the host,
but because we are the Black educator

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16085-1
02:30:19.888 --> 02:30:22.304
hospitality node to differentiate.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16096-0
02:30:23.854 --> 02:30:25.734
So you get the request today through an.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16097-0
02:30:25.734 --> 02:30:26.774
E-mail yes, OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16131-0
02:30:27.444 --> 02:30:31.644
Which you could then go into ServiceNow
and populate as if you know you could

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16131-1
02:30:31.644 --> 02:30:35.630
create it as a task yourself so that
you're following the same structure.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16119-0
02:30:33.824 --> 02:30:34.024
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16131-2
02:30:35.630 --> 02:30:38.484
So the and then you're then they're in
the workflow.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16148-0
02:30:39.384 --> 02:30:41.140
So they need to be moved.
They're the original,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16148-1
02:30:41.140 --> 02:30:43.664
but they're getting for, you know,
all of that. So you would create.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16149-0
02:30:43.664 --> 02:30:44.104
That.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16158-0
02:30:45.864 --> 02:30:46.664
Visibility on the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16161-0
02:30:46.944 --> 02:30:49.144
On the dashboard for you, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16174-0
02:30:50.664 --> 02:30:53.024
Employees. So this is in this book in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16169-0
02:30:50.904 --> 02:30:51.504
Exactly.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16173-0
02:30:53.104 --> 02:30:53.264
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16222-0
02:30:55.064 --> 02:30:59.783
The charge all that details that you need.
So you would you would almost become the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16222-1
02:30:59.783 --> 02:31:03.604
requester on their behalf.
It's tracked within that service now and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16201-0
02:31:02.324 --> 02:31:04.564
Yes, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16222-2
02:31:03.604 --> 02:31:07.649
you would have that full disability and
it would go into the workflows,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16222-3
02:31:07.649 --> 02:31:10.571
active rooms.
You know you just formed part of that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16222-4
02:31:10.571 --> 02:31:12.144
portfolio, it's not managed.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16235-0
02:31:13.224 --> 02:31:16.127
Outside of the system,
you would incorporate them within the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16235-1
02:31:16.127 --> 02:31:18.506
system,
but you would be populating it on half of

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16231-0
02:31:17.430 --> 02:31:17.790
<v Mark Sedge>So.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16235-2
02:31:18.506 --> 02:31:18.744
them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16238-0
02:31:19.710 --> 02:31:23.926
<v Mark Sedge>So one of the things we'd need to be
mindful of is that identifying those so</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16238-1
02:31:23.926 --> 02:31:26.335
<v Mark Sedge>that when you're looking at your
reporting,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16238-2
02:31:26.335 --> 02:31:30.606
<v Mark Sedge>you'd exclude those if you like from your
normal sort of reporting structure.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16238-3
02:31:30.606 --> 02:31:33.289
<v Mark Sedge>If they're,
if they're treated separately or you</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16238-4
02:31:33.289 --> 02:31:36.519
<v Mark Sedge>might include them,
but you at least want to highlight who</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16238-5
02:31:36.519 --> 02:31:38.710
<v Mark Sedge>they are. So are they, are they sort of?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16242-0
02:31:40.390 --> 02:31:44.631
<v Mark Sedge>It's like one only one or two contacts
that connect with you to yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16242-1
02:31:44.631 --> 02:31:47.539
<v Mark Sedge>So what you could do is you could have a
named.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16241-0
02:31:45.694 --> 02:31:45.854
None.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16242-2
02:31:47.539 --> 02:31:52.386
<v Mark Sedge>We could have those as named individuals
or named organisations in all you know</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16242-3
02:31:52.386 --> 02:31:57.476
<v Mark Sedge>amongst all or rather users they wouldn't
have any other user rights in the system.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16242-4
02:31:57.476 --> 02:31:58.870
<v Mark Sedge>But you could at least.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16247-0
02:31:58.950 --> 02:32:02.791
<v Mark Sedge>Select them as requested for because
you'd probably want to do things</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16247-1
02:32:02.791 --> 02:32:06.303
<v Mark Sedge>requested for anyway,
because somebody might come up to you and</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16247-2
02:32:06.303 --> 02:32:09.870
<v Mark Sedge>ask for help. You know directly,
without going into this system.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16247-3
02:32:09.870 --> 02:32:12.779
<v Mark Sedge>So you'd want to be able to request for
that person.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16247-4
02:32:12.779 --> 02:32:14.590
<v Mark Sedge>I would have thought potentially.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16293-0
02:32:13.624 --> 02:32:18.488
Yeah, I think forgive me if I'm wrong.
Marcus on the process diagrams.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16293-1
02:32:18.488 --> 02:32:22.393
They're called external bookings,
isn't that right? Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16293-2
02:32:22.393 --> 02:32:27.121
And everything else is internal.
So when Asha is already categorised

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16276-0
02:32:25.390 --> 02:32:27.430
<v Mark Sedge>So you classify them as an external.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16293-3
02:32:27.121 --> 02:32:32.054
behind the scenes as internal,
but when you do it for the Black bridge.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16293-4
02:32:32.054 --> 02:32:33.904
So yes, that you will call.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16306-0
02:32:34.474 --> 02:32:37.633
Externals. Yes. So Mark,
there's always that differentiation in

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16306-1
02:32:37.633 --> 02:32:39.114
the process today in terms of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16307-0
02:32:38.710 --> 02:32:40.989
<v Mark Sedge>OK, OK.
But I'm just thinking if you've got</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16307-1
02:32:40.989 --> 02:32:44.668
<v Mark Sedge>mandatory fields in the form,
you would if you've got those in a table</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16307-2
02:32:44.668 --> 02:32:48.606
<v Mark Sedge>so that you can at least select them,
it doesn't mean that you have to have</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16307-3
02:32:48.606 --> 02:32:52.077
<v Mark Sedge>more complex rules to rule out when it's
mandatory, when it's not,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16307-4
02:32:52.077 --> 02:32:55.549
<v Mark Sedge>you can just select them.
So it might be just something we look at</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16307-5
02:32:55.549 --> 02:32:56.430
<v Mark Sedge>especially there.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16309-0
02:32:56.670 --> 02:32:59.150
<v Mark Sedge>Common known individuals that book it.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16312-0
02:33:00.064 --> 02:33:00.664
OK. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16313-0
02:33:01.070 --> 02:33:02.230
<v Mark Sedge>Something to think about anyway.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16331-0
02:33:02.904 --> 02:33:05.424
No, we can manage it the same because.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16332-0
02:33:06.384 --> 02:33:11.129
Then you've got the four transfers,
particularly if you've got, I said,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16332-1
02:33:11.129 --> 02:33:15.544
catering, moving rooms, you know,
notifications, shuffling around.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16339-0
02:33:17.204 --> 02:33:19.604
OK, that's quite good Nanjing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16349-0
02:33:19.154 --> 02:33:22.314
This just flipping points,
come on there is that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16350-0
02:33:21.884 --> 02:33:22.244
That's it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16355-0
02:33:24.644 --> 02:33:25.324
The sleeping boards.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16386-0
02:33:26.214 --> 02:33:27.574
Anything here, honestly.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16387-0
02:33:27.694 --> 02:33:32.075
That's asked approval task,
so depending on who they are, why need?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16387-1
02:33:32.075 --> 02:33:36.972
Why need that absolutely come through to
either me or Siobhan to it through

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16387-2
02:33:36.972 --> 02:33:41.161
external? No, no internal.
It's all internal staff to choose the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16387-3
02:33:41.161 --> 02:33:41.934
same points.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16404-0
02:33:42.744 --> 02:33:46.584
I wasn't sure about the separate.
Practically. If that was in this.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16414-0
02:33:43.134 --> 02:33:47.554
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. What's actually? Yeah.
Yes. There's a speaking Part 1 as well.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16414-1
02:33:47.554 --> 02:33:50.774
So that's managed in the same way.
Do you treat them as a?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16434-0
02:33:51.624 --> 02:33:55.601
Only Intel staff can use a sleeping
points, so it's easily import.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16422-0
02:33:53.904 --> 02:33:54.184
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16434-1
02:33:55.601 --> 02:33:57.264
It's basically a hotel room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16435-0
02:33:58.184 --> 02:33:58.664
What is it?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16436-0
02:33:58.664 --> 02:33:59.424
Yeah, it's not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16441-0
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:06.555
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, I've used.
I've used one of the I did some work</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16441-1
02:34:06.555 --> 02:34:10.784
<v Mark Sedge>years ago on an outsource with Clifford
Chance and I had to use one of their</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16441-2
02:34:10.784 --> 02:34:13.311
<v Mark Sedge>little.
It's like a little little mini little</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16441-3
02:34:13.311 --> 02:34:17.320
<v Mark Sedge>hotel room where you can get your head
down when you're working late and</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16441-4
02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:17.870
<v Mark Sedge>overnight.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16443-0
02:34:18.494 --> 02:34:18.534
I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16458-0
02:34:21.284 --> 02:34:27.364
I thought they were like you could go and
catnap for like, 15 minutes in the day.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16455-0
02:34:21.404 --> 02:34:25.284
'M not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16477-0
02:34:29.064 --> 02:34:29.544
But used to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16465-0
02:34:29.284 --> 02:34:29.644
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16478-0
02:34:29.544 --> 02:34:33.904
Yes, but again, it's costing money.
It's cosmetic. The cleaners in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16507-0
02:34:34.524 --> 02:34:39.128
Turn them around. So these are,
so the rules on that is beyond 6:00 PM to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16485-0
02:34:36.824 --> 02:34:37.304
1000.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16507-1
02:34:39.128 --> 02:34:44.284
So there are some rules around that that
they actually can't be booked in the days.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16492-0
02:34:40.374 --> 02:34:40.694
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16495-0
02:34:41.470 --> 02:34:41.750
<v Mark Sedge>Eric.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16519-0
02:34:44.314 --> 02:34:45.714
And is this what to be?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16520-0
02:34:46.434 --> 02:34:48.114
Three hours only, OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16518-0
02:34:46.484 --> 02:34:46.644
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16551-0
02:34:48.884 --> 02:34:52.326
Sometimes over like that. Sorry.
Sometimes like the partner can sort of

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16551-1
02:34:52.326 --> 02:34:55.147
override it. So like, for instance,
when she was pregnant?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16551-2
02:34:55.147 --> 02:34:57.825
It's obviously she thought that because
she didn't see,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16551-3
02:34:57.825 --> 02:34:59.164
she could see anywhere else.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16555-0
02:34:59.874 --> 02:35:02.394
There could be some rules set such as you
need.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16552-0
02:35:01.750 --> 02:35:02.070
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16559-0
02:35:03.204 --> 02:35:04.764
So she wanted I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16560-0
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:09.450
<v Mark Sedge>And is there only one approval required
or is it because again when I go back to</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16560-1
02:35:09.450 --> 02:35:12.899
<v Mark Sedge>my own experience,
I had to get like 3 approvals because the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16560-2
02:35:12.899 --> 02:35:16.235
<v Mark Sedge>nature of what it,
what it was and to your point about the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16560-3
02:35:16.235 --> 02:35:19.572
<v Mark Sedge>commitment to have,
you know bedding sorted and other bits</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16560-4
02:35:19.572 --> 02:35:20.590
<v Mark Sedge>and bobs in there.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16562-0
02:35:21.390 --> 02:35:22.670
<v Mark Sedge>Is it multi approval?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16582-0
02:35:23.224 --> 02:35:27.624
So I would say you probably can extend it
to Samantha,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16582-1
02:35:27.624 --> 02:35:30.984
so she's the operations senior operations.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16586-0
02:35:31.134 --> 02:35:32.214
Oh, it's not there. Yeah, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16613-0
02:35:32.304 --> 02:35:37.603
So I came to everybody approval,
but again, I just like the circumstances,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16613-1
02:35:37.603 --> 02:35:42.831
but again it's that it's down to common
sense as well. So she's pregnant,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16613-2
02:35:42.831 --> 02:35:45.304
obviously. Yeah. That should folks.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16653-0
02:35:44.604 --> 02:35:44.964
So this.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16654-0
02:35:45.204 --> 02:35:47.244
Is like they're working on like a a late.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16655-0
02:35:47.244 --> 02:35:47.844
Deal. Yes or?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16656-0
02:35:47.844 --> 02:35:48.724
Something. Yeah. And then.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16629-0
02:35:47.924 --> 02:35:48.124
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16657-0
02:35:48.724 --> 02:35:51.894
It can. OK. Yeah. So yeah.
So you could so tell me what?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16657-1
02:35:51.894 --> 02:35:54.897
So how do they get triggered if we go
back to spaces,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16657-2
02:35:54.897 --> 02:35:56.844
how do you get the request you get?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16658-0
02:35:56.964 --> 02:35:57.924
Yeah. So just.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16670-0
02:35:59.544 --> 02:36:03.030
So it's usually the VL themselves,
so they're probably so depending on who's

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16670-1
02:36:03.030 --> 02:36:03.664
on each child.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16682-0
02:36:03.674 --> 02:36:06.874
Up to five o'clock 6:00 that they want to
attend. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16678-0
02:36:06.224 --> 02:36:07.384
You know exactly.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16683-0
02:36:12.190 --> 02:36:14.510
<v Mark Sedge>These are these again, sorry.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16712-0
02:36:20.804 --> 02:36:22.524
So we're here till 9:00 PM.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16713-0
02:36:23.244 --> 02:36:25.084
So how does that work, if somebody?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16714-0
02:36:25.524 --> 02:36:29.004
Emailed at half nine,
you'd have logged off, but they've sent.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16715-0
02:36:29.164 --> 02:36:29.844
It to admin at.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16716-0
02:36:29.844 --> 02:36:30.604
Ushers.com.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16724-0
02:36:32.384 --> 02:36:33.744
It's usually people who.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16766-0
02:36:37.044 --> 02:36:41.195
But that could be beyond,
so you'd have a working up, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16766-1
02:36:41.195 --> 02:36:45.022
behind the scenes,
this is your matrix out of office hours

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16766-2
02:36:45.022 --> 02:36:49.044
at 9 when you cut off,
then the assignment group then becomes

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16766-3
02:36:49.044 --> 02:36:52.417
security.
You have access to be and then they would

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16766-4
02:36:52.417 --> 02:36:53.844
get that notification.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16797-0
02:36:54.804 --> 02:36:58.263
That you know,
so they're presumably in the building and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16767-0
02:36:55.390 --> 02:36:55.590
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16797-1
02:36:58.263 --> 02:37:01.237
then they would manage that access to
that part.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16777-0
02:36:58.274 --> 02:36:59.114
Yes, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16797-2
02:37:01.237 --> 02:37:05.850
So there could be rules that be online.
It goes the assignment before is to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16797-3
02:37:05.850 --> 02:37:08.764
yourself after is and that's auto
assigned, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16803-0
02:37:09.204 --> 02:37:10.804
When the Fiona goes on.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16812-0
02:37:12.804 --> 02:37:15.444
Or on the key on behalf of the Fiona of
the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16843-0
02:37:17.524 --> 02:37:20.465
But that could be performed and then it
gets triggered and they can book it

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16843-1
02:37:20.465 --> 02:37:21.084
accordingly. So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16844-0
02:37:21.684 --> 02:37:24.805
Are cleaners advised?
If someone that's a sleeping pod so that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16844-1
02:37:24.805 --> 02:37:26.044
they can go in after the?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16863-0
02:37:26.604 --> 02:37:30.586
Just look at the report.
So I'm thinking I don't know for sure,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16863-1
02:37:30.586 --> 02:37:35.004
right. So again, I'm sorry.
I'm just showing my screen again. So what?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16861-0
02:37:34.350 --> 02:37:34.870
<v Mark Sedge>That's right.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16887-0
02:37:35.604 --> 02:37:38.804
Services. That's like a live dashboard,
yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16872-0
02:37:38.974 --> 02:37:39.494
Alright.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16888-0
02:37:39.404 --> 02:37:45.307
So let me just go to service provider and
I don't know if the cleaners use this

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16888-1
02:37:45.307 --> 02:37:47.004
right. See the service.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16898-0
02:37:48.824 --> 02:37:51.544
But they could do we can have dashboards
for those, all those available.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16899-0
02:37:54.790 --> 02:37:54.910
<v Mark Sedge>It.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16914-0
02:37:56.944 --> 02:38:02.024
To see like there's a service required,
so I don't know if we just downloaded.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16958-0
02:38:03.944 --> 02:38:09.304
And see? Or is IT security?
It would say look, they've just left that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16931-0
02:38:09.244 --> 02:38:09.924
But yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16959-0
02:38:09.904 --> 02:38:14.196
But in terms of so when so they go on
trigger point they enter it, they want,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16959-1
02:38:14.196 --> 02:38:18.708
they want the sleeping part of they're in
the buildings are they are they they're

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16960-0
02:38:18.394 --> 02:38:18.954
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16959-2
02:38:18.708 --> 02:38:19.424
in this, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16995-0
02:38:21.074 --> 02:38:23.954
And then security get notification that
person.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16996-0
02:38:23.954 --> 02:38:24.274
'S got I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16997-0
02:38:24.274 --> 02:38:25.234
Don't know how.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16998-0
02:38:25.234 --> 02:38:27.954
Many are available. They've got room 1024.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16999-0
02:38:27.954 --> 02:38:30.303
Yeah, but yeah,
because actually I forgot we need to let

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/16999-1
02:38:30.303 --> 02:38:30.674
security.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17000-0
02:38:30.674 --> 02:38:31.954
Know. Yes. So that's the main.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17002-0
02:38:31.974 --> 02:38:33.454
They need to change their past, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17042-0
02:38:33.514 --> 02:38:37.584
Into that room.
So that's a notification and then it's

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17042-1
02:38:37.584 --> 02:38:43.209
assumed I'm assuming it's ready to go.
What I mean is catering the thing we

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17022-0
02:38:42.404 --> 02:38:42.804
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17042-2
02:38:43.209 --> 02:38:49.130
don't need to go in and get the room
ready, not it's cleaning is done on exits.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17042-3
02:38:49.130 --> 02:38:50.314
So each room is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17051-0
02:38:51.224 --> 02:38:52.224
State of Active Ready for use.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17052-0
02:38:52.224 --> 02:38:53.304
Yes, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17053-0
02:38:53.304 --> 02:38:54.344
It certainly can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17054-0
02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:58.310
<v Mark Sedge>And if these are treated as assets,
you'd have a state. Sorry, just.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17058-0
02:38:59.214 --> 02:39:01.374
Yes, like an asset state.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17061-0
02:39:00.310 --> 02:39:02.332
<v Mark Sedge>So.
So what I was saying is you'd have a</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17061-1
02:39:02.332 --> 02:39:05.194
<v Mark Sedge>state, because if someone's just exited,
say for example,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17061-2
02:39:05.194 --> 02:39:09.140
<v Mark Sedge>it's it's early hours or the cleaners,
I haven't been able to refresh the room,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17061-3
02:39:09.140 --> 02:39:12.495
<v Mark Sedge>then it will be in, you know,
in clean or whatever the whatever the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17061-4
02:39:12.495 --> 02:39:14.666
<v Mark Sedge>status is.
And therefore that wouldn't come</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17061-5
02:39:14.666 --> 02:39:16.590
<v Mark Sedge>available until they've completed that.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17065-0
02:39:17.150 --> 02:39:21.112
<v Mark Sedge>And then you'd need.
Then you'd need the mechanism for them to</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17064-0
02:39:17.504 --> 02:39:18.704
Don't go up.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17065-1
02:39:21.112 --> 02:39:25.516
<v Mark Sedge>close, so part of your task,
and This is why all of these groups kind</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17065-2
02:39:25.516 --> 02:39:28.912
<v Mark Sedge>of need to be on,
because what you'd have is once the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17065-3
02:39:28.912 --> 02:39:32.750
<v Mark Sedge>occupancy had finished,
a task will go to the cleaning crew.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17068-0
02:39:33.070 --> 02:39:37.400
<v Mark Sedge>They would then close their task and then
it would switch it back,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17068-1
02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:41.149
<v Mark Sedge>ready to go again.
You see what I'm saying so you can use</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17068-2
02:39:41.149 --> 02:39:44.510
<v Mark Sedge>the task to drive the the status of the
of the pod.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17086-0
02:39:45.184 --> 02:39:47.137
Yeah.
And these rooms are quite good to manage

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17086-1
02:39:47.137 --> 02:39:48.384
in the sense that once you're.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17087-0
02:39:48.384 --> 02:39:48.504
In.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17088-0
02:39:48.504 --> 02:39:51.064
It halfway through the night,
no one's going to move you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17113-0
02:39:52.684 --> 02:39:56.364
'Re almost one the business was one
person. One room. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17114-0
02:39:56.604 --> 02:39:58.644
All that length, the period, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17145-0
02:39:57.714 --> 02:40:02.066
For that length of periods between 6:00
PM and what you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17145-1
02:40:02.066 --> 02:40:07.682
and it's only one occupancy per night.
So it's not like if you left at 5:00 AM,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17145-2
02:40:07.682 --> 02:40:11.754
you're waiting for another person to come
in at 5:15, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17185-0
02:40:12.624 --> 02:40:17.209
That's probably quite a good opportunity
that cleaning ashwa could say these were

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17185-1
02:40:17.209 --> 02:40:20.340
used overnight.
They get that they get the notification

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17185-2
02:40:20.340 --> 02:40:23.862
and they know how many rooms we use and
then turn them around,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17185-3
02:40:23.862 --> 02:40:28.224
so they're inactive until cleaning have
completed it to make it active again.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17193-0
02:40:28.774 --> 02:40:30.294
And that could be on the dashboard.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17195-0
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:34.270
<v Mark Sedge>And and again you remember when I was
talking about the management of your</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17195-1
02:40:34.270 --> 02:40:37.967
<v Mark Sedge>facilities provider,
turning those rooms around within service</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17195-2
02:40:37.967 --> 02:40:41.018
<v Mark Sedge>level expect,
yeah expectation etcetera gives you a</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17195-3
02:40:41.018 --> 02:40:44.950
<v Mark Sedge>chance to it would be an advantage for
ashes to be able to have a.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17198-0
02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:49.683
<v Mark Sedge>Trigger point that says you know you've
got your task to go clean it here.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17198-1
02:40:49.683 --> 02:40:52.252
<v Mark Sedge>You know,
we expect it done within six hours or</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17198-2
02:40:52.252 --> 02:40:56.693
<v Mark Sedge>whatever it happens to be or three hours
or whatever the SLA is and then they will</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17198-3
02:40:56.693 --> 02:40:59.583
<v Mark Sedge>close the task.
And then that gives you metrics to be</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17198-4
02:40:59.583 --> 02:41:01.510
<v Mark Sedge>able to actually manage that supply.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17202-0
02:41:05.310 --> 02:41:08.040
<v Mark Sedge>This is where the overlap,
but this is my point.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17201-0
02:41:07.684 --> 02:41:13.404
Yeah, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17202-1
02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:12.276
<v Mark Sedge>This is where there's an overlap,
but your activity can be an advantage and</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17202-2
02:41:12.276 --> 02:41:15.230
<v Mark Sedge>help them as well as vice versa if that
makes sense.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17241-0
02:41:15.794 --> 02:41:18.227
Yeah.
So we've got and the service hours that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17241-1
02:41:18.227 --> 02:41:21.613
they're available are what 7 PMI don't?
When someone, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17241-2
02:41:21.613 --> 02:41:25.316
when they go to sleep because it were
8:00 PM till 8:00 AM, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17228-0
02:41:22.514 --> 02:41:22.794
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17241-3
02:41:25.316 --> 02:41:28.914
is that the window that they're allowed
to occupy them? Is there a.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17272-0
02:41:29.764 --> 02:41:32.604
So they're only allowed to work
essentially.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17273-0
02:41:32.884 --> 02:41:37.141
Yeah, but what's the over?
What if it is overnight hours?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17260-0
02:41:34.334 --> 02:41:34.934
If I was.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17273-1
02:41:37.141 --> 02:41:40.444
What exit hours? Exit. Exit hours? Yeah,
so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17274-0
02:41:40.764 --> 02:41:42.124
I'm looking at there's more.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17290-0
02:41:44.324 --> 02:41:47.404
Today we book anything like after work
there was like 10 in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17291-0
02:41:47.404 --> 02:41:47.524
The.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17292-0
02:41:47.524 --> 02:41:50.764
Morning. Yeah. OK, 10 in the morning. OK.
That's a good. OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17337-0
02:41:52.324 --> 02:41:55.702
And then I'm just thinking about.
So they've got their room,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17337-1
02:41:55.702 --> 02:41:58.638
they enter it and they just think, well,
the lights,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17337-2
02:41:58.638 --> 02:42:03.124
but are they presumably then they can
move if you go back to, do they ever move?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17338-0
02:42:03.244 --> 02:42:03.524
I think.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17328-0
02:42:03.414 --> 02:42:04.494
If it's not right.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17339-0
02:42:04.684 --> 02:42:06.044
So obvious security.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17340-0
02:42:06.044 --> 02:42:08.244
Know who's to note, so I don't know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17372-0
02:42:09.164 --> 02:42:11.000
Their process,
maybe they checked security to make sure

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17372-1
02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:11.164
that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17373-0
02:42:11.164 --> 02:42:14.832
It's anything. So maybe we check,
take that as a parking lot to make sure.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17373-1
02:42:14.832 --> 02:42:17.082
Well,
the room would be empty because as Mark

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17373-2
02:42:17.082 --> 02:42:20.164
said that we would have an asset of that,
you know the status.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17391-0
02:42:19.234 --> 02:42:22.983
I'm gonna look it up.
So that's one from last week is booked

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17391-1
02:42:22.983 --> 02:42:27.594
from uh midnight to is midnight the next
day. Do you know what I mean? So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17409-0
02:42:29.144 --> 02:42:30.784
It's because they're.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17410-0
02:42:30.784 --> 02:42:31.544
Having it for.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17411-0
02:42:31.544 --> 02:42:34.184
Multiple nights,
so usually if it's like 2 nights.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17444-0
02:42:40.124 --> 02:42:44.485
Yeah, yeah, OK.
So these halls can be the cleaning enemy

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17444-1
02:42:44.485 --> 02:42:50.147
gets they they cleaning only get the
notification to clean it on end date

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17444-2
02:42:50.147 --> 02:42:53.284
effective leave dates. Yeah, that's yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17439-0
02:42:51.070 --> 02:42:52.150
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17476-0
02:42:53.034 --> 02:42:56.571
Or as you see, they went down there.
They want to change everyday,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17476-1
02:42:56.571 --> 02:43:00.690
so they would probably need to know if
the room's been occupied at that time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17476-2
02:43:00.690 --> 02:43:04.703
So that's I think they're looking at
security parties to see that they are,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17512-0
02:43:04.404 --> 02:43:06.884
Yes. Mm-hmm. Yeah.
I've I've done that as a parking lot.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17476-3
02:43:04.703 --> 02:43:04.914
yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17492-0
02:43:07.084 --> 02:43:09.044
That's probably, you know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17513-0
02:43:07.724 --> 02:43:08.404
Been out.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17514-0
02:43:09.044 --> 02:43:13.809
Insecurity. Give it to them.
So if you're booking it for them up to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17514-1
02:43:13.809 --> 02:43:17.662
that same time,
do you manage those security passes or

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17514-2
02:43:17.662 --> 02:43:18.924
security still OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17519-0
02:43:19.434 --> 02:43:21.954
You just do the booking for them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17525-0
02:43:20.884 --> 02:43:21.044
Can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17526-0
02:43:22.804 --> 02:43:24.564
Anybody go straight out to security?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17531-0
02:43:25.724 --> 02:43:26.204
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17541-0
02:43:26.524 --> 02:43:29.961
But they will have to now that would
systemize it now that they have to go

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17541-1
02:43:29.961 --> 02:43:30.924
through this process.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17559-0
02:43:31.314 --> 02:43:35.339
Person's and security could complete it
on behalf of their standing there,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17559-1
02:43:35.339 --> 02:43:37.594
but it would still have to go through the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17572-0
02:43:38.724 --> 02:43:39.244
In.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17579-0
02:43:39.644 --> 02:43:41.724
444 rooms. Yeah, be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17580-0
02:43:42.524 --> 02:43:46.044
In London only or Glasgow have to look up,
OK. And Paris, what would I have?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17586-0
02:43:49.564 --> 02:43:50.644
So they've not moved them yet.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17587-0
02:43:49.594 --> 02:43:51.754
OK, that's OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17590-0
02:43:56.324 --> 02:43:56.484
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17609-0
02:43:57.724 --> 02:44:02.584
I don't have access to people book day
today like they input a date until a date

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17609-1
02:44:02.584 --> 02:44:03.964
or a time until a time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17628-0
02:44:03.164 --> 02:44:07.728
So you've got your app,
you're the best one, Fiona,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17628-1
02:44:07.728 --> 02:44:12.204
who always uses that.
So he's always staying late.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17633-0
02:44:13.484 --> 02:44:14.284
We get notifications.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17640-0
02:44:16.964 --> 02:44:17.844
How often in advance?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17642-0
02:44:18.014 --> 02:44:18.774
Maybe I'll be connect.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17648-0
02:44:20.244 --> 02:44:20.604
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17649-0
02:44:20.644 --> 02:44:21.804
Or is this not meant to like?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17658-0
02:44:23.364 --> 02:44:26.724
When it gets flagged so there was another
loss that may or was monitored.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17669-0
02:44:25.484 --> 02:44:29.804
We we send the portal. Sorry,
I send the link.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17675-0
02:44:32.404 --> 02:44:34.884
Al yeah, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17680-0
02:44:35.254 --> 02:44:36.574
She does for that report.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17681-0
02:44:37.254 --> 02:44:38.774
Yeah. OK. That's a good point.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17694-0
02:44:41.124 --> 02:44:46.004
Are they entitled to catering or doesn't?
OK, let me just get us. OK, that's fine.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17707-0
02:44:48.164 --> 02:44:53.689
OK, I think that that's managing rooms.
You've gone through categories,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17707-1
02:44:53.689 --> 02:44:54.764
sleeping pods.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17715-0
02:44:56.644 --> 02:44:59.444
And the cancellation process and the move
process.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17732-0
02:45:01.084 --> 02:45:01.924
Which I think it's let.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17733-0
02:45:01.924 --> 02:45:05.844
Me just check 24 hours activity,
48 hours activity,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17733-1
02:45:05.844 --> 02:45:07.804
notifications to catering.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17744-0
02:45:09.244 --> 02:45:13.884
Before reception and proving staff.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17752-0
02:45:16.524 --> 02:45:18.644
That's very good. That's quite a lot,
I think.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17753-0
02:45:19.724 --> 02:45:21.084
That's most of it done.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17756-0
02:45:22.844 --> 02:45:23.244
And then.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17788-0
02:45:25.584 --> 02:45:29.146
You might need to transfer or maybe in
the next topic to talk is managed

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17788-1
02:45:29.146 --> 02:45:31.830
transportation.
I think there was lots of processes on

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17788-2
02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:35.344
car parking, you know. So for example,
if they were coming car parking.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17826-0
02:45:36.884 --> 02:45:41.461
Motorbike parking there was that managing
that so is that incorporated as a

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17826-1
02:45:41.461 --> 02:45:46.159
separate service or do they tend to be
part of the fact that they've booked a

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17826-2
02:45:46.159 --> 02:45:48.929
room?
You're also checking that maybe they're

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17817-0
02:45:48.294 --> 02:45:48.574
They.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17826-3
02:45:48.929 --> 02:45:52.724
also booking a space to come into the
office to allocate that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17825-0
02:45:51.284 --> 02:45:52.684
You know it's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17848-0
02:45:54.004 --> 02:45:56.695
Right.
Usually there's two different types you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17848-1
02:45:56.695 --> 02:45:56.924
can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17849-0
02:45:57.524 --> 02:45:58.364
Reserve a space.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17850-0
02:45:58.364 --> 02:46:01.917
Like apparently is that because they're
coming to a meeting or it could be

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17850-1
02:46:01.917 --> 02:46:03.244
completely separate reasons?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17857-0
02:46:05.634 --> 02:46:09.034
London we use the car parking for clients
or?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17869-0
02:46:10.334 --> 02:46:10.574
For the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17862-0
02:46:10.564 --> 02:46:10.884
For the client.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17870-0
02:46:10.974 --> 02:46:12.974
Clients coming in OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17890-0
02:46:12.524 --> 02:46:13.284
Yeah. So maybe.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17891-0
02:46:13.364 --> 02:46:18.324
That's the same mountain in the space, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17885-0
02:46:19.384 --> 02:46:20.744
Sorry. How's counselling?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17892-0
02:46:19.604 --> 02:46:23.524
Partners can't book the space.
There is five spaces.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17908-0
02:46:25.484 --> 02:46:30.105
Yeah,
5 spaces in London 4 are bought by the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17908-1
02:46:30.105 --> 02:46:33.084
VMS and they are their space.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17916-0
02:46:33.654 --> 02:46:36.134
So we have one available space.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17912-0
02:46:35.284 --> 02:46:35.404
For.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17928-0
02:46:38.204 --> 02:46:44.084
For people who came to meet and or it's
the treatment.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17952-0
02:46:45.804 --> 02:46:51.893
So essentially we we don't really use
that space in London except outside, yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17952-1
02:46:51.893 --> 02:46:56.404
1 space and it's I say perhaps it's
always a safe practise.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17993-0
02:46:57.904 --> 02:47:00.817
OK,
so it comes into you currently as

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17993-1
02:47:00.817 --> 02:47:05.262
requesting to chair well and they will
give you the same.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17962-0
02:47:01.164 --> 02:47:02.004
Yes, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17993-2
02:47:05.262 --> 02:47:11.701
I mean so it's comes in as new I want it.
I'm driving in now my train I need to get

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/17993-3
02:47:11.701 --> 02:47:15.304
there. My train is cancelled.
I need probably.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18021-0
02:47:15.604 --> 02:47:16.324
Get.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18022-0
02:47:16.524 --> 02:47:21.964
That very early in London. Yeah. Glasgow.
Yes, that would be a scenario.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18023-0
02:47:22.524 --> 02:47:26.964
And you get that. That's yeah.
You would get that in London, you say you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18024-0
02:47:26.964 --> 02:47:28.804
Know in London, OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18025-0
02:47:28.804 --> 02:47:31.084
That's the question. Seriously,
it's a pre book.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18039-0
02:47:32.044 --> 02:47:34.964
Flights home? Yeah, 5 minutes ago.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18070-0
02:47:33.384 --> 02:47:34.384
And.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18071-0
02:47:35.584 --> 02:47:38.284
That's habit.
And is that just because they've always

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18071-1
02:47:38.284 --> 02:47:39.384
had a space available?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18072-0
02:47:39.384 --> 02:47:42.035
Do you know anglers go?
It was COVID times.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18072-1
02:47:42.035 --> 02:47:44.866
It changed the way we used car parking
spaces,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18072-2
02:47:44.866 --> 02:47:49.144
so previously the car park is basically
Glasgow, which is for clients.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18095-0
02:47:49.924 --> 02:47:55.325
Or people who had an appointment early
late appointment my new space.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18095-1
02:47:55.325 --> 02:48:00.958
But now that is a prevalent for anybody
to use the space species things.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18095-2
02:48:00.958 --> 02:48:01.884
That's cool.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18106-0
02:48:02.764 --> 02:48:03.244
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18103-0
02:48:03.634 --> 02:48:03.874
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18107-0
02:48:03.684 --> 02:48:05.804
Anybody can tell how many spaces in that
city?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18113-0
02:48:06.454 --> 02:48:10.654
Three. Yes, cucky right, so you suggest.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18126-0
02:48:09.884 --> 02:48:14.570
And they have to manage that.
So the way we have to manage that is put

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18126-1
02:48:14.570 --> 02:48:16.484
it in higher, higher, OK, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18148-0
02:48:17.214 --> 02:48:21.731
So what was it you turned up with a car.
If you were driving in expecting you said

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18148-1
02:48:21.731 --> 02:48:23.854
to go to the public if car park OK, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18150-0
02:48:22.054 --> 02:48:24.734
Yes. OK. Just me a favour and then?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18149-0
02:48:24.374 --> 02:48:24.694
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18182-0
02:48:26.844 --> 02:48:30.556
I mean, I've I don't know,
we've probably all done that is it,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18182-1
02:48:30.556 --> 02:48:34.917
but I always used to park here.
I mean you have to change your habits of,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18182-2
02:48:34.917 --> 02:48:38.453
OK, if I'm in a car,
I've got to arrange where I'm going to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18182-3
02:48:38.453 --> 02:48:40.044
leave my car when I arrive.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18186-0
02:48:40.944 --> 02:48:42.024
So it's that change.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18187-0
02:48:41.310 --> 02:48:42.390
<v Mark Sedge>Just a quick question.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18192-0
02:48:43.004 --> 02:48:44.724
In pre booking before you arrive.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18195-0
02:48:45.230 --> 02:48:49.448
<v Mark Sedge>Just quick question for the London one.
You said that it might be used for trades</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18195-1
02:48:49.448 --> 02:48:53.152
<v Mark Sedge>folks, you know the trades wouldn't.
Wouldn't that just be organised by</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18195-2
02:48:53.152 --> 02:48:56.341
<v Mark Sedge>facilities directly?
Because usually someone's going to be in</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18195-3
02:48:56.341 --> 02:48:59.479
<v Mark Sedge>because they're repairing something
therefore wouldn't that,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18194-0
02:48:59.054 --> 02:48:59.254
It.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18195-4
02:48:59.479 --> 02:49:03.595
<v Mark Sedge>wouldn't they just book that and lock it
out and just tell you it was taken for</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18195-5
02:49:03.595 --> 02:49:04.470
<v Mark Sedge>that day because?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18244-0
02:49:05.124 --> 02:49:07.004
Have access to the booking system but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18245-0
02:49:07.924 --> 02:49:11.910
Another great opportunity that facilities
you know and do they get.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18245-1
02:49:11.910 --> 02:49:15.487
So again we're back into that same
categorization. You know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18245-2
02:49:15.487 --> 02:49:19.649
it is a room effectively it's it's got
all the equipment, but it is a.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18245-3
02:49:19.649 --> 02:49:24.164
That's why I was thinking do we manage it
as a room but you are effectively.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18277-0
02:49:25.164 --> 02:49:27.932
A space? Yeah.
And like we just talked about.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18277-1
02:49:27.932 --> 02:49:32.083
Does it have a hierarchy? That OK.
It was planned for trades people.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18277-2
02:49:32.083 --> 02:49:34.791
They have to come in for one of the
reasons.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18277-3
02:49:34.791 --> 02:49:39.364
But then the client says I need it is
there's moving that you have to move.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18279-0
02:49:40.164 --> 02:49:40.484
Is there any?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18285-0
02:49:40.884 --> 02:49:42.364
Out trumping when it comes to those.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18294-0
02:49:44.484 --> 02:49:44.924
It's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18298-0
02:49:45.924 --> 02:49:48.964
Is it in here in London?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18295-0
02:49:46.484 --> 02:49:48.524
Very few volumes of people driving now.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18305-0
02:49:49.674 --> 02:49:50.594
Glasgow all the time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18317-0
02:49:51.134 --> 02:49:55.254
But London's you have all the public not
many people, because you've got all the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18309-0
02:49:53.710 --> 02:49:53.990
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18323-0
02:49:54.374 --> 02:49:59.174
So we would,
we would see if it's already there, those.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18354-0
02:50:02.324 --> 02:50:06.716
Recommend. Oh, OK yeah.
And does that get paid for because they

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18354-1
02:50:06.716 --> 02:50:12.550
think, well, I don't move for that space.
They just pay that they might expense. OK,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18354-2
02:50:12.550 --> 02:50:14.884
OK. So it's a very low volume and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18389-0
02:50:16.384 --> 02:50:19.622
OK.
But they it could still be if we look at

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18389-1
02:50:19.622 --> 02:50:25.450
standardising the process they request it
when they want it for who's it for and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18389-2
02:50:25.450 --> 02:50:29.984
tends to be the PE that requests that on
behalf of the person.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18393-0
02:50:31.014 --> 02:50:32.974
London you find this the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18410-0
02:50:34.844 --> 02:50:38.764
Directly,
so they can just book a simple request

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18398-0
02:50:35.204 --> 02:50:35.524
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18410-1
02:50:38.764 --> 02:50:41.484
for that item that I'm doing that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18438-0
02:50:39.354 --> 02:50:39.834
Yeah. Do you?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18439-0
02:50:41.394 --> 02:50:46.194
Need to know the time as well because see
for example someone wanted to get 9:00 to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18439-1
02:50:46.194 --> 02:50:48.594
2:00 then someone wanted it 3 till 5 like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18440-0
02:50:48.594 --> 02:50:50.714
That would be OK, wouldn't it?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18456-0
02:50:49.494 --> 02:50:51.508
You need. Yeah,
you need to make them aware of it if

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18456-1
02:50:51.508 --> 02:50:51.774
you're.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18457-0
02:50:51.774 --> 02:50:56.094
Becoming one after that,
something that's yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18479-0
02:50:54.954 --> 02:50:57.342
Yes,
but you can have it the same like with

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18452-0
02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:57.110
<v Mark Sedge>What?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18479-1
02:50:57.342 --> 02:50:59.892
the room. It's an active in out.
It's an exit.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18479-2
02:50:59.892 --> 02:51:04.017
You know it doesn't have to have any
catering or cleaning or they just pull

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18468-0
02:51:00.550 --> 02:51:00.670
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18480-0
02:51:03.750 --> 02:51:07.243
<v Mark Sedge>Do you?
Do you have the situation for disability</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18479-3
02:51:04.017 --> 02:51:04.234
out.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18480-1
02:51:07.243 --> 02:51:11.950
<v Mark Sedge>parking close to are these over and above
the disability parking?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18484-0
02:51:13.594 --> 02:51:14.434
Yes, I think yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18499-0
02:51:15.834 --> 02:51:15.954
Let.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18500-0
02:51:16.554 --> 02:51:18.194
Him know with that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18501-0
02:51:19.234 --> 02:51:19.874
But what was the?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18502-0
02:51:19.874 --> 02:51:21.714
Question he's sorry,
was there one in Glasgow?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18503-0
02:51:21.714 --> 02:51:23.154
And every single space.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18529-0
02:51:25.604 --> 02:51:30.611
And does that always have to be empty in
the event? So for example,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18513-0
02:51:29.990 --> 02:51:31.270
<v Mark Sedge>No, because what?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18529-1
02:51:30.611 --> 02:51:34.587
can it be used by a Fiona as well? If not,
yes, Mark,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18523-0
02:51:34.394 --> 02:51:34.874
Is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18529-2
02:51:34.587 --> 02:51:37.164
what was your particular sign into?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18530-0
02:51:36.750 --> 02:51:39.975
<v Mark Sedge>Well,
I was going to say sometimes through and</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18530-1
02:51:39.975 --> 02:51:45.055
<v Mark Sedge>it just depends on on your organisation.
But if you have, I've seen some,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18530-2
02:51:45.055 --> 02:51:49.447
<v Mark Sedge>I've been party to somebody,
my team who was wheelchair access,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18530-3
02:51:49.447 --> 02:51:54.870
<v Mark Sedge>who had permanent space in in that. Yeah.
So although it was disabled parking.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18533-0
02:51:55.270 --> 02:51:59.927
<v Mark Sedge>They to keep the disabled one free,
they allocated a permanent space of the.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18533-1
02:51:59.927 --> 02:52:04.524
<v Mark Sedge>So if we had five outside the main
building that I'm thinking and recalling</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18533-2
02:52:04.524 --> 02:52:09.303
<v Mark Sedge>one of those was a disabled one and the
other one was permanently allocated to</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18533-3
02:52:09.303 --> 02:52:12.146
<v Mark Sedge>this individual because they had access
needs.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18533-4
02:52:12.146 --> 02:52:15.110
<v Mark Sedge>Do you ever have that where something's
blocked?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18535-0
02:52:15.230 --> 02:52:18.873
<v Mark Sedge>Out or you just don't have that.
That player in your organisation,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18535-1
02:52:18.873 --> 02:52:20.070
<v Mark Sedge>so it hasn't occurred.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18557-0
02:52:20.844 --> 02:52:24.034
It's not within our team that was going
to be a scenario.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18557-1
02:52:24.034 --> 02:52:28.544
Obviously they would need to go ahead and
speak to operations so that patients we

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18555-0
02:52:27.174 --> 02:52:27.734
Cool. Yep.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18557-2
02:52:28.544 --> 02:52:28.764
are.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18578-0
02:52:30.154 --> 02:52:35.034
Assist for John's path because he's
disabled and he needs it for that, but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18579-0
02:52:35.354 --> 02:52:38.354
It could be, as you say,
that it's available.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18591-0
02:52:39.954 --> 02:52:42.754
So if we look at the status of that car
parking space, it was active.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18601-0
02:52:44.434 --> 02:52:48.354
And you can you can book it for your
disability. That's fine, but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18636-0
02:52:48.934 --> 02:52:54.374
If it needed to be blocked out for go to
operations, that's an approval process.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18623-0
02:52:54.134 --> 02:52:55.014
Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm just.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18637-0
02:52:54.614 --> 02:52:54.814
And it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18638-0
02:52:54.974 --> 02:53:01.555
Becomes UN inactive, so you can't book it.
But all other times it's active to be

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18638-1
02:53:01.555 --> 02:53:02.774
used for other.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18652-0
02:53:03.954 --> 02:53:07.787
Fee owners to park in if it's available.
That's probably the sort of process mark

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18652-1
02:53:07.787 --> 02:53:08.114
of the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18655-0
02:53:08.150 --> 02:53:10.323
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.
Now that makes sense because the other</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18655-1
02:53:10.323 --> 02:53:13.222
<v Mark Sedge>thing is, if they're,
if they are hybrid worker, obviously,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18655-2
02:53:13.222 --> 02:53:17.038
<v Mark Sedge>then you logically you'd still expect
them to tell you when they were going to</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18655-3
02:53:17.038 --> 02:53:19.550
<v Mark Sedge>be in. So it was available. Yeah,
no standard good.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18665-0
02:53:20.544 --> 02:53:21.784
We don't before 7.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18666-0
02:53:21.784 --> 02:53:23.224
We don't have that for our clients.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18678-0
02:53:23.884 --> 02:53:28.857
This one lady who needed the car space so
but she, but she would let us know. Yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18678-1
02:53:28.857 --> 02:53:29.804
she would be in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18724-0
02:53:31.784 --> 02:53:33.104
But no, apart from that, that's probably.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18725-0
02:53:33.104 --> 02:53:36.914
The one that was one and there could be
either it's a permanent roles,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18687-0
02:53:34.590 --> 02:53:34.990
<v Mark Sedge>OK.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18725-1
02:53:36.914 --> 02:53:41.153
they always we it's always going to be
used or they come in three days a week,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18725-2
02:53:41.153 --> 02:53:44.695
it's always going to be used.
So you've got the system to make it

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18725-3
02:53:44.695 --> 02:53:48.344
basically what it's saying is it's a
space, it becomes inactive or.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18742-0
02:53:49.664 --> 02:53:51.989
Active,
and if it's for longer than your four

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18742-1
02:53:51.989 --> 02:53:55.224
weeks rules that we might set,
then it might be approval, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18757-0
02:53:57.764 --> 02:54:00.750
And they could equally say, well,
actually I'm going to add to that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18757-1
02:54:00.750 --> 02:54:02.524
I'm coming in on Monday. Is it available?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18804-0
02:54:04.064 --> 02:54:06.626
And that may be if there's a fee on that,
it's Brookdale.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18804-1
02:54:06.626 --> 02:54:09.984
There might be a conversation with the
Thea, I want to say, could you park?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18805-0
02:54:09.984 --> 02:54:10.104
You.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18806-0
02:54:10.104 --> 02:54:13.539
Know there's no other space available.
Could you park?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18806-1
02:54:13.539 --> 02:54:18.224
There's a recommended space, you know.
Hundred chance. OK, that's logical.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18807-0
02:54:18.424 --> 02:54:20.784
Do we want to be asking for justification
up front?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18824-0
02:54:23.304 --> 02:54:28.016
I would say I haven't seen. No,
I haven't seen because there's not high

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18824-1
02:54:28.016 --> 02:54:30.504
volume car parking at London everyone.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18859-0
02:54:30.024 --> 02:54:30.664
Just because his.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18860-0
02:54:30.704 --> 02:54:34.443
Name. Sorry,
I think it's about the sustainability.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18842-0
02:54:34.214 --> 02:54:36.614
Are you bringing cooked? Yeah, the cooked.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18860-1
02:54:34.443 --> 02:54:37.104
Let's be clear. Is it before it gets?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18862-0
02:54:37.104 --> 02:54:40.744
Out of control, like Glasgow? Yeah.
Said before COVID, nothing happened. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18898-0
02:54:41.264 --> 02:54:41.824
So it could be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18899-0
02:54:41.824 --> 02:54:42.584
Have I think.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18900-0
02:54:43.184 --> 02:54:46.144
Rules in place because then it just helps
with like consistent even just from a.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18881-0
02:54:46.364 --> 02:54:46.964
Change the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18901-0
02:54:46.624 --> 02:54:49.583
Perspective and what Simon's saying about
culture. Yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18901-1
02:54:49.583 --> 02:54:52.957
like tech can only do so much.
But if we just set the President,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18901-2
02:54:52.957 --> 02:54:53.424
actually.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18914-0
02:54:54.784 --> 02:54:55.904
These are the rules based on.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18911-0
02:54:55.224 --> 02:54:55.584
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18915-0
02:54:55.904 --> 02:54:57.864
How we work, I'm sure, I'm sure that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18919-0
02:55:00.384 --> 02:55:00.824
Numbers.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18938-0
02:55:03.494 --> 02:55:03.694
Or.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18939-0
02:55:07.014 --> 02:55:10.578
Congestion charge before that, you know,
there was a space and you might have your

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18939-1
02:55:10.578 --> 02:55:11.094
family like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18940-0
02:55:11.094 --> 02:55:12.134
Can I actually just?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18964-0
02:55:15.314 --> 02:55:19.326
Working that day,
so I'm sure that doesn't happen,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18964-1
02:55:19.326 --> 02:55:23.810
but as you said,
maybe reasons for parking there not for

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18963-0
02:55:22.734 --> 02:55:23.214
I got no.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18964-2
02:55:23.810 --> 02:55:24.754
personal or?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18970-0
02:55:25.884 --> 02:55:26.924
For example.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18973-0
02:55:26.434 --> 02:55:28.634
Again, that is our approval task, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18977-0
02:55:28.784 --> 02:55:29.744
Yeah, it's very good.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18979-0
02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:32.301
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
because the the benefit of doing that is</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18979-1
02:55:32.301 --> 02:55:35.070
<v Mark Sedge>you could do,
you could provide knowledge articles</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18979-2
02:55:35.070 --> 02:55:39.467
<v Mark Sedge>which explain these are the criteria that
is acceptable and then they can either</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18979-3
02:55:39.467 --> 02:55:43.430
<v Mark Sedge>align to that and if they've got an
exception, it makes approval easier.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18980-0
02:55:44.234 --> 02:55:44.394
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/18995-0
02:55:46.474 --> 02:55:50.514
But we can't.
We can't even have see our book Saturday.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19001-0
02:55:51.074 --> 02:55:52.634
So I'm saying that's what I'm saying for
not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19002-0
02:55:52.634 --> 02:55:54.754
Working but you just declined.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19020-0
02:55:55.754 --> 02:56:00.394
No, because we've got stuff again.
Social Security is there. So let's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19021-0
02:56:01.294 --> 02:56:01.454
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19022-0
02:56:01.454 --> 02:56:02.214
So that's and for.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19031-0
02:56:04.594 --> 02:56:06.914
That's our policy. We're coming in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19051-0
02:56:06.424 --> 02:56:10.714
So I have to work Monday,
Friday but see I book to Saturday so that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19051-1
02:56:10.714 --> 02:56:14.184
I don't need to pay to park on the street
and go shop.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19055-0
02:56:14.744 --> 02:56:15.624
Some people might.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19056-0
02:56:15.624 --> 02:56:16.464
Book it for say like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19057-0
02:56:16.464 --> 02:56:17.824
A workshop or something like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19075-0
02:56:22.304 --> 02:56:23.864
It's a team for work purposes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19076-0
02:56:23.944 --> 02:56:26.184
So not working as it's not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19077-0
02:56:25.314 --> 02:56:25.914
That.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19095-0
02:56:27.824 --> 02:56:32.584
A little bit that should be on like,
so there's things as well we have.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19096-0
02:56:32.584 --> 02:56:35.384
Like for credit cards, for instance,
for corporate credit cards.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19127-0
02:56:37.104 --> 02:56:41.250
I'm just thinking we have automated rules,
so even if your internal stuff and you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19127-1
02:56:41.250 --> 02:56:45.447
typically wouldn't use a corporate credit
card even if you wanted to apply for it,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19127-2
02:56:45.447 --> 02:56:48.784
it would be automatically like systems
that computers. That's no.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19130-0
02:56:50.174 --> 02:56:51.494
Not not for the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19150-0
02:56:51.864 --> 02:56:52.784
It might be available.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19151-0
02:56:52.784 --> 02:56:55.915
So the reason for justification of,
you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19151-1
02:56:55.915 --> 02:56:59.590
or the fact that you don't typically work
a Saturday,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19149-0
02:56:59.434 --> 02:56:59.714
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19151-2
02:56:59.590 --> 02:57:01.904
you know there are work Saturdays.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19153-0
02:57:03.514 --> 02:57:04.194
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19169-0
02:57:05.914 --> 02:57:09.994
More are those the ones that really need
approval? You can't just book them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19198-0
02:57:10.464 --> 02:57:14.744
See that as we can, it's usually it.
So they are, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19170-0
02:57:10.674 --> 02:57:10.914
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19181-0
02:57:14.914 --> 02:57:15.514
That was it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19199-0
02:57:15.624 --> 02:57:19.961
Yeah. Yeah. And you capture that,
you know? So yeah, as you said,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19199-1
02:57:19.961 --> 02:57:22.984
reasons for driving in can be captured.
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19200-0
02:57:23.104 --> 02:57:24.744
Yeah. Do you report on that sort of stuff?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19202-0
02:57:25.504 --> 02:57:25.664
At the moment.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19204-0
02:57:27.184 --> 02:57:27.264
Actually.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19213-0
02:57:27.894 --> 02:57:30.214
It is rare that we can say we have.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19242-0
02:57:30.104 --> 02:57:30.784
Yeah, that's good.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19243-0
02:57:31.384 --> 02:57:34.504
I'll likely do it like all the time.
It's maybe like if we need an event.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19244-0
02:57:34.504 --> 02:57:38.904
Going on so might again better than that.
Like they don't use it at the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19245-0
02:57:39.024 --> 02:57:40.344
Other time as as well so even.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19246-0
02:57:40.344 --> 02:57:42.064
If they wanted to, like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19256-0
02:57:43.774 --> 02:57:50.014
It could be entry to car park,
entry to office.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19250-0
02:57:45.374 --> 02:57:46.094
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19265-0
02:57:51.744 --> 02:57:54.104
Entry department only never came.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19269-0
02:57:56.114 --> 02:57:57.474
Hang back at 1:00 AM.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19295-0
02:57:59.184 --> 02:57:59.304
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19280-0
02:57:59.314 --> 02:58:02.394
And you can start to see those, but yes,
but we can grade those.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19296-0
02:58:03.944 --> 02:58:07.229
So low volumes,
but you can see that I think that reason

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19296-1
02:58:07.229 --> 02:58:09.304
for justification probably captures.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19298-0
02:58:11.024 --> 02:58:11.184
That.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19314-0
02:58:12.134 --> 02:58:16.334
You could have like a drop down or rather
than a few.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19315-0
02:58:16.334 --> 02:58:16.494
Text.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19316-0
02:58:16.494 --> 02:58:16.654
Just.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19357-0
02:58:22.834 --> 02:58:26.254
Because it'll be planned down time.
Plan scheduling.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19357-1
02:58:26.254 --> 02:58:29.222
You said it tend to be client work,
but yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19357-2
02:58:29.222 --> 02:58:32.900
and other they could start to add stuff
and we could we,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19357-3
02:58:32.900 --> 02:58:37.868
you know once you get others you can
start to incorporate that back into the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19352-0
02:58:35.934 --> 02:58:36.294
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19357-4
02:58:37.868 --> 02:58:38.514
check box.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19375-0
02:58:39.364 --> 02:58:42.004
Drop down list. Yep, makes sense.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19361-0
02:58:39.524 --> 02:58:39.844
Mitchell.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19376-0
02:58:42.644 --> 02:58:46.284
Motorbike parking that just squeezes into
one of those spaces or is that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19390-0
02:58:46.474 --> 02:58:52.874
And again, that is yes,
more vegan's I say that process because.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19385-0
02:58:47.984 --> 02:58:49.144
Do they tend to have more?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19401-0
02:58:54.474 --> 02:58:55.114
You need to pay for.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19402-0
02:58:55.114 --> 02:58:55.194
It.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19404-0
02:58:55.714 --> 02:58:57.234
So, and it's only in London.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19405-0
02:58:57.834 --> 02:58:58.194
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19414-0
02:58:58.584 --> 02:59:01.304
That's because they don't have to be fee
owners to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19426-0
02:59:01.514 --> 02:59:06.321
Yes, anybody, if you if you want to,
if you're a national employee and you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19426-1
02:59:06.321 --> 02:59:06.834
want to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19441-0
02:59:08.794 --> 02:59:12.578
A bike space? It's not just a talk.
You need to basically take it all as one

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19441-1
02:59:12.578 --> 02:59:13.954
or don't take it at all. So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19451-0
02:59:15.734 --> 02:59:15.894
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19450-0
02:59:15.954 --> 02:59:18.514
No, no.
We can take it as long as you want.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19468-0
02:59:21.104 --> 02:59:25.051
OK. So that's something that's agreed,
but that again like the and there's a

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19457-0
02:59:21.754 --> 02:59:22.154
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19468-1
02:59:25.051 --> 02:59:26.384
particular space for that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19472-0
02:59:26.474 --> 02:59:28.314
Yes, yes. And again that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19478-0
02:59:29.334 --> 02:59:29.494
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19489-0
02:59:29.914 --> 02:59:30.994
'S only so many species.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19490-0
02:59:30.994 --> 02:59:34.154
Etcetera. So there's another there's, say,
a Bank of four.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19524-0
02:59:36.314 --> 02:59:38.699
Again,
like the assets or the room booking,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19524-1
02:59:38.699 --> 02:59:42.710
they become active inactive, yes.
So you know that they've booked it from

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19524-2
02:59:42.710 --> 02:59:45.257
first January or they do it for summer
months,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19524-3
02:59:45.257 --> 02:59:49.594
March to October and they start getting
you know, they're riding in the winter.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19544-0
02:59:50.244 --> 02:59:53.364
But they're booked out and they can't be
allocated to someone.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19545-0
02:59:53.364 --> 02:59:54.364
Else again and that's just.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19546-0
02:59:54.364 --> 02:59:56.124
A spreadsheet the security use to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19560-0
02:59:56.674 --> 02:59:58.114
See if it's in the species and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19561-0
02:59:58.594 --> 03:00:01.879
Does security manager,
so presumably who triggers that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19561-1
03:00:01.879 --> 03:00:03.194
activation request it?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19589-0
03:00:02.414 --> 03:00:02.614
To ask.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19590-0
03:00:02.694 --> 03:00:07.643
You next to see if there any streets left,
and then we we is security.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19590-1
03:00:07.643 --> 03:00:11.757
Find it with any species like and then
let them know. Yep.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19590-2
03:00:11.757 --> 03:00:14.894
There's a space here and it's such and
such.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19594-0
03:00:16.994 --> 03:00:18.154
Your period or.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19598-0
03:00:19.634 --> 03:00:19.874
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19618-0
03:00:20.634 --> 03:00:22.034
Be they would have to be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19619-0
03:00:22.074 --> 03:00:25.690
So it's a great knowledge article.
I want to part my motive.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19619-1
03:00:25.690 --> 03:00:29.070
What do I need to do?
And then there's the request form.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19619-2
03:00:29.070 --> 03:00:30.434
This is how much it is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19620-0
03:00:30.594 --> 03:00:31.754
It's not free.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19626-0
03:00:32.774 --> 03:00:34.534
It's kind of come out your payroll.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19656-0
03:00:36.074 --> 03:00:38.646
You know,
probably actually there's the other bike

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19656-1
03:00:38.646 --> 03:00:40.967
to work scheme as well.
We were touched upon.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19656-2
03:00:40.967 --> 03:00:44.851
Do you want to continue? Oh gosh,
how much is it a month? You know how much?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19656-3
03:00:44.851 --> 03:00:47.474
And then you might decide that you want
to proceed.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19661-0
03:00:50.624 --> 03:00:51.704
So that could be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19664-0
03:00:53.884 --> 03:00:54.244
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19675-0
03:00:54.824 --> 03:00:58.904
Yeah. And we advise payroll,
but as a part of a meeting.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19688-0
03:00:59.584 --> 03:01:03.544
Except try for example,
they would just be invoiced OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19689-0
03:01:04.304 --> 03:01:06.992
Yeah,
those appear will be on ServiceNow

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19689-1
03:01:06.992 --> 03:01:08.304
eventually at least.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19690-0
03:01:07.790 --> 03:01:11.397
<v Mark Sedge>I was just going to say this is where we
can join it up because payroll will be on,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19690-1
03:01:11.397 --> 03:01:11.870
<v Mark Sedge>won't they?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19695-0
03:01:14.954 --> 03:01:17.474
Gain the volumes so so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19706-0
03:01:21.704 --> 03:01:24.344
Think so? We can check. Yeah,
we can check.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19709-0
03:01:24.510 --> 03:01:28.745
<v Mark Sedge>Would they, are they not? Oh, maybe I'm.
Maybe I'm imagining it,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19709-1
03:01:28.745 --> 03:01:30.310
<v Mark Sedge>but I thought they were.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19710-0
03:01:29.184 --> 03:01:29.504
I just.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19716-0
03:01:31.344 --> 03:01:35.744
They're not in asking they're culture.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19715-0
03:01:34.584 --> 03:01:36.064
Second, yeah, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19719-0
03:01:36.790 --> 03:01:38.630
<v Mark Sedge>Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19720-0
03:01:37.544 --> 03:01:37.664
So I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19722-0
03:01:40.230 --> 03:01:42.126
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
but there's no reason why they couldn't</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19722-1
03:01:42.126 --> 03:01:42.910
<v Mark Sedge>get a notification.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19724-0
03:01:42.704 --> 03:01:43.704
Know that's exactly.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19734-0
03:01:45.624 --> 03:01:49.664
Yeah, I've got that as a. Just a check.
OK, so and then.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19743-0
03:01:51.464 --> 03:01:53.944
So if they're not,
they get the invoice and they get that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19749-0
03:01:55.904 --> 03:01:58.624
Retrospectively,
at the end of every month, essentially.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19755-0
03:01:59.294 --> 03:02:01.094
And then so I think that the BBC.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19753-0
03:01:59.494 --> 03:01:59.934
And then.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19761-0
03:02:01.914 --> 03:02:04.474
Right. OK. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19778-0
03:02:04.584 --> 03:02:11.332
That's of your outsourced.
I'm just looking at that because I asked

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19778-1
03:02:11.332 --> 03:02:12.424
one or two.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19793-0
03:02:16.524 --> 03:02:16.724
Can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19794-0
03:02:18.244 --> 03:02:20.044
We just once Valley is it to chase up a
few.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19795-0
03:02:20.044 --> 03:02:20.924
Not see the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19796-0
03:02:20.924 --> 03:02:21.284
Money.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19802-0
03:02:23.314 --> 03:02:24.034
You don't, you don't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19803-0
03:02:24.034 --> 03:02:25.434
You don't swear. And how long? Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19806-0
03:02:26.630 --> 03:02:30.768
<v Mark Sedge>Would would you want on that form for
them to remind you. Having said that,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19806-1
03:02:30.768 --> 03:02:33.219
<v Mark Sedge>you'd be handling their bank details.
So no,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19806-2
03:02:33.219 --> 03:02:35.941
<v Mark Sedge>you'd probably have to do that
differently. Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19818-0
03:02:35.214 --> 03:02:39.960
Yeah, yeah,
because this is the query for the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19806-3
03:02:35.941 --> 03:02:37.630
<v Mark Sedge>Challenge my own thinking then.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19818-1
03:02:39.960 --> 03:02:44.294
activity mastering their data within them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19842-0
03:02:45.224 --> 03:02:50.536
I think there was bike permits,
although you have the right to right to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19842-1
03:02:50.536 --> 03:02:52.824
work schemes that Asha, so yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19851-0
03:02:52.994 --> 03:02:57.105
The bikes,
part of the bike and enough spaces for

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19859-0
03:02:55.824 --> 03:02:59.704
I saw again you would believe with
security to see.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19851-1
03:02:57.105 --> 03:02:57.434
the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19919-0
03:02:59.734 --> 03:02:59.774
I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19865-0
03:03:01.624 --> 03:03:02.504
Right. And then?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19920-0
03:03:02.374 --> 03:03:07.184
Mean that, but it's security on there,
you know, I mean, it's all inactive.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19879-0
03:03:05.544 --> 03:03:05.784
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19920-1
03:03:07.184 --> 03:03:11.424
Inactive anchor space. Yeah.
So that that alleviates that problem.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19890-0
03:03:08.984 --> 03:03:09.184
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19920-2
03:03:11.424 --> 03:03:16.740
So when you got the request even up front,
the request form can look up. I want to,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19920-3
03:03:16.740 --> 03:03:20.601
you know set the tone,
but before they've even requested it,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19920-4
03:03:20.601 --> 03:03:21.614
it's full. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19963-0
03:03:23.114 --> 03:03:26.370
You know that actually you don't need to
request at this point.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19963-1
03:03:26.370 --> 03:03:29.627
I don't know whether they can be on the
waiting list, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19935-0
03:03:28.044 --> 03:03:29.404
It's ever that's a good thing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19963-2
03:03:29.627 --> 03:03:32.833
or they could be on the waiting list.
First come, first serve,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19963-3
03:03:32.833 --> 03:03:37.107
probably a growing bank though, isn't it?
And that's when you think I'm at capacity

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19963-4
03:03:37.107 --> 03:03:38.634
for hashers. Do I need to get?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19964-0
03:03:38.634 --> 03:03:39.274
More.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19972-0
03:03:40.354 --> 03:03:42.634
Bike there more people are bike biking to
work.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19979-0
03:03:44.094 --> 03:03:45.174
You know, like that I think it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19995-0
03:03:45.434 --> 03:03:49.388
For security,
I don't have to do that already and check

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19995-1
03:03:49.388 --> 03:03:52.706
yes,
see if it's still been used or still here

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/19995-2
03:03:52.706 --> 03:03:53.554
etcetera so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20015-0
03:03:54.174 --> 03:03:54.254
Oh.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20002-0
03:03:54.364 --> 03:03:54.524
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20016-0
03:03:55.214 --> 03:03:59.358
But that would be leave us join this.
Leave us. Leave us. Process that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20016-1
03:03:59.358 --> 03:04:02.696
If you've left,
that triggers that your bike space should

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20016-2
03:04:02.696 --> 03:04:03.214
probably.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20035-0
03:04:05.564 --> 03:04:08.746
Yeah,
but all of those we could join those up,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20035-1
03:04:08.746 --> 03:04:12.742
that becomes, you know,
if you leave your bike space, yes,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20035-2
03:04:12.742 --> 03:04:14.164
you know all of that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20040-0
03:04:16.484 --> 03:04:17.564
Stopping paid.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20043-0
03:04:19.604 --> 03:04:22.004
Things that could happen,
but your bike space.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20049-0
03:04:20.630 --> 03:04:23.625
<v Mark Sedge>To to expand on that,
Deborah to expand on that, that,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20045-0
03:04:23.084 --> 03:04:23.204
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20049-1
03:04:23.625 --> 03:04:27.764
<v Mark Sedge>that should also mean you know that
whether you've booked meeting rooms and</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20049-2
03:04:27.764 --> 03:04:30.759
<v Mark Sedge>things like that,
they get checked because it wouldn't</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20049-3
03:04:30.759 --> 03:04:34.843
<v Mark Sedge>necessarily get cancelled because you
might have booked one and somebody's</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20048-0
03:04:31.384 --> 03:04:31.584
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20049-4
03:04:34.843 --> 03:04:36.750
<v Mark Sedge>taken over and still going to need.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20051-0
03:04:37.190 --> 03:04:40.572
<v Mark Sedge>To do the work,
but there needs to be a mechanism where</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20051-1
03:04:40.572 --> 03:04:45.223
<v Mark Sedge>anything that you've pre booked car by
whatever is just validated checked as</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20051-2
03:04:45.223 --> 03:04:46.190
<v Mark Sedge>part of leavers.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20054-0
03:04:47.510 --> 03:04:51.731
<v Mark Sedge>The potentially there might also be
movers because if you say you're moving</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20053-0
03:04:47.774 --> 03:04:48.094
So that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20054-1
03:04:51.731 --> 03:04:54.897
<v Mark Sedge>from, I don't know,
UK to oz or something and you've got</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20054-2
03:04:54.897 --> 03:04:58.230
<v Mark Sedge>those things. Again,
you'd want to be cancelling those and.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20055-0
03:05:00.190 --> 03:05:00.630
<v Mark Sedge>You know.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20069-0
03:05:00.314 --> 03:05:03.705
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
I'm moving from here to here,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20062-0
03:05:03.550 --> 03:05:03.910
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20069-1
03:05:03.705 --> 03:05:05.234
and I give up my space.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20081-0
03:05:04.694 --> 03:05:08.174
I think it's just because the spaces are
not and the system is just a.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20082-0
03:05:08.174 --> 03:05:10.294
Spreadsheet, but they could well be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20083-0
03:05:10.430 --> 03:05:12.790
<v Mark Sedge>No, but we could put them in the system.
That's the point.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20116-0
03:05:13.654 --> 03:05:16.493
It's not actually you just park your bike
like a car.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20116-1
03:05:16.493 --> 03:05:20.910
You need to be able in a particular space,
but presumably with a is it a bike rack?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20116-2
03:05:20.910 --> 03:05:24.854
I don't even know what they it might,
but you've seen them, but sometimes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20144-0
03:05:25.994 --> 03:05:28.722
OK, so it might be,
but you can if you arrive in three is

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20144-1
03:05:28.722 --> 03:05:31.874
available, you just park your bike there,
you know, it's probably.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20145-0
03:05:31.874 --> 03:05:32.274
Not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20146-0
03:05:32.594 --> 03:05:35.714
It's a capacity thing rather than an
actual.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20167-0
03:05:37.634 --> 03:05:40.274
It might be a decimated right,
but it would be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20168-0
03:05:40.714 --> 03:05:44.954
Good to actually I guess designated space,
yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20170-0
03:05:41.354 --> 03:05:44.994
OK, that's it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20173-0
03:05:44.790 --> 03:05:48.404
<v Mark Sedge>There'd be rails, aren't they?
If it's anything like the ones that I've</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20173-1
03:05:48.404 --> 03:05:51.517
<v Mark Sedge>used where you have rails,
you ride the bike into your slots.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20173-2
03:05:51.517 --> 03:05:54.630
<v Mark Sedge>Do you know what I mean?
They have the sort of under shelter.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20182-0
03:05:53.384 --> 03:05:57.040
Is it? Yeah.
The one thing is it a dedicated number

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20182-1
03:05:57.040 --> 03:05:58.024
for your bike?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20187-0
03:05:57.664 --> 03:06:01.104
I'll be honest with that process.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20181-0
03:05:57.990 --> 03:05:58.390
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20188-0
03:06:03.350 --> 03:06:03.470
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20193-0
03:06:04.074 --> 03:06:05.834
But we've done it the same way.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20239-0
03:06:07.884 --> 03:06:11.344
As the yes,
but you might want to get a bike.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20207-0
03:06:08.464 --> 03:06:12.024
Luminess is part of joiners as well as
processing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20239-1
03:06:11.344 --> 03:06:16.458
You're here. You've got use to it.
I'm feeling, you know, actually,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20239-2
03:06:16.458 --> 03:06:21.799
it's quicker for me to ride in.
I get the incentive for my bike to be,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20239-3
03:06:21.799 --> 03:06:23.604
you know, right to work.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20245-0
03:06:22.674 --> 03:06:27.634
Is it an off the back? It's definitely no.
Just take it as well.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20256-0
03:06:28.954 --> 03:06:30.954
No, this is not going to be here guys.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20287-0
03:06:29.434 --> 03:06:34.744
Because it's a UB, the space. Oh,
that's because you've got a bicycle tag,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20287-1
03:06:34.744 --> 03:06:36.514
so you get a bicycle tag.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20288-0
03:06:36.514 --> 03:06:37.554
All you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20272-0
03:06:36.590 --> 03:06:37.030
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20289-0
03:06:37.554 --> 03:06:41.834
See. Yeah. So it's it's not.
I thought you just can't. It's not like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20292-0
03:06:41.550 --> 03:06:46.900
<v Mark Sedge>The the the other reason they do that and
just I'll ask the question from my own</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20291-0
03:06:42.324 --> 03:06:43.604
Yeah, exactly. You can't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20292-1
03:06:46.900 --> 03:06:51.855
<v Mark Sedge>experience that it prevents damage,
right and and and if you've got tag to</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20292-2
03:06:51.855 --> 03:06:56.809
<v Mark Sedge>say someone knocks your or scratches or
whatever especially with high tech</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20292-3
03:06:56.809 --> 03:06:57.470
<v Mark Sedge>machinery.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20295-0
03:06:58.590 --> 03:07:03.150
<v Mark Sedge>You'd have allocated spaces, as I say,
to keep risk of bikes falling over not</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20295-1
03:07:03.150 --> 03:07:06.306
<v Mark Sedge>being locked properly,
and all of that kind of stuff,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20295-2
03:07:06.306 --> 03:07:08.470
<v Mark Sedge>so it must be the same as that, yeah?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20316-0
03:07:09.244 --> 03:07:12.844
And it's a case of the basically tag,
you know who owns that bike.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20316-1
03:07:12.844 --> 03:07:16.444
So if he's left and he's left that bike
there, what happens to it?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20307-0
03:07:12.994 --> 03:07:13.474
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20330-0
03:07:18.994 --> 03:07:22.074
Is the bicycle belonging to Ashurst or do
you all be there?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20329-0
03:07:20.604 --> 03:07:21.684
No, I'll be there.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20348-0
03:07:24.164 --> 03:07:26.512
Yeah.
And equally it could be the usage of that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20331-0
03:07:24.190 --> 03:07:24.510
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20348-1
03:07:26.512 --> 03:07:29.644
space. But like meeting rooms, you know,
they could do that so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20388-0
03:07:30.364 --> 03:07:34.958
Fact that you said that you wanted a bike
space and you've never used it, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20388-1
03:07:34.958 --> 03:07:39.443
maybe a month you've been given a month
for usage or it's in that it's you booked

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20388-2
03:07:39.443 --> 03:07:42.943
it out, is it we can,
it can be made available to someone else.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20388-3
03:07:42.943 --> 03:07:46.444
So there's an incentive.
If you say you're going to write work.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20402-0
03:07:47.474 --> 03:07:47.914
Yes, need to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20403-0
03:07:48.914 --> 03:07:49.074
Work.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20400-0
03:07:50.104 --> 03:07:50.904
So it's there.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20404-0
03:07:50.914 --> 03:07:51.594
OK. Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20407-0
03:07:53.284 --> 03:07:53.604
Are you?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20409-0
03:07:54.314 --> 03:07:54.594
That.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20414-0
03:07:55.924 --> 03:07:57.844
Yeah. And with security, no.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20430-0
03:07:59.564 --> 03:08:03.475
That activity I mean,
is it sort of what happened in tapped out

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20430-1
03:08:03.475 --> 03:08:03.964
type of?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20435-0
03:08:04.104 --> 03:08:05.904
I would assume that would know with.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20436-0
03:08:06.104 --> 03:08:06.424
The.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20463-0
03:08:08.754 --> 03:08:09.794
Pass, so obviously need to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20464-0
03:08:09.794 --> 03:08:11.274
Go into the bike area.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20465-0
03:08:11.994 --> 03:08:12.154
And.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20466-0
03:08:12.154 --> 03:08:14.674
Then that report could be pulled from
that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20467-0
03:08:14.914 --> 03:08:17.434
OK, maybe we can part that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20492-0
03:08:17.054 --> 03:08:19.054
Once security you receive you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20493-0
03:08:19.454 --> 03:08:20.614
Know that we've got the pairs I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20494-0
03:08:20.614 --> 03:08:23.453
Don't think I can't remember if they're
on the pairs or not,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20494-1
03:08:23.453 --> 03:08:25.734
but I know they receive like a weekly
join, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20527-0
03:08:26.324 --> 03:08:32.582
So we can get from the thing off the back
about the cancel the card and stuff so we

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20541-0
03:08:27.234 --> 03:08:27.474
There.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20542-0
03:08:27.794 --> 03:08:27.834
I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20512-0
03:08:30.964 --> 03:08:31.644
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20543-0
03:08:31.274 --> 03:08:31.754
Yeah, but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20527-1
03:08:32.582 --> 03:08:36.083
can go.
I'm assuming it's maybe one to pick up

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20573-0
03:08:33.884 --> 03:08:34.284
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20574-0
03:08:35.044 --> 03:08:35.164
I'm.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20527-2
03:08:36.083 --> 03:08:40.404
and if it's only for a short. Yeah, yeah,
certainly, but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20575-0
03:08:37.204 --> 03:08:37.724
Workshop.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20576-0
03:08:38.524 --> 03:08:43.956
Yeah, yeah, suddenly. But to request it,
you would know upfront that actually 10

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20576-1
03:08:43.956 --> 03:08:47.644
people and then again a bit like car
parking, however.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20605-0
03:08:48.524 --> 03:08:51.835
Locally,
these are the other available available

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20605-1
03:08:51.835 --> 03:08:55.687
bike lanes, so that could give them.
It's not available.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20589-0
03:08:52.484 --> 03:08:53.004
Mm-hmm. Well.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20605-2
03:08:55.687 --> 03:09:00.688
Now you're on the waiting list,
but you can still buy to work and you can

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20605-3
03:09:00.688 --> 03:09:01.364
park here.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20608-0
03:09:02.024 --> 03:09:03.624
Or you need to apply.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20623-0
03:09:05.164 --> 03:09:09.564
To this other and some recommendations
after that, OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20648-0
03:09:09.474 --> 03:09:12.171
It's OK,
they can actually need to be involved at

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20648-1
03:09:12.171 --> 03:09:14.114
all. The going straight to security.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20649-0
03:09:14.314 --> 03:09:14.994
No or not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20650-0
03:09:15.394 --> 03:09:17.394
Again, it should. It could be a necessary.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20663-0
03:09:17.404 --> 03:09:21.165
Yes, that's what I mean. Yeah,
that's good.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20663-1
03:09:21.165 --> 03:09:26.124
And they can't squeeze their bike into
the fee car space.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20671-0
03:09:36.884 --> 03:09:38.924
I'm sure they're fiestas.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20675-0
03:09:41.124 --> 03:09:41.684
Hard down there.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20698-0
03:09:44.104 --> 03:09:48.170
And then so for instance,
it benefits that people have, like,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20698-1
03:09:48.170 --> 03:09:51.647
I don't know,
you can have the Tesla and rather than

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20698-2
03:09:51.647 --> 03:09:54.664
pay, is that part,
do you manage any of that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20695-0
03:09:53.434 --> 03:09:53.954
No, no.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20709-0
03:09:55.434 --> 03:10:00.262
It shows that actually just thinking
about that right to work schemes as well

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20709-1
03:10:00.262 --> 03:10:01.314
is the fact that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20737-0
03:10:02.634 --> 03:10:06.569
Promoting way to work,
but I actually don't even have a space.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20737-1
03:10:06.569 --> 03:10:10.130
I suppose that's another.
That's a conversation that the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20737-2
03:10:10.130 --> 03:10:13.754
applicant's capacity should match the
capacity that's in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20769-0
03:10:14.804 --> 03:10:18.452
The building so that could be a report
that's pulled just to make sure it's

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20769-1
03:10:18.452 --> 03:10:20.804
being matched.
I don't refer to how many people.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20770-0
03:10:21.404 --> 03:10:28.644
I mean, it's just I'd hope for Glasgow.
So we just right, so there's no.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20776-0
03:10:29.704 --> 03:10:29.984
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20799-0
03:10:29.884 --> 03:10:33.880
Yeah. OK. So we'll ask, that's different,
but this it could be that as capacity

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20799-1
03:10:33.880 --> 03:10:37.526
grows and you want some security,
you use the process for and they still

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20799-2
03:10:37.526 --> 03:10:39.324
need to maybe they should or should.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20815-0
03:10:44.804 --> 03:10:45.284
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20816-0
03:10:45.324 --> 03:10:47.841
No passport,
but it could be that they're still

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20816-1
03:10:47.841 --> 03:10:50.044
utilising the same process, maybe yeah, I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20817-0
03:10:50.964 --> 03:10:51.724
Can have a look at that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20829-0
03:11:00.304 --> 03:11:04.144
Is there any more transportation?
We've done. Motorbike taxi. Taxi.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20837-0
03:11:04.594 --> 03:11:08.234
I think that would just be hopefully.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20844-0
03:11:10.804 --> 03:11:13.044
Again, it came through.
It's an approval task.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20875-0
03:11:18.804 --> 03:11:25.615
That is going to be approved so everyone
attended a meeting in London and you're

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20875-1
03:11:25.615 --> 03:11:29.484
at again, but you need to leave. Yes,
we can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20878-0
03:11:30.464 --> 03:11:30.944
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20882-0
03:11:32.004 --> 03:11:32.644
And through the account.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20914-0
03:11:32.884 --> 03:11:37.289
OK, so who can book?
So the trigger today is that you get into

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20914-1
03:11:37.289 --> 03:11:41.764
show a request by taxi and they need to
say is that pre booked?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20897-0
03:11:38.624 --> 03:11:39.184
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20915-0
03:11:41.924 --> 03:11:49.004
So London are only booked as a client,
is that is that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20922-0
03:11:50.014 --> 03:11:51.774
If the actual client is in attendance.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20923-0
03:11:51.324 --> 03:11:51.684
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20931-0
03:11:52.914 --> 03:11:54.274
In the taxi review, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20942-0
03:11:53.444 --> 03:11:53.524
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20943-0
03:11:55.004 --> 03:11:55.724
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20944-0
03:11:55.724 --> 03:11:58.644
I'm not just in the meeting we have.
They have to be in the taxi.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20945-0
03:11:57.814 --> 03:11:59.254
So so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20947-0
03:12:00.364 --> 03:12:01.244
To be entertained.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20989-0
03:12:01.854 --> 03:12:05.167
At all times.
So either you can book a taxi with the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20989-1
03:12:05.167 --> 03:12:08.355
client,
or you can book your client a taxi, right?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20971-0
03:12:07.134 --> 03:12:07.654
Right, right.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20989-2
03:12:08.355 --> 03:12:13.481
So it's got to be basically it's just a
client, so it can be challenged to, yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20989-3
03:12:13.481 --> 03:12:17.294
either my number most mostly don't want
to charge the taxes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20987-0
03:12:15.514 --> 03:12:15.714
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21020-0
03:12:18.124 --> 03:12:23.415
Because it's the tax expenses in London.
So previously we looked at all the time

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/20997-0
03:12:18.394 --> 03:12:18.954
Is this the?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21020-1
03:12:23.415 --> 03:12:27.204
and had to cut back.
So it's only our client is attended.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21017-0
03:12:27.464 --> 03:12:27.704
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21021-0
03:12:27.724 --> 03:12:29.204
So the request comes in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21025-0
03:12:30.354 --> 03:12:30.634
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21031-0
03:12:31.524 --> 03:12:34.244
You get an e-mail to say,
but you only matter number.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21047-0
03:12:34.514 --> 03:12:37.900
So there's a validation on that 4/3,
I don't know 432.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21047-1
03:12:37.900 --> 03:12:40.794
So we can validate that who's the client
name?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21053-0
03:12:41.854 --> 03:12:42.974
I do. It's the video that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21068-0
03:12:42.644 --> 03:12:46.398
And who's the?
So that could be all for the PE conduance.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21068-1
03:12:46.398 --> 03:12:47.564
Yes, on behalf of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21074-0
03:12:49.034 --> 03:12:49.234
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21091-0
03:12:49.604 --> 03:12:54.803
Their partner and that could be mandatory
data that Ben lands with yourself.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21091-1
03:12:54.803 --> 03:12:55.884
How much notice?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21092-0
03:12:56.124 --> 03:12:56.364
Could.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21093-0
03:12:56.364 --> 03:12:59.084
Be on the day. Yeah. Could you bring it?
Could be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21123-0
03:12:58.404 --> 03:13:00.604
As soon as possible.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21124-0
03:13:00.964 --> 03:13:06.412
So the fact that they've populated client
Fiona partner matter number is that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21124-1
03:13:06.412 --> 03:13:10.044
assumed approval or do you then need to
for London?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21125-0
03:13:08.244 --> 03:13:09.564
For London, yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21126-0
03:13:10.204 --> 03:13:11.044
Yes, OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21128-0
03:13:11.804 --> 03:13:12.444
School.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21134-0
03:13:14.484 --> 03:13:16.324
Essentially, if you've got a cost code.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21146-0
03:13:17.904 --> 03:13:22.104
But still rules clients. No, no,
it's a cost code based.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21149-0
03:13:23.644 --> 03:13:24.124
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21192-0
03:13:26.204 --> 03:13:28.735
See, we were going volunteering,
for example,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21192-1
03:13:28.735 --> 03:13:33.359
for they didn't hear something as long as
we kept cross code. Yeah. Then it's fine.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21192-2
03:13:33.359 --> 03:13:33.524
We.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21193-0
03:13:33.764 --> 03:13:38.830
Would know that cross code for that type
is a certain Costco, so it's 62110, right?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21193-1
03:13:38.830 --> 03:13:41.484
We would know that there's a pro bono
code.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21216-0
03:13:42.524 --> 03:13:45.105
If you see OK,
I'm going to find find my feedback going

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21216-1
03:13:45.105 --> 03:13:47.364
to use this code,
then we would question it, OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21229-0
03:13:47.504 --> 03:13:50.829
Right. But that rules can be up there.
So you enter your cost code. I mean,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21229-1
03:13:50.829 --> 03:13:54.024
obviously you can say actually I'll try
another one. So it goes through.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21266-0
03:13:55.604 --> 03:13:59.952
A new number of attempts to be counted,
but that you can put set those rules up

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21266-1
03:13:59.952 --> 03:14:04.191
front with that appropriate cost code.
Start commencing with the rules is the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21259-0
03:14:03.344 --> 03:14:03.744
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21266-2
03:14:04.191 --> 03:14:05.604
only time you can do much.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21300-0
03:14:07.044 --> 03:14:10.947
Yeah. So let's say get for instance.
Is it like our company and I was a Fiona,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21300-1
03:14:10.947 --> 03:14:14.604
can I not go and book a taxi and have to
climb with it? Do I always have?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21301-0
03:14:14.604 --> 03:14:20.188
To give you ask connect no so it just
usually the taxis. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21301-1
03:14:20.188 --> 03:14:22.404
So the taxis from London.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21313-0
03:14:24.354 --> 03:14:27.834
The the process could change because of
the volume so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21312-0
03:14:28.064 --> 03:14:28.544
That's fine.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21321-0
03:14:29.484 --> 03:14:32.244
The FIAS for using it to teach.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21334-0
03:14:34.284 --> 03:14:37.655
And to notebooks,
sort of the accounts for take that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21334-1
03:14:37.655 --> 03:14:38.164
product.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21339-0
03:14:40.324 --> 03:14:43.604
They were taking it to the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21356-0
03:14:44.004 --> 03:14:49.294
What is that speaking to like?
The concerts, not service for concerts.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21356-1
03:14:49.294 --> 03:14:51.604
It was like just just bringing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21367-0
03:14:51.684 --> 03:14:54.564
Yeah, it's really nice though.
Things are getting back up.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21385-0
03:14:53.264 --> 03:14:59.294
And it's miles and miles and miles. Miles.
OK, we need to change the process,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21385-1
03:14:59.294 --> 03:15:01.304
so if a fee and I want to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21386-0
03:15:01.304 --> 03:15:01.704
Taxi.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21387-0
03:15:02.624 --> 03:15:03.744
It's got to either use.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21438-0
03:15:05.684 --> 03:15:08.126
Or pay for that and get it being boxed.
Yeah, so,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21438-1
03:15:08.126 --> 03:15:09.884
but it's definitely for the clients.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21439-0
03:15:09.964 --> 03:15:13.579
So can you request?
So that's one scenario we've got the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21439-1
03:15:13.579 --> 03:15:16.814
client, yeah.
And we've got a matter number within

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21439-2
03:15:16.814 --> 03:15:19.986
there. We've got Glasgow, you know,
new location,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21439-3
03:15:19.986 --> 03:15:25.124
cost codes and it could be the rules up
front. But can the partner also request?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21459-0
03:15:25.434 --> 03:15:30.373
A taxi, if he supplies his own,
does he ever get to or do they just tend

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21459-1
03:15:30.373 --> 03:15:32.674
to get a new ball? Black cab here.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21508-0
03:15:32.354 --> 03:15:36.608
Yeah, we're just, we will go back.
So previously that you should try it all

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21508-1
03:15:36.608 --> 03:15:39.351
the time.
Like can you pick a taxi so that we've

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21508-2
03:15:39.351 --> 03:15:42.989
been told we need to go that's process.
So if they went through,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21508-3
03:15:42.989 --> 03:15:47.188
they come to us and say can I have a taxi?
I'm going in the airport. Yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21508-4
03:15:47.188 --> 03:15:51.834
I want to see go back to when they want
to. They'd use they know you need to like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21522-0
03:15:52.964 --> 03:15:54.404
Your own taxi through your own name.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21551-0
03:15:53.804 --> 03:15:58.222
Well, that's a great well, you know,
I've been cert and then it just stops it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21528-0
03:15:57.204 --> 03:15:57.324
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21551-1
03:15:58.222 --> 03:16:01.019
In the past,
you don't have to go back and forth,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21551-2
03:16:01.019 --> 03:16:05.437
think maybe we'll book it yourself.
We've got, you know, all your peers. Yeah,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21551-3
03:16:05.437 --> 03:16:06.724
we can book it or hair.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21588-0
03:16:08.404 --> 03:16:11.849
And that process works very well.
Do you get less of those?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21588-1
03:16:11.849 --> 03:16:15.524
So it sounds like it's been stopped
across that we can. OK, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21568-0
03:16:12.484 --> 03:16:14.444
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21589-0
03:16:15.524 --> 03:16:16.604
I've been going to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21574-0
03:16:15.874 --> 03:16:16.034
So I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21590-0
03:16:16.604 --> 03:16:20.071
Do it all in mysteria.
Last week you went with taxi plan.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21597-0
03:16:18.964 --> 03:16:23.404
Yes, he's booked a taxi for them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21590-1
03:16:20.071 --> 03:16:21.924
Do you do that from then? Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21591-0
03:16:22.844 --> 03:16:23.084
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21612-0
03:16:25.744 --> 03:16:26.184
And what?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21610-0
03:16:28.564 --> 03:16:29.524
So then we can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21613-0
03:16:29.384 --> 03:16:31.704
Was the justification for them,
so they're not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21614-0
03:16:31.764 --> 03:16:31.804
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21617-0
03:16:33.684 --> 03:16:34.804
Come on down.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21630-0
03:16:36.884 --> 03:16:40.307
Etcetera.
And let's see if they I don't mean so

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21630-1
03:16:40.307 --> 03:16:42.804
account but see because operations.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21634-0
03:16:44.174 --> 03:16:44.374
Mm-hmm.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21644-0
03:16:44.644 --> 03:16:48.663
They are essentially our stakeholder when
it comes to high school because they have

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21644-1
03:16:48.663 --> 03:16:49.764
been the bummer anyway.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21648-0
03:16:50.424 --> 03:16:51.584
So they request that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21651-0
03:16:51.804 --> 03:16:52.484
Operation.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21673-0
03:16:53.124 --> 03:16:55.118
Yeah.
So Operation Pass will request that we

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21673-1
03:16:55.118 --> 03:16:56.404
don't question that. We just.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21674-0
03:16:56.804 --> 03:16:57.844
OK, so as.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21675-0
03:16:58.164 --> 03:17:01.564
So requests for taxi, for example,
could have a drop down client.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21718-0
03:17:03.284 --> 03:17:06.172
Operational safety.
And then you've got these cost coding

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21718-1
03:17:06.172 --> 03:17:08.512
plans.
You know that's that could be the check

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21718-2
03:17:08.512 --> 03:17:10.604
box and then depending on what's selected.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21719-0
03:17:11.044 --> 03:17:11.804
Then the you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21720-0
03:17:12.164 --> 03:17:15.624
Know the client, as we said matter.
All those fields appear,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21720-1
03:17:15.624 --> 03:17:19.084
but the others it's a different set and
then for operations.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21752-0
03:17:20.194 --> 03:17:24.790
Who is more times and for their safety,
and then that's the that's all the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21752-1
03:17:24.790 --> 03:17:28.222
approval of funds are.
Then you just get the, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21752-2
03:17:28.222 --> 03:17:32.634
pick up points location that needs to be
populated where from where to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21776-0
03:17:36.004 --> 03:17:39.064
OK, probably stop.
Is there any stopping on,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21776-1
03:17:39.064 --> 03:17:42.192
you know I need to stop.
Could you stop here?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21776-2
03:17:42.192 --> 03:17:47.632
But expect to be pick up point on the end
what you've seen and start on top you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21776-3
03:17:47.632 --> 03:17:48.924
know date and time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21779-0
03:17:50.764 --> 03:17:51.804
Configured so that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21817-0
03:17:52.994 --> 03:17:54.834
Operations staff.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21818-0
03:17:55.554 --> 03:18:00.034
See the operations option nobody else
does. There's nobody else.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21820-0
03:18:00.674 --> 03:18:05.008
Yeah, exactly. So nobody else could. Yeah,
because when you do, your single sign on,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21820-1
03:18:05.008 --> 03:18:09.139
you could be part of a group that that,
that's the only option available to you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21820-2
03:18:09.139 --> 03:18:09.394
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21839-0
03:18:09.434 --> 03:18:10.914
Because I can, I can't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21840-0
03:18:10.914 --> 03:18:13.114
Put something there's operations,
no operations.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21841-0
03:18:13.114 --> 03:18:15.954
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
you could see it on behalf of the guy.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21857-0
03:18:14.764 --> 03:18:17.651
The reason could do that I would just put
it down.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21857-1
03:18:17.651 --> 03:18:22.123
It's obviously separate at London Clare
School, put the permissions in London.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21857-2
03:18:22.123 --> 03:18:24.444
Basically, that's a client in attendance.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21859-0
03:18:24.884 --> 03:18:25.164
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21878-0
03:18:25.104 --> 03:18:29.109
So yeah,
and that's that is that please use an

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21878-1
03:18:29.109 --> 03:18:32.944
alternative go. Yeah.
And just put you know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21882-0
03:18:36.434 --> 03:18:37.914
A link to Chrome #9.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21893-0
03:18:38.764 --> 03:18:41.484
And the operations,
ones and exceptions are they?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21918-0
03:18:40.884 --> 03:18:45.378
And then Glasgow.
So obviously anybody as long as we post

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21918-1
03:18:45.378 --> 03:18:49.329
code, yeah.
But the volumes again I'm not lacking,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21918-2
03:18:49.329 --> 03:18:51.964
so I wouldn't even worry about it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21927-0
03:18:52.874 --> 03:18:56.794
But they could reason for reason for
justification, justification again.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21931-0
03:18:54.204 --> 03:18:58.284
Yeah, yeah. And of course.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21941-0
03:18:57.184 --> 03:19:01.664
Mm-hmm. Yeah. So what's the cost code?
I think you mentioned it. If it's a six.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21952-0
03:19:01.984 --> 03:19:02.864
62 or.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21961-0
03:19:03.234 --> 03:19:04.194
Week auto populate that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21953-0
03:19:04.104 --> 03:19:05.144
Yeah, this is aye.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21962-0
03:19:04.194 --> 03:19:07.154
And then if they change it would you like?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21963-0
03:19:07.154 --> 03:19:08.514
That to become an approval.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21969-0
03:19:10.154 --> 03:19:12.354
They wouldn't change it to be fair.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21973-0
03:19:14.874 --> 03:19:17.154
Otherwise, it's for Glasgow.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21976-0
03:19:18.034 --> 03:19:18.394
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22013-0
03:19:19.074 --> 03:19:21.461
You don't.
It leaves them that they know it's

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/21985-0
03:19:20.684 --> 03:19:20.844
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22013-1
03:19:21.461 --> 03:19:25.508
they've got to enter it. Yeah. Yeah.
And so just to go back to that operation

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22013-2
03:19:25.508 --> 03:19:28.829
to put, they're rare,
but you want them to be on a request of a

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22013-3
03:19:28.829 --> 03:19:31.787
form up front.
If they're in operations to be able to do

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22013-4
03:19:31.787 --> 03:19:32.514
these sort of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22025-0
03:19:32.604 --> 03:19:34.964
Digit comes under just. Just do.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22015-0
03:19:33.834 --> 03:19:33.994
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22041-0
03:19:34.424 --> 03:19:35.384
Oh Yep, I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22026-0
03:19:34.964 --> 03:19:35.884
It straight away.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22042-0
03:19:35.384 --> 03:19:38.457
Think sometimes operation you'll say no
on codes from other people,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22042-1
03:19:38.457 --> 03:19:41.304
but it's not actual operation.
So we still want them to, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22054-0
03:19:42.434 --> 03:19:43.754
So it's just the 2.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22048-0
03:19:43.554 --> 03:19:43.874
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22055-0
03:19:44.154 --> 03:19:48.034
I really think it's high school this
relationship.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22096-0
03:19:50.484 --> 03:19:55.284
Like as a client as a client there. Yeah,
that's it. OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22097-0
03:19:55.284 --> 03:19:56.404
What we don't need?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22098-0
03:19:56.684 --> 03:19:56.884
Is.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22099-0
03:19:57.044 --> 03:20:01.676
That could be like just because it's not.
I kind of agree with Deborah. It's good,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22099-1
03:20:01.676 --> 03:20:06.085
just have consistency because you don't
want to wait for an issue and then say

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22099-2
03:20:06.085 --> 03:20:06.364
yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22126-0
03:20:08.374 --> 03:20:11.944
I use the operation.
Sorry dictate on that. Like Bill Gates,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22126-1
03:20:11.944 --> 03:20:15.223
taxes and code.
So I actually need to look sort of like

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22126-2
03:20:15.223 --> 03:20:15.574
again.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22116-0
03:20:16.134 --> 03:20:17.054
That's fine.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22127-0
03:20:17.054 --> 03:20:21.574
Low volumes, aren't they very. You know,
it's not out of control behaviour.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22130-0
03:20:23.674 --> 03:20:24.554
Would you say I mean?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22147-0
03:20:26.314 --> 03:20:32.834
It's a case of the charity stuff that's
doing or operations. Yeah. Do you?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22148-0
03:20:33.194 --> 03:20:34.554
Know what I mean? So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22187-0
03:20:35.034 --> 03:20:35.354
Yeah, you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22188-0
03:20:36.194 --> 03:20:40.224
Know anything sort of set rules where
you're actually in the office that day or

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22188-1
03:20:40.224 --> 03:20:42.995
you know, but then. But as you said,
it's low volumes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22188-2
03:20:42.995 --> 03:20:46.924
We've got at least starting framework
that you can get insights from and then

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22188-3
03:20:46.924 --> 03:20:49.594
you could start to look at process
changes based on.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22196-0
03:20:50.604 --> 03:20:50.724
You.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22197-0
03:20:50.724 --> 03:20:51.804
Know the dashboard.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22195-0
03:20:51.714 --> 03:20:51.954
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22198-0
03:20:51.804 --> 03:20:52.564
Or the report.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22214-0
03:20:54.594 --> 03:20:58.253
OK, that's good's umm,
can we just do the tqi month?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22214-1
03:20:58.253 --> 03:21:00.394
We've done manage room booking?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22226-0
03:21:02.644 --> 03:21:04.284
Is there anything else?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22227-0
03:21:04.844 --> 03:21:05.044
We.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22228-0
03:21:05.044 --> 03:21:07.644
Might transport,
we've done manage booking.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22247-0
03:21:09.724 --> 03:21:12.745
I just wanted to teach you.
I'm a recommendation to go into a set of

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22247-1
03:21:12.745 --> 03:21:13.884
services that's available.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22248-0
03:21:12.904 --> 03:21:14.984
He's just the economic stuff.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22290-0
03:21:17.474 --> 03:21:20.995
Yeah.
So then it's the ergonomic well-being and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22290-1
03:21:20.995 --> 03:21:24.076
safety.
So I just want to see that you do

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22290-2
03:21:24.076 --> 03:21:29.725
ergonomic assessments or allowance
history. General crews. Help them see it,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22290-3
03:21:29.725 --> 03:21:34.714
and then there's some new joints and the
new and expectant mothers.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22312-0
03:21:35.554 --> 03:21:36.554
Of course.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22313-0
03:21:37.194 --> 03:21:41.517
So I thought, do they fall under? I mean,
it was a interesting reading the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22313-1
03:21:41.517 --> 03:21:45.034
processes I thought I put them under
managing the workspace.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22319-0
03:21:46.184 --> 03:21:47.704
You know well-being and safety.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22320-0
03:21:48.144 --> 03:21:48.864
Yeah. So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22330-0
03:21:51.714 --> 03:21:56.514
Ask connect. See because I was thinking.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22357-0
03:21:59.394 --> 03:21:59.754
Is new.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22358-0
03:22:00.154 --> 03:22:01.154
Join us to help them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22359-0
03:22:01.674 --> 03:22:03.314
With equipment we're working from home.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22360-0
03:22:04.354 --> 03:22:04.954
So they'll ah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22361-0
03:22:05.954 --> 03:22:11.594
OK. We're at home assessments. Yes, right.
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22386-0
03:22:12.024 --> 03:22:13.224
And so the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22387-0
03:22:13.344 --> 03:22:17.362
Schedule task which is the Joiner's
report, joiners, labels,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22387-1
03:22:17.362 --> 03:22:22.829
labels and which is a scheduled task and
which we would send an e-mail link to the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22387-2
03:22:22.829 --> 03:22:25.464
appropriate person to make the contract.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22396-0
03:22:27.004 --> 03:22:27.244
The.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22397-0
03:22:27.244 --> 03:22:28.884
Link to do the assessment for.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22401-0
03:22:31.004 --> 03:22:31.604
What people might.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22420-0
03:22:32.594 --> 03:22:36.920
And obviously on the back of that we get
feeds. So these can be divested,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22420-1
03:22:36.920 --> 03:22:38.674
can be purchased, this can be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22430-0
03:22:40.994 --> 03:22:41.954
Have this, have that, etc.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22441-0
03:22:41.284 --> 03:22:46.092
Because there is standard set that you
can write so that could be formalised

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22436-0
03:22:43.954 --> 03:22:44.674
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22441-1
03:22:46.092 --> 03:22:46.404
that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22457-0
03:22:46.394 --> 03:22:50.809
So that's kind of knowledge articles.
I put all that in. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22450-0
03:22:48.664 --> 03:22:49.944
Yeah. Oh, great potential.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22457-1
03:22:50.809 --> 03:22:54.594
So lots of queries. Can we buy this?
Can we buy that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22488-0
03:22:56.194 --> 03:22:56.834
Wells so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22489-0
03:22:56.834 --> 03:22:58.794
That's all pre set. So what they can do?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22490-0
03:22:59.634 --> 03:22:59.994
Report.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22491-0
03:22:59.994 --> 03:23:03.347
And then basically all basically have an
outcome of what they should be

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22491-1
03:23:03.347 --> 03:23:05.815
recommended,
but then sometimes they'll come back to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22491-2
03:23:05.815 --> 03:23:06.514
us and ask can.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22492-0
03:23:06.514 --> 03:23:07.354
I get this. Can I get that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22528-0
03:23:07.934 --> 03:23:12.271
OK, so the standard set, so when they,
I mean we'll link with Hannah who did the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22528-1
03:23:12.271 --> 03:23:15.591
HR move the need this process.
So this could be incorporated.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22528-2
03:23:15.591 --> 03:23:19.768
So it's triggered that you don't say
you're already getting this productivity

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22528-3
03:23:19.768 --> 03:23:21.214
that that's been triggered.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22547-0
03:23:22.284 --> 03:23:24.588
That they need.
I don't know whether it's graded or

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22547-1
03:23:24.588 --> 03:23:26.582
banded,
but you know when you're this grade,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22547-2
03:23:26.582 --> 03:23:28.044
you can have a chair and a dance.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22563-0
03:23:30.084 --> 03:23:38.164
And the only objection to being is your
contract. So unless your if you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22565-0
03:23:36.634 --> 03:23:37.114
If.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22564-0
03:23:38.164 --> 03:23:39.444
Are on contracts so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22566-0
03:23:38.314 --> 03:23:38.594
All.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22572-0
03:23:41.514 --> 03:23:42.834
Like you guys, you guys will come in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22589-0
03:23:43.744 --> 03:23:48.811
You guys have you have a party worker,
so that would be another report and we

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22589-1
03:23:48.811 --> 03:23:52.384
obviously it's evening,
November we don't send emails.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22616-0
03:23:53.404 --> 03:23:58.804
S yeah,
and you must be entitled to the £250.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22617-0
03:23:59.244 --> 03:24:01.524
Yeah,
but we're still triggered as part in the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22619-0
03:24:01.524 --> 03:24:04.204
Head count? Yes, actually on fusion.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22635-0
03:24:03.244 --> 03:24:05.044
Question. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22636-0
03:24:05.084 --> 03:24:09.124
Design your headcount will be everybody.
The portfolio of everybody that's working.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22624-0
03:24:05.884 --> 03:24:06.084
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22649-0
03:24:07.804 --> 03:24:12.222
Yeah. So we did we take the report down.
So we've manually out to out.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22639-0
03:24:10.674 --> 03:24:10.834
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22649-1
03:24:12.222 --> 03:24:14.524
So we'll remove like work experience.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22655-0
03:24:16.284 --> 03:24:17.164
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22683-0
03:24:17.934 --> 03:24:20.574
What was the first one you remove
experience so?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22672-0
03:24:20.324 --> 03:24:21.284
Working.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22684-0
03:24:20.854 --> 03:24:23.414
There's, there's quite a few, actually,
so we'll probably need to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22685-0
03:24:23.414 --> 03:24:24.454
Have a look to see.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22686-0
03:24:25.174 --> 03:24:27.414
Interns work years.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22695-0
03:24:26.964 --> 03:24:32.404
Yeah, I know those other in Germany,
I'm sorry.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22698-0
03:24:32.124 --> 03:24:33.084
And nor did.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22705-0
03:24:34.444 --> 03:24:35.604
Or something is that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22706-0
03:24:35.724 --> 03:24:37.204
I have no idea, OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22725-0
03:24:40.684 --> 03:24:45.404
As well. So it's it's like global,
it's a global task. So we sort of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22772-0
03:24:45.004 --> 03:24:48.380
Sure. OK.
So in part we've touched base with Hannah

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22772-1
03:24:48.380 --> 03:24:52.470
and HR's face of that,
that standardised list that we probably

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22772-2
03:24:52.470 --> 03:24:57.533
have a checklist, yes. And then they come.
So they know up front what they're

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22772-3
03:24:57.533 --> 03:25:00.974
entitled to.
So how do the queries get formed or why

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22772-4
03:25:00.974 --> 03:25:05.324
are they asking for certain things if
they know what they can get?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22781-0
03:25:05.744 --> 03:25:08.264
How to?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22815-0
03:25:05.824 --> 03:25:07.504
Out of the queries come about today.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22816-0
03:25:07.664 --> 03:25:15.824
So literally can I get a photos and home
disc even though it's these 250,000?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22817-0
03:25:15.984 --> 03:25:20.904
OK, so we can stop that off of the path.
Yes. Yeah. So that's so. Do you get it?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22817-1
03:25:20.904 --> 03:25:23.698
I mean,
I have two deaf children that are now

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22817-2
03:25:23.698 --> 03:25:24.184
working.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22855-0
03:25:25.074 --> 03:25:27.892
They work remotely,
so they might have an additional

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22855-1
03:25:27.892 --> 03:25:32.041
assessment that you might need for your
special needs. You know, for example,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22855-2
03:25:32.041 --> 03:25:36.295
a loop, not that they want, you know,
the house can't be made into a whole loop

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22849-0
03:25:34.364 --> 03:25:36.124
I want you to have.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22855-3
03:25:36.295 --> 03:25:39.114
system, but fortune.
But there might be speakers or.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22871-0
03:25:40.234 --> 03:25:43.854
You know,
like teams doesn't necessarily work very

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22871-1
03:25:43.854 --> 03:25:45.274
well with equipment.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22875-0
03:25:46.204 --> 03:25:47.444
Essentially passed.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22879-0
03:25:49.004 --> 03:25:49.044
The.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22880-0
03:25:49.474 --> 03:25:50.034
Right.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22908-0
03:25:51.244 --> 03:25:56.738
But HR would know that disability,
so part of your disability triggers. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22902-0
03:25:52.914 --> 03:25:56.080
They should, yeah.
And so should the health and safety

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22902-1
03:25:56.080 --> 03:25:56.714
management.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22908-1
03:25:56.738 --> 03:25:57.724
OK. Thank you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22914-0
03:25:57.914 --> 03:26:00.234
Part of onboarding.
There's a workplace adjustment. Passports.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22916-0
03:26:00.544 --> 03:26:00.944
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22961-0
03:26:01.794 --> 03:26:01.954
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22962-0
03:26:02.474 --> 03:26:03.994
So they'll get that quite early on in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22963-0
03:26:03.994 --> 03:26:08.135
Their onboarding and so they can fill
that out and they send that back to ask

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22963-1
03:26:08.135 --> 03:26:09.994
upon them, ask people to send that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22964-0
03:26:09.994 --> 03:26:13.115
One too,
but it sounds like this is something that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22964-1
03:26:13.115 --> 03:26:16.970
can be headed off at the pass through
these join us, you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22964-2
03:26:16.970 --> 03:26:19.234
maybe it changes over time that they.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22991-0
03:26:20.074 --> 03:26:22.626
You know,
maybe they have an accident or something

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22991-1
03:26:22.626 --> 03:26:26.130
that it still comes in under the
workplace adjustment form because it

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/22991-2
03:26:26.130 --> 03:26:30.234
sounds like you're just picking up the
queries that you might have to say no, no.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23001-0
03:26:30.984 --> 03:26:31.744
No, no.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23019-0
03:26:32.824 --> 03:26:37.472
We can't access the system and so because
we use. What? Right?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23042-0
03:26:37.194 --> 03:26:40.554
Right, yes, because the workplace.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23019-1
03:26:37.472 --> 03:26:39.464
So if we can't access that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23043-0
03:26:40.554 --> 03:26:42.914
Adjustment passport and work rate.
They are separate because.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23045-0
03:26:42.914 --> 03:26:43.714
You're like the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23046-0
03:26:43.714 --> 03:26:48.314
Work adjusted passport is basically right
at the start of on boarding to find out.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23047-0
03:26:48.584 --> 03:26:50.184
What's your name?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23075-0
03:26:49.914 --> 03:26:53.198
So obviously up to the person to send
that back and they ask you to we'll do

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23075-1
03:26:53.198 --> 03:26:55.714
what they need to do with it.
But when is it you get that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23076-0
03:26:55.714 --> 03:26:56.434
Report and when?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23077-0
03:26:56.434 --> 03:26:59.314
Do you send it out? Do you know?
It's like a link.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23105-0
03:27:01.314 --> 03:27:04.434
The last 10 days of the showers we get.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23098-0
03:27:03.344 --> 03:27:08.504
Yeah. What's the export? Consistent.
Who's going out the neighbours?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23106-0
03:27:04.954 --> 03:27:06.314
The system so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23107-0
03:27:06.754 --> 03:27:10.674
There's levers I said,
so I think it's in HR online that send it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23108-0
03:27:11.214 --> 03:27:11.614
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23136-0
03:27:12.604 --> 03:27:14.644
I'm forgetting that yours were at the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23137-0
03:27:14.644 --> 03:27:15.804
People, ones I've just.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23138-0
03:27:16.564 --> 03:27:16.844
Typed.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23122-0
03:27:16.654 --> 03:27:17.294
Yeah, that's fine.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23139-0
03:27:17.124 --> 03:27:18.484
So Nicky was in some of them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23141-0
03:27:18.884 --> 03:27:19.204
So I think.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23142-0
03:27:19.204 --> 03:27:21.804
It's her team that basically it's like an
automated.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23163-0
03:27:21.964 --> 03:27:25.524
Mm-hmm. For that comes over fusion.
That includes joiners and leavers.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23164-0
03:27:25.524 --> 03:27:26.204
For like that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23165-0
03:27:26.204 --> 03:27:29.365
Week etcetera.
So that's comes to you guys.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23165-1
03:27:29.365 --> 03:27:33.244
And then that same when you send the
links out, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23184-0
03:27:34.794 --> 03:27:37.194
And you can say we because we're TQ Y.
So we're link with.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23178-0
03:27:36.394 --> 03:27:36.714
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23185-0
03:27:37.194 --> 03:27:37.474
The.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23186-0
03:27:37.994 --> 03:27:39.714
Team anyway, that will be picked up.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23180-0
03:27:39.470 --> 03:27:39.670
<v Mark Sedge>You.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23197-0
03:27:40.204 --> 03:27:44.355
That's, you know,
the in that's where it's triggered. Sorry,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23197-1
03:27:44.355 --> 03:27:46.124
Mark, you're going to say.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23198-0
03:27:46.310 --> 03:27:48.579
<v Mark Sedge>No,
I was just going to say we'd look what we</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23198-1
03:27:48.579 --> 03:27:52.476
<v Mark Sedge>would do is take that away and logically
join it up so that you'd either get a</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23198-2
03:27:52.476 --> 03:27:55.880
<v Mark Sedge>task or you'd get, you know,
the appropriate mechanism to be able to</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23198-3
03:27:55.880 --> 03:27:56.670
<v Mark Sedge>answer. So yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23238-0
03:27:57.454 --> 03:28:01.491
At this at this point,
this sounds like at the moment it's

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23238-1
03:28:01.491 --> 03:28:05.596
picked up by joiners.
You know in the workplace assessment.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23238-2
03:28:05.596 --> 03:28:10.934
So at this point we've got no queries,
it's the bit where we can head off how

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23238-3
03:28:10.934 --> 03:28:13.534
they then say actually I need so work.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23269-0
03:28:14.714 --> 03:28:17.936
Right.
Is that's a system that they then say

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23269-1
03:28:17.936 --> 03:28:21.086
what that that lays out their
entitlements,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23269-2
03:28:21.086 --> 03:28:23.234
is that right or we have that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23262-0
03:28:22.764 --> 03:28:23.324
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23270-0
03:28:23.754 --> 03:28:26.034
It's it's the e-mail templates that we
send out.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23271-0
03:28:26.394 --> 03:28:26.674
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23277-0
03:28:27.294 --> 03:28:28.134
Will you join us?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23283-0
03:28:30.264 --> 03:28:31.864
And that that's why I work, right?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23304-0
03:28:31.994 --> 03:28:35.713
Yeah. So the template,
so the process is we would send like to

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23304-1
03:28:35.713 --> 03:28:39.314
the appropriate people on the new Jordans
form. Yeah, maybe.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23308-0
03:28:41.474 --> 03:28:43.314
The issues raised.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23316-0
03:28:44.954 --> 03:28:47.354
Would be notified on the work break
system to say.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23343-0
03:28:49.194 --> 03:28:53.873
Shiondrano has five issues.
We would then go to these issues and say,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23343-1
03:28:53.873 --> 03:28:57.082
OK, so she's she's not any.
We also have chair.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23343-2
03:28:57.082 --> 03:28:59.154
She's not got appropriate days.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23374-0
03:28:59.624 --> 03:29:05.502
So we would say without a template and it
would be either a chair of text template

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23374-1
03:29:05.502 --> 03:29:10.744
or it can't be manually sent out template
to say you're entitled to that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23387-0
03:29:12.554 --> 03:29:16.754
Here is the features and and that's how
it's done.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23389-0
03:29:16.594 --> 03:29:17.994
OK, so when you join umm.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23432-0
03:29:20.084 --> 03:29:22.409
Yeah.
Then you get that workplace assessment

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23432-1
03:29:22.409 --> 03:29:25.044
form is triggered for everybody.
Is that why it's?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23410-0
03:29:25.064 --> 03:29:25.704
Did they say?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23433-0
03:29:25.964 --> 03:29:27.164
Sent out by us.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23434-0
03:29:28.004 --> 03:29:30.084
OK. But it could be that when you join.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23435-0
03:29:30.084 --> 03:29:31.004
You could be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23436-0
03:29:31.404 --> 03:29:35.324
On part of your onboarding, you know,
tell us about your set up at home.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23441-0
03:29:35.524 --> 03:29:36.324
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23458-0
03:29:36.114 --> 03:29:36.874
You know, I, you know your.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23459-0
03:29:36.874 --> 03:29:38.874
Chair your desk so that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23460-0
03:29:38.874 --> 03:29:42.514
You're ergonomically what you need,
not working from the bed.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23463-0
03:29:40.630 --> 03:29:45.929
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah. With this, Deborah, we should,
we should join up with Hannah on this one</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23461-0
03:29:40.844 --> 03:29:42.924
Yeah, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23463-1
03:29:45.929 --> 03:29:49.685
<v Mark Sedge>just but yeah,
because I think there's a load of things</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23462-0
03:29:46.554 --> 03:29:46.874
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23463-2
03:29:49.685 --> 03:29:51.430
<v Mark Sedge>that we can just automate.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23497-0
03:29:52.184 --> 03:29:53.424
Exactly. So you're not even.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23471-0
03:29:54.074 --> 03:29:54.954
At this point I haven't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23498-0
03:29:55.184 --> 03:29:59.440
I'm saying Mark is it's Only Connect get
the I'm trying to work out.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23498-1
03:29:59.440 --> 03:30:02.524
How do you then get the push back of the
queries?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23498-2
03:30:02.524 --> 03:30:05.424
Because if we handle it through HR
onboarding.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23553-0
03:30:06.994 --> 03:30:11.591
You're only the queries are then coming
to you and it's that bit of that that I'm

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23553-1
03:30:11.591 --> 03:30:15.180
trying to probably get to as if it was
handled by the up front.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23553-2
03:30:15.180 --> 03:30:19.834
It might be that this process goes away
from. It's opposite, you know, goes, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23554-0
03:30:19.834 --> 03:30:23.590
I think there's a there's a lot of tasks
that as people do like post join into,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23554-1
03:30:23.590 --> 03:30:25.234
like D1, etcetera. I don't see why.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23555-0
03:30:25.234 --> 03:30:25.834
That couldn't be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23556-0
03:30:25.834 --> 03:30:26.874
One of them, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23564-0
03:30:27.664 --> 03:30:30.464
Just deal with it.
Is this been a discussion before or?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23593-0
03:30:30.244 --> 03:30:30.764
Did you know?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23594-0
03:30:31.084 --> 03:30:35.100
It's it's the point where because we
manually add them on, we work right?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23594-1
03:30:35.100 --> 03:30:39.279
I don't know what we can automatically
add them because it's like a process.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23594-2
03:30:39.279 --> 03:30:41.124
It's like we need to like, follow.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23605-0
03:30:41.454 --> 03:30:44.492
Yeah, yeah,
I probably don't know what enough of what,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23605-1
03:30:44.492 --> 03:30:46.094
what tasks is it doing today?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23616-0
03:30:47.634 --> 03:30:50.954
Actual service hours not going to,
you know, make obsolete.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23633-0
03:30:54.594 --> 03:30:57.834
On that probably is your unique like to
access and then you can track those.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23633-1
03:30:57.834 --> 03:30:58.634
They've done it on.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23634-0
03:30:59.434 --> 03:30:59.794
Even.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23632-0
03:30:59.910 --> 03:31:00.710
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, that like.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23664-0
03:31:00.954 --> 03:31:03.354
Services. Now that's no. Yeah, you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23640-0
03:31:02.004 --> 03:31:02.244
That's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23665-0
03:31:03.354 --> 03:31:03.874
Know as our.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23666-0
03:31:03.874 --> 03:31:07.292
Post joining task and D exactly the add
them to work right.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23666-1
03:31:07.292 --> 03:31:10.882
It's generates that e-mail.
They go in and do their work right

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23666-2
03:31:10.882 --> 03:31:11.794
assessment? Yep.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23698-0
03:31:12.244 --> 03:31:12.804
Good, I think.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23699-0
03:31:12.844 --> 03:31:15.737
I think HR,
if I'm writing to this week and I think

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23699-1
03:31:15.737 --> 03:31:20.077
HR do it in Australia and there was a
there was a question about whether that

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23699-2
03:31:20.077 --> 03:31:21.524
should actually jump over.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23741-0
03:31:23.484 --> 03:31:24.204
For consistency, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23742-0
03:31:24.364 --> 03:31:27.836
I'm not always,
but he's he's an AC problem with the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23702-0
03:31:24.830 --> 03:31:25.070
<v Mark Sedge>It's.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23742-1
03:31:27.836 --> 03:31:31.964
chair. It's not ours. It's not your job.
It's obviously, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23743-0
03:31:32.284 --> 03:31:32.764
So I'm just.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23744-0
03:31:32.764 --> 03:31:33.244
Thinking that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23730-0
03:31:33.474 --> 03:31:34.234
It's a creative.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23745-0
03:31:34.044 --> 03:31:37.261
It could be that it could be these
activities become obsolete for you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23745-1
03:31:37.261 --> 03:31:39.284
because it's already it's handled up
front.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23755-0
03:31:39.204 --> 03:31:42.004
Yes,
I'm sure we'll be changing places from us.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23754-0
03:31:40.864 --> 03:31:41.544
Because.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23794-0
03:31:43.084 --> 03:31:47.083
You're almost triggering the process and
then from that getting the queries,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23794-1
03:31:47.083 --> 03:31:50.355
but if it's handled up front that all
that ergonomic you know,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23770-0
03:31:49.630 --> 03:31:49.790
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23794-2
03:31:50.355 --> 03:31:54.146
I've got a product desk has signed off,
and then the knowledge articles.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23794-3
03:31:54.146 --> 03:31:57.989
This is what you're entitled to,
because do you then if they do land with

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23794-4
03:31:57.989 --> 03:31:58.924
you today, do you?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23815-0
03:32:00.084 --> 03:32:03.292
Who do you assign it to to do the to make
sure they get their chair there.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23815-1
03:32:03.292 --> 03:32:05.004
Who then orders all that stuff for them?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23823-0
03:32:04.614 --> 03:32:04.894
That's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23824-0
03:32:05.214 --> 03:32:08.374
Nice up today something so we basically
template, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23825-0
03:32:08.454 --> 03:32:09.214
They would say.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23826-0
03:32:08.590 --> 03:32:09.630
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, this this.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23831-0
03:32:10.454 --> 03:32:12.774
This sounds like it's gonna process.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23834-0
03:32:12.190 --> 03:32:14.458
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, because this, Deborah,
this lines up.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23834-1
03:32:14.458 --> 03:32:18.582
<v Mark Sedge>I was in one of those sessions where they
were talking about ergonomic mice and</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23834-2
03:32:18.582 --> 03:32:22.705
<v Mark Sedge>ergonomic keyboards and things like that,
and the areas just tend to, you know,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23834-3
03:32:22.705 --> 03:32:26.108
<v Mark Sedge>just tend to buy them. Like,
because I was expecting IT to manage</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23834-4
03:32:26.108 --> 03:32:29.407
<v Mark Sedge>those. So that if you,
if you had an ergonomic keyboard and you</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23834-5
03:32:29.407 --> 03:32:31.830
<v Mark Sedge>needed a replacement because it failed,
you'd.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23835-0
03:32:31.950 --> 03:32:35.234
<v Mark Sedge>Get the equivalent one and they'd manage
it and control it,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23835-1
03:32:35.234 --> 03:32:38.355
<v Mark Sedge>but it's all a bit local,
but the point is the triggers.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23835-2
03:32:38.355 --> 03:32:42.789
<v Mark Sedge>If the triggers and then the activities
and if the things that they've got to do</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23835-3
03:32:42.789 --> 03:32:45.800
<v Mark Sedge>themselves to arrange,
the ordering thereof, etcetera,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23835-4
03:32:45.800 --> 03:32:46.950
<v Mark Sedge>is all in their gift.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23838-0
03:32:47.390 --> 03:32:50.990
<v Mark Sedge>It feels like we should.
We should just align the process and get</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23838-1
03:32:50.990 --> 03:32:53.390
<v Mark Sedge>it started in the right place without
your.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23880-0
03:32:54.594 --> 03:32:59.094
You're involved with that fine with
Hannah on the that side and we can get

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23839-0
03:32:54.990 --> 03:32:55.350
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23847-0
03:32:55.334 --> 03:32:55.734
Hey Cortana.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23880-1
03:32:59.094 --> 03:33:00.474
this kicked kicked off.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23857-0
03:33:00.774 --> 03:33:01.414
And it could be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23881-0
03:33:01.234 --> 03:33:03.034
Be that as a general, sorry.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23882-0
03:33:03.154 --> 03:33:03.994
What is the?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23864-0
03:33:03.310 --> 03:33:05.110
<v Mark Sedge>It may be a, sorry.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23883-0
03:33:04.714 --> 03:33:06.822
Logic of guys having people to work.
Craig,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23883-1
03:33:06.822 --> 03:33:09.554
do you do other things with that system
apart from this?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23889-0
03:33:10.534 --> 03:33:11.414
No, we.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23903-0
03:33:13.674 --> 03:33:20.074
And actually the the health,
the new expected mother's that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23895-0
03:33:16.024 --> 03:33:16.504
Issues.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23911-0
03:33:21.234 --> 03:33:23.074
Added for you.
You can still manage those issues.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23920-0
03:33:23.264 --> 03:33:27.264
Yeah, yeah. So it could be will link up.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23956-0
03:33:29.444 --> 03:33:32.444
And then that's when we send it the same
thing. OK,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23956-1
03:33:32.444 --> 03:33:37.003
so you've completed the assessment and
it's highlighted the problems we've got

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23956-2
03:33:37.003 --> 03:33:41.677
and then we check in a daily basis and
then send out the appropriate form to say

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24006-0
03:33:41.464 --> 03:33:41.784
Sure.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/23956-3
03:33:41.677 --> 03:33:43.524
you can buy something like that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24007-0
03:33:42.744 --> 03:33:45.467
Yeah.
And if you just so it sounds like we'll

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24007-1
03:33:45.467 --> 03:33:49.255
pick that up with HR set,
the trigger might not even touch you,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24007-2
03:33:49.255 --> 03:33:52.156
but I think there is that ongoing is now
broken.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24007-3
03:33:52.156 --> 03:33:56.003
I have an issue whether that's picked up
as the a general query.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24007-4
03:33:56.003 --> 03:34:00.798
You know I've got mark with your stuff.
It's like I've got an issue now and then

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24007-5
03:34:00.798 --> 03:34:01.864
it feeds into the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24005-0
03:34:01.590 --> 03:34:01.910
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24023-0
03:34:02.954 --> 03:34:06.030
Language when it's broken,
all my chairs broken.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24023-1
03:34:06.030 --> 03:34:07.474
My wheels have sort of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24040-0
03:34:07.794 --> 03:34:11.494
Probably get back to eyes.
So we bought it for home and then they

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24040-1
03:34:11.494 --> 03:34:14.914
came back through six months later to see
my chair's broken.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24052-0
03:34:17.004 --> 03:34:20.964
That's a knowledge article in its making,
so it doesn't need.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24047-0
03:34:20.390 --> 03:34:20.750
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24058-0
03:34:21.464 --> 03:34:23.304
The question I have, and I had this.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24073-0
03:34:25.874 --> 03:34:30.156
Teaching this process right?
So the question that I have is really

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24073-1
03:34:30.156 --> 03:34:32.394
everybody's entitled to this money.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24081-0
03:34:34.474 --> 03:34:35.914
I don't get why we need.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24082-0
03:34:36.594 --> 03:34:36.674
To.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24121-0
03:34:39.564 --> 03:34:44.639
What I'm saying is you would only be
notified that you're entitled to have you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24121-1
03:34:44.639 --> 03:34:49.778
just started? Yeah, I'm just started.
And you felt on you've done the training,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24121-2
03:34:49.778 --> 03:34:54.404
but it's not highlighted an issue you
wouldn't. You know, you wouldn't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24176-0
03:34:54.844 --> 03:34:58.201
The Ashfalls gave you £250 to be part of
that entitlement.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24176-1
03:34:58.201 --> 03:35:01.444
That is your onboard team.
I've joined our chef because.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24148-0
03:35:01.564 --> 03:35:02.684
Set up my room.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24177-0
03:35:01.764 --> 03:35:01.924
They.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24178-0
03:35:03.004 --> 03:35:07.084
I start the I start my working life as it
should be, because if I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24179-0
03:35:07.084 --> 03:35:11.120
Was in the office. Yes, yes.
Obviously we're looking at from the start.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24179-1
03:35:11.120 --> 03:35:15.324
Everybody should be entitled to it,
depending on what tracks, as I say so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24191-0
03:35:15.694 --> 03:35:18.636
And so it's not a cost issue,
it's just that it's not,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24180-0
03:35:16.550 --> 03:35:16.670
<v Mark Sedge>To uh.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24191-1
03:35:18.636 --> 03:35:20.294
I mean it's available for them.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24193-0
03:35:20.670 --> 03:35:23.828
<v Mark Sedge>So this is one of those that as part of
the HR,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24193-1
03:35:23.828 --> 03:35:28.895
<v Mark Sedge>so the whole onboarding piece there could
be a whole suite of documentation,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24193-2
03:35:28.895 --> 03:35:33.764
<v Mark Sedge>entitlement information that just is a
trigger point that either somebody</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24193-3
03:35:33.764 --> 03:35:38.831
<v Mark Sedge>launches or at certain phase when they've
onboarded say they've gone through</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24193-4
03:35:38.831 --> 03:35:39.950
<v Mark Sedge>certain criteria.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24197-0
03:35:40.070 --> 03:35:45.118
<v Mark Sedge>There's an auto task that just sends that
documentation straight out to them</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24196-0
03:35:45.034 --> 03:35:46.074
Would it? I mean we've got.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24197-1
03:35:45.118 --> 03:35:48.527
<v Mark Sedge>without, you know,
including the form including it,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24197-2
03:35:48.527 --> 03:35:52.133
<v Mark Sedge>potentially the form,
so they you could almost do that</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24197-3
03:35:52.133 --> 03:35:56.526
<v Mark Sedge>something where if they,
if they've got some findings and you have</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24197-4
03:35:56.526 --> 03:35:59.870
<v Mark Sedge>a tick,
if they come back with certain tick boxes.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24199-0
03:35:59.990 --> 03:36:02.653
<v Mark Sedge>You could almost see get the system to
look at those,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24199-1
03:36:02.653 --> 03:36:06.253
<v Mark Sedge>what they've ticked and then send the
appropriate form without any human</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24199-2
03:36:06.253 --> 03:36:07.190
<v Mark Sedge>involvement at all.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24242-0
03:36:08.944 --> 03:36:12.632
I was going to say that, you know,
say for example your two new junior

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24242-1
03:36:12.632 --> 03:36:15.281
associates,
you know you started and one found out

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24242-2
03:36:15.281 --> 03:36:19.540
they could spend 250 and over coffee or
next meetings that the other person found

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24242-3
03:36:19.540 --> 03:36:22.605
out they didn't get. You know,
it's almost setting a tone,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24242-4
03:36:22.605 --> 03:36:23.904
isn't it that why wasn't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24292-0
03:36:25.154 --> 03:36:27.761
Actually, if it's if,
it's when you get your laptop they get.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24292-1
03:36:27.761 --> 03:36:30.830
I mean the excitement of I've got this,
I've got, I've got my new chair,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24270-0
03:36:30.524 --> 03:36:32.924
And if there's a place.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24292-2
03:36:30.830 --> 03:36:34.194
I've got my new setup, I'm ready to go.
It's a nice. It's a nice reputation of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24293-0
03:36:34.194 --> 03:36:37.980
Thing because join an e-mail,
it's seen out to every new joiner and it

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24293-1
03:36:37.980 --> 03:36:39.154
starts it. It differs.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24294-0
03:36:39.154 --> 03:36:41.194
If it's like Glasgow, London, whatever.
But.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24322-0
03:36:41.654 --> 03:36:44.624
I don't think it does any harm.
Putting information in there about that,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24322-1
03:36:44.624 --> 03:36:46.414
you know the amount etcetera,
because that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24323-0
03:36:46.494 --> 03:36:50.965
Charge would be is this?
This was a relatively new process in

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24323-1
03:36:50.965 --> 03:36:51.614
terms of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24326-0
03:36:54.154 --> 03:36:54.634
Because COVID.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24330-0
03:36:55.124 --> 03:36:55.364
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24337-0
03:36:56.514 --> 03:36:59.634
So this is only this process we need to
go.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24376-0
03:37:02.514 --> 03:37:04.314
And so relatively new process.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24346-0
03:37:04.214 --> 03:37:04.494
Right.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24377-0
03:37:04.474 --> 03:37:08.335
But also is that you want people,
presumably you're still setting the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24377-1
03:37:08.335 --> 03:37:11.314
standard that you work hard at home.
I mean it's not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24364-0
03:37:11.144 --> 03:37:11.624
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24378-0
03:37:11.634 --> 03:37:15.480
And we want you, we can increase your.
I mean we can increase the amount of time

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24367-0
03:37:13.724 --> 03:37:13.884
I think.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24378-1
03:37:15.480 --> 03:37:17.474
you're working because you're comfortable.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24388-0
03:37:18.434 --> 03:37:20.914
Is an advantage, so why not comes back?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24429-0
03:37:21.154 --> 03:37:24.339
Yeah.
The only thing that I can think of is why

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24429-1
03:37:24.339 --> 03:37:28.587
they don't do it as standards.
That costs money on what? Right.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24429-2
03:37:28.587 --> 03:37:33.034
So for each person's added,
it costs money. So for a licence, I'm.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24430-0
03:37:33.754 --> 03:37:39.154
Trying to work out what would work,
how how work like what is work right Siri.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24448-0
03:37:39.984 --> 03:37:42.064
It's been it's getting to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24449-0
03:37:42.224 --> 03:37:44.304
It's the training,
it's the learning and developing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24450-0
03:37:44.384 --> 03:37:45.584
Platform to walk through.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24452-0
03:37:45.230 --> 03:37:47.676
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
but you could possibly do that through</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24452-1
03:37:47.676 --> 03:37:51.156
<v Mark Sedge>knowledge. You see, if we're,
we could probably do that through</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24452-2
03:37:51.156 --> 03:37:53.712
<v Mark Sedge>knowledge.
You could have a video through your</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24452-3
03:37:53.712 --> 03:37:57.518
<v Mark Sedge>knowledge articles in ServiceNow
potentially without the need to even</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24452-4
03:37:57.518 --> 03:38:01.922
<v Mark Sedge>utilise that service unless you're doing
a unless you're catching and certifying</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24452-5
03:38:01.922 --> 03:38:04.750
<v Mark Sedge>that they've done the training or they've
gone out.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24455-0
03:38:06.230 --> 03:38:10.390
<v Mark Sedge>It it might be something to just look at
what that is in its entirety.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24490-0
03:38:09.434 --> 03:38:14.155
Is it ongoing getting on your development?
It also suggests other learning

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24490-1
03:38:14.155 --> 03:38:17.114
development.
It's a learning development tool.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24476-0
03:38:14.434 --> 03:38:16.154
That that is weird. That is so weird.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24491-0
03:38:17.394 --> 03:38:21.674
So it's it's modules,
so it's health and safety, so economic.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24492-0
03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:23.070
<v Mark Sedge>OK. So it's LMS.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24496-0
03:38:23.944 --> 03:38:25.304
Yes, yes, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24509-0
03:38:26.854 --> 03:38:27.414
But most of our.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24510-0
03:38:27.414 --> 03:38:29.494
Manager training. We do announce,
don't we?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24508-0
03:38:27.634 --> 03:38:28.874
And then imagine it's just.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24511-0
03:38:29.710 --> 03:38:31.470
<v Mark Sedge>Sorry, yeah, learning management.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24523-0
03:38:31.444 --> 03:38:35.284
Internal like we've got anti bribery
healthy.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24544-0
03:38:35.354 --> 03:38:40.219
The ones that we we only use the 2,
so we only use the agile working home.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24544-1
03:38:40.219 --> 03:38:44.954
I don't know the official name,
so basically that says for working home.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24568-0
03:38:43.554 --> 03:38:46.634
Sure, if you're talking if.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24569-0
03:38:46.634 --> 03:38:51.767
This the new and expected months course.
That's only two that we try to see.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24569-1
03:38:51.767 --> 03:38:53.234
Everything else? Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24572-0
03:38:51.774 --> 03:38:52.654
So there are other ones.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24573-0
03:38:52.654 --> 03:38:53.734
On it. But I don't think.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24623-0
03:38:55.084 --> 03:38:55.484
That's an.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24596-0
03:38:55.314 --> 03:38:55.834
I just don't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24597-0
03:38:55.914 --> 03:38:56.594
Know if they do like a.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24624-0
03:38:56.284 --> 03:38:57.844
Can take directly because I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24598-0
03:38:56.594 --> 03:38:58.754
Knowledge. Yes, I could be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24625-0
03:38:58.444 --> 03:39:02.309
Be getting wrong with what this is but
from when I because I had to renew my not

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24625-1
03:39:02.309 --> 03:39:06.174
wrong and I remember to ask you questions
like are your elbows on the dance like

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24625-2
03:39:06.174 --> 03:39:07.844
does your seat have wheels on that?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24628-0
03:39:10.024 --> 03:39:10.664
Yeah. OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24632-0
03:39:10.564 --> 03:39:13.124
These are several thousand, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24636-0
03:39:16.910 --> 03:39:20.110
<v Mark Sedge>No. You trigger a survey,
you make it like a survey.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24654-0
03:39:21.454 --> 03:39:25.445
In my previous home,
we've set out for our Department of HSE,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24654-1
03:39:25.445 --> 03:39:29.694
it's called like we just got the stuff
from that user SharePoint.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24694-0
03:39:30.144 --> 03:39:33.024
Yep 4 which is the same idea.
So we did it in.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24662-0
03:39:30.194 --> 03:39:31.634
Yeah, we could trigger that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24665-0
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.950
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24695-0
03:39:33.024 --> 03:39:33.264
Time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24673-0
03:39:33.774 --> 03:39:34.014
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24696-0
03:39:33.984 --> 03:39:35.704
Using that information.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24697-0
03:39:36.024 --> 03:39:37.384
I don't the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24698-0
03:39:37.504 --> 03:39:42.384
The process is from a new sket the
manager, so maybe.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24699-0
03:39:42.424 --> 03:39:44.144
We can investigate that of what's on it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24712-0
03:39:44.544 --> 03:39:47.024
See the overlap that we.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24726-0
03:39:46.054 --> 03:39:47.774
It's definitely worth talking about I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24727-0
03:39:47.814 --> 03:39:51.834
Think we can probably do something?
I think it is anuska and will she be in

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24727-1
03:39:51.834 --> 03:39:52.734
the facilities 1?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24738-0
03:39:56.964 --> 03:39:58.700
Did you see my? Oh,
they couldn't man too great,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24738-1
03:39:58.700 --> 03:39:59.764
but they stopped that so much.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24755-0
03:40:00.914 --> 03:40:05.139
And The thing is, see,
once you've had that £250,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24755-1
03:40:05.139 --> 03:40:06.914
you can get it again.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24788-0
03:40:08.694 --> 03:40:11.520
So you, you you have,
you've done this three years now,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24788-1
03:40:11.520 --> 03:40:15.406
you completed it, but three years not all,
but you've already used your £250

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24788-2
03:40:15.406 --> 03:40:17.374
allowance, you're not getting that, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24811-0
03:40:17.274 --> 03:40:22.477
Yeah. And we could certainly pick that.
Why don't we pick that up as a mark and

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24789-0
03:40:17.934 --> 03:40:18.694
Pretty good chair.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24811-1
03:40:22.477 --> 03:40:26.314
just we can start to incorporate what it
actually is work.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24812-0
03:40:26.314 --> 03:40:27.234
By doing it's, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24820-0
03:40:26.674 --> 03:40:29.754
And potentially see the Farman is where
you need.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24819-0
03:40:28.784 --> 03:40:29.424
Working as we all.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24818-0
03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:30.470
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24836-0
03:40:31.104 --> 03:40:31.944
It might, yeah, it might be.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24837-0
03:40:31.944 --> 03:40:33.744
A new different modules, now some of.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24838-0
03:40:33.744 --> 03:40:35.224
The attestation features.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24856-0
03:40:34.914 --> 03:40:36.674
So. So they may not mean but.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24857-0
03:40:36.794 --> 03:40:37.034
But we.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24848-0
03:40:36.984 --> 03:40:37.624
But we can give a check.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24858-0
03:40:37.194 --> 03:40:38.434
Investigate you look.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24859-0
03:40:38.434 --> 03:40:40.354
Interesting. Yeah,
I think it's definitely.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24860-0
03:40:40.354 --> 03:40:41.754
Worth a further conversation.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24861-0
03:40:41.110 --> 03:40:44.663
<v Mark Sedge>But you see something even as even
something as simple as you,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24861-1
03:40:44.663 --> 03:40:48.272
<v Mark Sedge>as part of the onboarding,
when I get to a certain phase of the</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24861-2
03:40:48.272 --> 03:40:51.205
<v Mark Sedge>onboarding,
it sends out a little questionnaire for</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24861-3
03:40:51.205 --> 03:40:55.660
<v Mark Sedge>them to go and they ask those common
questions that any work at work area sort</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24861-4
03:40:55.660 --> 03:40:55.830
<v Mark Sedge>of.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24864-0
03:40:56.590 --> 03:41:00.110
<v Mark Sedge>Assessment. You know,
it might be that you can use some of that</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24864-1
03:41:00.110 --> 03:41:04.180
<v Mark Sedge>to do an initial trigger as to whether
you send any follow up or don't or</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24864-2
03:41:04.180 --> 03:41:07.150
<v Mark Sedge>whatever. Yeah,
there's I think it's worth exploring.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24878-0
03:41:08.234 --> 03:41:11.794
And do they keep? It could be,
as you said, I was on boarding actually.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24902-0
03:41:11.914 --> 03:41:15.602
I've left my last phone. My desk is right,
my chair's great.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24902-1
03:41:15.602 --> 03:41:19.048
I have one before you know my previous.
I spent the 250.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24902-2
03:41:19.048 --> 03:41:22.434
It could be triggered at any time.
So in a year's time.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24924-0
03:41:23.494 --> 03:41:26.086
It could be that you could use that 250
at any point,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24924-1
03:41:26.086 --> 03:41:29.734
so you could trigger the request you at
any point of the process, not just.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24929-0
03:41:29.910 --> 03:41:32.604
<v Mark Sedge>So,
but that's when you'd you'd back that</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24929-1
03:41:32.604 --> 03:41:37.865
<v Mark Sedge>with a knowledge article so it and it'll
be something like if you haven't already</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24928-0
03:41:33.814 --> 03:41:34.094
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24929-2
03:41:37.865 --> 03:41:41.715
<v Mark Sedge>utilised this service,
there's the opportunity to do XYZ or</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24929-3
03:41:41.715 --> 03:41:45.693
<v Mark Sedge>whatever you with it,
but I think the caution here is whether</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24929-4
03:41:45.693 --> 03:41:49.030
<v Mark Sedge>the company wants to actively promote it
or not or.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24932-0
03:41:49.190 --> 03:41:53.935
<v Mark Sedge>Whether it's one of those things that is,
you know, when I have an issue,</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24932-1
03:41:53.935 --> 03:41:57.270
<v Mark Sedge>it then gets you know, it's one of those,
isn't it?</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24946-0
03:41:58.474 --> 03:42:01.954
Actually promoted because they need to
pay for the licences on what?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24947-0
03:42:01.954 --> 03:42:03.914
Right. Yeah, they, they, they.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24957-0
03:42:06.304 --> 03:42:08.744
Mark it probably the licencing, not the,
not the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24959-0
03:42:09.310 --> 03:42:12.627
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah, it's not the 250. No, exactly.
It's not the cost of the chair.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24959-1
03:42:12.627 --> 03:42:14.310
<v Mark Sedge>It will be the cost of the licence.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24982-0
03:42:15.504 --> 03:42:19.944
So doesn't matter they get add licence or
not, they can't come in the form, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24997-0
03:42:18.354 --> 03:42:20.314
Yes, could you do?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24998-0
03:42:20.314 --> 03:42:21.714
That at onboarding.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24983-0
03:42:20.704 --> 03:42:22.104
Yeah, it doesn't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/24999-0
03:42:21.714 --> 03:42:24.354
I think it's a good, good.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25000-0
03:42:24.634 --> 03:42:28.794
Point and if you were so, OK,
you've got somebody that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25006-0
03:42:29.644 --> 03:42:31.884
2250 spell I've got my chair on my desk.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25039-0
03:42:33.644 --> 03:42:36.579
Within their probation period,
if there's no return,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25039-1
03:42:36.579 --> 03:42:40.844
there's no return process or you've left
after a month and we've just spent.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25039-2
03:42:40.844 --> 03:42:42.284
It's just been considered.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25040-0
03:42:41.414 --> 03:42:42.014
It's nothing to.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25041-0
03:42:42.094 --> 03:42:44.734
Ask. OK. OK. Yeah, for you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25067-0
03:42:45.264 --> 03:42:45.344
No.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25046-0
03:42:46.254 --> 03:42:46.894
Aren't eligible.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25068-0
03:42:47.064 --> 03:42:47.584
No, no FTC.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25070-0
03:42:47.584 --> 03:42:50.704
'S up,
so it's going to be against the PDR.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25064-0
03:42:50.094 --> 03:42:52.254
It's not third party. Yeah, no contact.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25071-0
03:42:52.384 --> 03:42:53.064
Actually.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25074-0
03:42:54.254 --> 03:42:54.574
Yeah, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25093-0
03:42:55.424 --> 03:42:58.493
Makes sense.
Policy of Deloitte's around COVID time I

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25093-1
03:42:58.493 --> 03:43:02.925
got the mail that came out and I looked
at the list of what you could get for

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25093-2
03:43:02.925 --> 03:43:04.744
2:15. So the full store in that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25105-0
03:43:11.014 --> 03:43:12.854
Well, do you know?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25106-0
03:43:13.814 --> 03:43:18.294
What we would recommend to you close them,
right?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25111-0
03:43:23.214 --> 03:43:24.334
Yes, because it's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25115-0
03:43:26.344 --> 03:43:27.544
Because we've given one example.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25128-0
03:43:29.234 --> 03:43:33.194
Yeah, close it. And the lamp.
It's not cheaper than a blind, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25156-0
03:43:35.124 --> 03:43:39.550
Just on the topic of work right,
can I just ask about the new and expected

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25156-1
03:43:39.550 --> 03:43:42.441
mothers course,
because I'm just thinking again,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25144-0
03:43:40.594 --> 03:43:40.794
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25156-2
03:43:42.441 --> 03:43:44.684
could this tie in with ask people and?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25159-0
03:43:45.404 --> 03:43:47.164
Was any sense? So it's a 500.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25162-0
03:43:48.014 --> 03:43:49.134
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25181-0
03:43:51.654 --> 03:43:54.694
We're just talking.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25182-0
03:43:55.134 --> 03:44:00.654
About the newly expected mothers course
that's triggered from the parental leave.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25183-0
03:44:00.814 --> 03:44:01.974
Yeah, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25185-0
03:44:04.110 --> 03:44:06.606
<v Mark Sedge>Yeah,
there's a there's a lot of opportunity</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25185-1
03:44:06.606 --> 03:44:07.550
<v Mark Sedge>for join up here.</v>

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25204-0
03:44:08.254 --> 03:44:12.627
Yeah, that's great.
But that worked like 1 I think is worthy

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25204-1
03:44:12.627 --> 03:44:15.854
of,
but we'll join the talk with HR on this.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25212-0
03:44:18.444 --> 03:44:18.924
I'm not seeing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25211-0
03:44:21.184 --> 03:44:21.504
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25219-0
03:44:23.904 --> 03:44:27.304
Thank you. I think that's good.
Happy with that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25221-0
03:44:27.894 --> 03:44:28.574
And use it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25225-0
03:44:31.144 --> 03:44:32.024
Hello. What's?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25231-0
03:44:31.264 --> 03:44:34.544
Balance history. OK,
so that's their allowance, yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25234-0
03:44:35.244 --> 03:44:36.684
Of what they've spent to date.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25254-0
03:44:38.224 --> 03:44:40.911
And issues chair broke will sell off.
As you said,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25254-1
03:44:40.911 --> 03:44:44.864
the knowledge article will be back into
warranty. That's not your ongoing.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25295-0
03:44:46.444 --> 03:44:50.524
Expiration or a cut off date for when
they use that new, that's what.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25296-0
03:44:50.524 --> 03:44:53.644
We're saying if you look that you're.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25271-0
03:44:50.984 --> 03:44:51.784
Sorry I missed.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25298-0
03:44:53.644 --> 03:44:53.764
Not.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25286-0
03:44:53.824 --> 03:44:55.424
I don't think I will leave.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25299-0
03:44:55.484 --> 03:44:59.564
Your for 11 years and I know we've only
had it since COVID, but like what I was.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25287-0
03:44:56.264 --> 03:44:56.984
What's name?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25300-0
03:44:59.564 --> 03:45:00.604
Five years ago or something.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25320-0
03:45:00.114 --> 03:45:03.517
Signal for some purpose he has to use a
little fast. Yeah. If not,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25311-0
03:45:01.414 --> 03:45:01.894
Business.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25320-1
03:45:03.517 --> 03:45:05.194
he can use it will lose it. So I.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25321-0
03:45:05.194 --> 03:45:06.034
Don't know, OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25340-0
03:45:06.164 --> 03:45:06.484
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25341-0
03:45:06.524 --> 03:45:07.604
Just do it anytime.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25327-0
03:45:07.794 --> 03:45:08.514
Yeah, that's Richard.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25342-0
03:45:08.004 --> 03:45:12.604
Three times. Yeah. And what if? Sorry,
I just like it out for a minute.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25377-0
03:45:13.404 --> 03:45:15.484
What if your situation has changed?
So let's say if you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25378-0
03:45:15.484 --> 03:45:15.724
Had a.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25379-0
03:45:15.724 --> 03:45:19.084
Desk you were fine like mail eleven years.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25380-0
03:45:19.324 --> 03:45:20.644
Ago, but you had an accident.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25381-0
03:45:20.644 --> 03:45:24.524
You've acquired a disability. Do you have?
How do you like kink off this process?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25391-0
03:45:24.224 --> 03:45:27.184
That's the workplace assessment.
That's the adjustment, is it?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25409-0
03:45:26.704 --> 03:45:27.984
At all that would come.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25392-0
03:45:27.864 --> 03:45:28.464
Comes through it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25410-0
03:45:28.264 --> 03:45:32.283
It's probably an issue on an e-mail,
so it comes through it as all our general

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25410-1
03:45:32.283 --> 03:45:33.504
period and again that's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25413-0
03:45:33.914 --> 03:45:34.994
Did you pick up this one?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25443-0
03:45:35.624 --> 03:45:37.064
Yeah. So we would kick it off, so.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25444-0
03:45:37.064 --> 03:45:37.704
We would just.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25445-0
03:45:38.224 --> 03:45:42.905
Basically, follow it to so a new schedule.
I haven't seen the manager,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25445-1
03:45:42.905 --> 03:45:47.719
so she would then just see if you have a
medical certificate. Yes, I do.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25445-2
03:45:47.719 --> 03:45:49.104
And then the the the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25481-0
03:45:50.014 --> 03:45:54.094
They are over the desk would come in the
hardware chat fine.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25482-0
03:45:54.374 --> 03:45:56.894
If she had an accident, how did? Sorry.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25483-0
03:45:57.094 --> 03:45:57.934
Or if you required.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25476-0
03:45:57.154 --> 03:46:01.394
OK. Quiet disability. Oh, yes, yes,
I don't.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25484-0
03:45:58.534 --> 03:45:58.894
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25485-0
03:46:01.534 --> 03:46:02.294
Amendments.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25477-0
03:46:01.994 --> 03:46:02.134
Know.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25501-0
03:46:02.244 --> 03:46:07.699
Ruling the process about the workplace
adjustment, but that does fall into place,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25499-0
03:46:06.274 --> 03:46:07.154
But she was like.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25501-1
03:46:07.699 --> 03:46:08.564
I'm thinking.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25537-0
03:46:14.854 --> 03:46:20.173
Someone recently has had an accident and
they filled out like a workplace adjust,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25526-0
03:46:19.474 --> 03:46:20.594
Been supporting the court.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25537-1
03:46:20.173 --> 03:46:22.574
so it must fall into place somewhere.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25538-0
03:46:22.214 --> 03:46:24.294
So some things that it's triggered really
by that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25552-0
03:46:25.054 --> 03:46:27.296
Again,
with that we can have a knowledge article

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25552-1
03:46:27.296 --> 03:46:29.814
somewhere. You know if, yeah.
Circumstances can do it.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25569-0
03:46:27.904 --> 03:46:32.948
Yeah, you know what? It's it's. See,
I'm getting mail mails claimed on the

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25569-1
03:46:32.948 --> 03:46:36.177
screen,
but then she's going to work in Sydney.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25569-2
03:46:36.177 --> 03:46:36.984
She's still.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25575-0
03:46:38.964 --> 03:46:40.204
She's not entitled to the system.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25577-0
03:46:39.424 --> 03:46:41.704
Can you hear me OK?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25611-0
03:46:42.774 --> 03:46:43.054
I said we.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25612-0
03:46:43.054 --> 03:46:46.516
Should do that,
but I suppose as we're we're touching

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25612-1
03:46:46.516 --> 03:46:51.837
base and I think we are well aware as DQI
group that we're going to join the docs.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25612-2
03:46:51.837 --> 03:46:57.094
So it could be that you know that you're
moving because it's not a surprise that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25620-0
03:46:58.814 --> 03:47:00.094
So actually it could be the rules that.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25665-0
03:47:00.774 --> 03:47:03.214
Maybe don't mind that's if you know,
in a month's time you're.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25666-0
03:47:03.214 --> 03:47:04.054
Moving.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25667-0
03:47:04.974 --> 03:47:07.526
Mm-hmm.
Because you might say that the desk is

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25667-1
03:47:07.526 --> 03:47:11.056
you're keeping, you know,
buying it's in the house. But equally,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25667-2
03:47:11.056 --> 03:47:13.554
when you're leaving,
your effective end date,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25667-3
03:47:13.554 --> 03:47:17.138
you've got a month's notice.
You can't buy your 250 an hour then.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25667-4
03:47:17.138 --> 03:47:19.854
So we can put some thresholds around
those dates.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25694-0
03:47:20.664 --> 03:47:23.292
For particularly for moving and leaving
to protect you,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25694-1
03:47:23.292 --> 03:47:27.234
that actually you might want to wait till
you move to get the desk or you might you

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25694-2
03:47:27.234 --> 03:47:30.144
know you're not allowed it because you're
leaving next month.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25710-0
03:47:30.894 --> 03:47:34.089
Not going to allow you know,
so there could be some rules that we can

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25710-1
03:47:34.089 --> 03:47:35.094
protect that purchase.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25722-0
03:47:35.424 --> 03:47:37.824
I think that would come under the rules,
probably under the.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25723-0
03:47:37.824 --> 03:47:38.144
Leave.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25726-0
03:47:39.264 --> 03:47:40.304
Again.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25727-0
03:47:40.894 --> 03:47:41.614
Yep, Yep.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25733-0
03:47:43.744 --> 03:47:44.344
So.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25734-0
03:47:44.754 --> 03:47:47.154
Yeah, I think it's all. Yeah, no.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25757-0
03:47:48.384 --> 03:47:51.724
We can incorporate that in our.
I think it's becoming obvious that we've

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25757-1
03:47:51.724 --> 03:47:55.521
got the up flow that actually that these
queries don't even touch you that connect

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25756-0
03:47:55.084 --> 03:47:55.764
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25757-2
03:47:55.521 --> 03:47:55.704
you.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25771-0
03:48:00.174 --> 03:48:00.614
Should we?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25772-0
03:48:03.214 --> 03:48:07.054
Should we try and wrap it?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25773-0
03:48:07.054 --> 03:48:09.734
By half one. Is that reasonable still?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25769-0
03:48:09.644 --> 03:48:09.844
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25774-0
03:48:10.294 --> 03:48:11.654
Yeah, the lunch is very good.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25778-0
03:48:13.494 --> 03:48:13.654
OK.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25805-0
03:48:15.534 --> 03:48:17.294
Unless it runs out,
do you want to go some?

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25786-0
03:48:16.344 --> 03:48:16.824
Yes.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25806-0
03:48:17.294 --> 03:48:17.734
Lunch.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25807-0
03:48:18.054 --> 03:48:22.671
Yeah. Yeah. Because we've got just,
if you just put the TQ,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25807-1
03:48:22.671 --> 03:48:27.134
I'm of recommendation down.
I think we've got rifles and.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25821-0
03:48:32.264 --> 03:48:34.817
To manage hospitality,
I'll just check on that one.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25821-1
03:48:34.817 --> 03:48:37.224
I think there was one query,
but I think that's.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25822-0
03:48:38.454 --> 03:48:38.694
Yeah.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25839-0
03:48:40.584 --> 03:48:43.605
Just have a quick look at.
Then we're reporting,

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25839-1
03:48:43.605 --> 03:48:46.504
but I think we said that we can trigger
those.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25869-0
03:48:48.424 --> 03:48:51.984
Assignments. You know that need to go to,
but they the hospitality might be

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25851-0
03:48:50.434 --> 03:48:50.874
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

842df5c2-d41c-4aa3-a0b5-26eae56ebcc0/25869-1
03:48:51.984 --> 03:48:54.795
slightly different,
but you might have some activity around
